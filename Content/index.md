Welcome to my Digital Brain. This repository is mostly a collection of my Computer Science notes at my time at the University of Adelaide, but also includes some journaling stuff as well as some of my side projects.

My philosophy when creating these notes was not to extract information and learn as quickly as possible, but to create  beautiful looking notes. I find it much easier to be motivated to do that, than learn. Though, it does help to be passionate about the things you're learning.
