> [!idea] Functions vs. Polynomials
> A **function describes a relation between a set of inputs (domain) and a set of outputs (codomain)**, where each input is mapped to exactly one output. Functions can be represented in various ways, such as equations, tables, or graphs. They can be linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric, among others.
> 
> On the other hand, a **polynomial** is a specific type of function. It is a mathematical expression **consisting of variables and coefficients with positive exponents, combined using basic arithemetic**. Polynomials are a **subset of functions**, meaning that all polynomials are functions, but not all functions are polynomials.
> 
> For example, $f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5$ is a polynomial function, while $g(x) = \sin(x)$ is a trigonometric function that is not a polynomial.

> [!example] Examples of Functions and Polynomials
> 1. Linear function: $f(x) = 2x + 1$ (also a polynomial)
> 2. Quadratic function: $g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$ (also a polynomial)
> 3. Cubic polynomial: $h(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1$
> 4. Exponential function: $i(x) = 2^x$ (not a polynomial)
> 5. Logarithmic function: $j(x) = \log_2(x)$ (not a polynomial)
> 6. Trigonometric function: $k(x) = \cos(x)$ (not a polynomial)
