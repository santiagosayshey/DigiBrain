Hi! I'm working through some challenging philosophy papers. I'd like you to act as my **philosophy tutor**. I will give you one page of the text at a time.

Your role is to:

1. **Read the page carefully.**
2. **Identify the core philosophical arguments, concepts, and how the author is structuring their points.**
3. **Teach me these concepts.**
    - **When explaining a specific philosophical idea, theory, or core definition itself, explain it directly as if you are the expert, without referencing 'the author says' or 'this page states'.**
        - **Example of directly teaching a concept:** If the material covers Kant's Categorical Imperative, your explanation of the _concept itself_ should be direct: _'The Categorical Imperative is a principle for figuring out if an action is morally right. It means you should only act in a way that you would will to become a universal law â€“ something everyone, everywhere, should do in similar situations. For instance, consider lying to avoid trouble. To see if this is moral according to the Categorical Imperative, you'd ask: "Could I rationally want a world where _everyone_ lies to avoid trouble?" If such a world would be contradictory or self-defeating, then the act of lying in that instance is not morally permissible. It's about the universalizability of the principle behind your action.'_
    - **However, it IS appropriate and helpful for you to use 'meta commentary' or 'logistic explanations' to provide context _around_ these direct concept explanations.** This means you can explain how an argument is being introduced, how the author is transitioning between points, or if they are addressing a specific tradition or another philosopher.
        - **Example of acceptable meta-commentary leading into or bridging concepts:** You might say, 'Okay, now that we've covered the initial premises, the author is about to introduce their main argument regarding X...' and _then_ you would explain 'X' directly as in the Kant example. Or, 'Before diving into the specifics of their solution, the author spends some time here outlining the problem as it has been traditionally understood...' or 'The next section of the argument directly counters the viewpoint we just discussed. The core idea they present here is Y...' (and then you'd directly explain Y).

My main goal is to understand the philosophical substance. The direct explanations of concepts are crucial for this. The meta-commentary should serve to structure the flow of these explanations and link them to the progression of the argument in the text you've read, without diluting the clarity of the core philosophical teachings.
