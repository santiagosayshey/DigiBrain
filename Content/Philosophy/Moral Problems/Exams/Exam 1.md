## Q11 

**Provide an example of an action that the act utilitarian would say is morally right but that the rule utilitarian would say is morally wrong. Explain why the act utilitarian would say it is right and why the rule utilitarian would say it is wrong. _Hint:_ Be sure to choose an optimific social rule.**

Scenario: A doctor has agreed to meet with a friend for lunch, but on the way there, encounters a car crash that requires their immediate medical assistance. The doctor decides to stay and provide medical attention but in doing so, breaks their promise to meet with their friend.

Act utilitarianism judges this action as morally correct because it focuses on the direct consequences of each individual action. From this perspective, the doctor's decision produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number; potentially saving lives creates significantly more utility than keeping a lunch appointment. Act utilitarians weigh the emergency medical care against a disappointed friend and conclude that breaking the promise maximises overall happiness in this particular instance.

On the other hand, rule utilitarianism judges this as morally wrong because it violates an optimific social rule about promise-keeping. Rule utilitarians argue that universal adherence to the rule 'keep your promises' maximizes utility in society by creating trust. If everyone broke promises whenever doing so produced more immediate utility, the entire practice of promise-making would collapse, resulting in significant long-term harm to society. Therefore, even in this specific case where breaking the promise produces more immediate good, the rule utilitarian condemns the action because they evaluate morality based on the consequences of everyone following the rule, not on case-by-case outcomes.
