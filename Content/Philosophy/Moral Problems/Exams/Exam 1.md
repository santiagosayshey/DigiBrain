## Q11 

**Provide an example of an action that the act utilitarian would say is morally right but that the rule utilitarian would say is morally wrong. Explain why the act utilitarian would say it is right and why the rule utilitarian would say it is wrong. _Hint:_ Be sure to choose an optimific social rule.**

Scenario: A doctor has agreed to meet with a friend for lunch, but on the way there, encounters a car crash that requires their immediate medical assistance. The doctor decides to stay and provide medical attention but in doing so, breaks their promise to meet with their friend.

Act utilitarianism judges this action as morally correct because it focuses on the direct consequences of each individual action. From this perspective, the doctor's decision produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number; potentially saving lives creates significantly more utility than keeping a lunch appointment. Act utilitarians weigh the emergency medical care against a disappointed friend and conclude that breaking the promise maximises overall happiness in this particular instance.

On the other hand, rule utilitarianism judges this as morally wrong because it violates an optimific social rule about promise-keeping. Rule utilitarians argue that universal adherence to the rule 'keep your promises' maximizes utility in society by creating trust. If everyone broke promises whenever doing so produced more immediate utility, the entire practice of promise-making would collapse, resulting in significant long-term harm to society. Therefore, even in this specific case where breaking the promise produces more immediate good, the rule utilitarian condemns the action because they evaluate morality based on the consequences of everyone following the rule, not on case-by-case outcomes.

## Q12

**Explain the difference between acting for the sake of duty versus acting merely in accordance with duty. As part of your explanation, provide an example of each.**

In Kantian ethics, the moral worth of an action depends on the motivation behind it, not merely its outcome. Acting "for the sake of duty" means performing an action solely because one recognises it as morally required by reason, which expresses Kant's concept of the Good Will; the only thing that is good without qualification. This contrasts with acting "merely in accordance with duty," where one's actions align with moral requirements but are motivated by inclination, self-interest, or other non-moral reasons.

For Kant, only actions done for the sake of duty possess genuine moral worth. When we act from duty, we act from the Good Will itself, demonstrating our rational capacity to recognise and follow moral law out of respect for it alone.

Consider two people helping an elderly woman cross a busy street:

Person A is late for a lecture but stops to help because they recognise a universal duty to assist vulnerable individuals when possible. Despite the personal inconvenience, they act purely out of a sense of moral obligation. This represents acting for the sake of duty and manifests the Good Will.

Person B helps the elderly woman because they enjoy the feeling of being charitable and want others to see them as virtuous. While their action conforms to duty and produces good outcomes, it is motivated by inclination and self-satisfaction rather than respect for duty itself. This represents acting merely in accordance with duty.


## Essay

Certain moral duties bind us absolutely, requiring unwavering commitment regardless of potential outcomes. When we begin allowing exceptions based on subjective judgements of consequences, we undermine the very foundation of morality itself. Kant's ethical framework addresses this through his concept of the categorical imperative, which establishes universal moral principles that apply without exception. In this essay, I will argue that from a Kantian perspective, both Sam and Bob acted immorally by breaking their promises. I will analyse both Sam's and Bob's cases using the categorical imperative to show why their actions violated moral law, then address the consequentialist objection that rigid promise-keeping leads to worse outcomes before defending how allowing exceptions creates a dangerous slippery slope threatening all moral duties.

Sam's decision to redirect his friend's fortune to a children's hospital was not morally permissible because it violates Kant's categorical imperative. First, considering the universalisation formula, we must ask whether Sam's maxim, "I will break promises when I believe doing so leads to better outcomes", could be universalised without contradiction. If universalised, the institution of promise-making would collapse as promises would lose their binding force, as recipients would have no reason to trust that promises would be kept when the promise-maker found a seemingly "better" alternative. The practice would become meaningless, creating a contradiction in conception—we cannot coherently will a world where promises exist but are systematically undermined. Second, Sam's actions fail the humanity formula by treating his deceased friend Dan merely as a means to achieving charitable ends rather than respecting him as an end in himself. By disregarding Dan's explicit wishes concerning his own property, Sam substituted his own judgement about the best use of the fortune, effectively using Dan's resources to pursue Sam's conception of the good rather than honouring Dan's autonomy and moral agency. This treatment violates Kant's requirement to respect the dignity of rational beings.

Bob's decision to delay repayment to Amy was likewise morally impermissible. While Bob's desire to treat his daughter as an end in herself by providing her with a meaningful experience is commendable, he does so at the expense of treating Amy merely as a means. By unilaterally changing the terms of their agreement without Amy's consent, Bob instrumentalises Amy's resources for his own purposes, disregarding her autonomy to his priorities. This creates a moral asymmetry where Bob privileges his daughter's happiness over his moral obligation to Amy. Though Bob might justify this as choosing between two ends—his daughter and Amy—Kant's framework does not permit such trade-offs when they involve breaking perfect duties. Furthermore, Bob's maxim of "I will delay repaying debts when doing so allows me to bring joy to someone else" suffers from the same contradiction in conception as Sam's case. If universalised, this principle would undermine the practice of lending, as lenders could never rely on timely repayment if borrowers found alternative uses they deemed more valuable or pressing.

A consequentialist might object that Kant's rigid adherence to promise-keeping leads to patently worse outcomes in both cases. In Sam's case, directing funds to a children's hospital could save lives, while a jockey club merely provides entertainment. Similarly, Bob's delay harms Amy minimally while providing significant joy to his daughter. However, this objection misses the fundamental danger in permitting exceptions to perfect duties based on subjective judgements of better outcomes. Once we allow moral agents to break promises whenever they personally determine that doing so would produce more good, we create a slippery slope that ultimately undermines all moral obligations. Consider how quickly this reasoning deteriorates: If Sam can redirect Dan's fortune based on his subjective judgement of "better outcomes," what prevents any trustee from redirecting charitable donations to their own family's needs, claiming their intimate knowledge of those needs makes this the "better" outcome? There is no principled stopping point once subjective judgement of consequences becomes the deciding factor. The very concept of binding obligations would collapse, as any duty could be overridden by claiming a marginally better outcome elsewhere.

Kant's framework reveals both Sam and Bob's promise-breaking as morally impermissible, violating both universal law and humanity formulations of the categorical imperative. Though the rigid nature of perfect duties may appear unnecessarily strict when better outcomes seem possible, this inflexibility serves a vital purpose. It preserves the integrity of moral obligations against the slippery slope of subjective exceptions. Without absolute prohibitions against breaking perfect duties like promise-keeping, any obligation could be discarded through personal judgments of "better" outcomes, ultimately dissolving the foundation of morality itself. By maintaining that certain duties bind absolutely, Kant protects both the meaning of promises and the dignity of rational beings—safeguarding morality from degenerating into mere situational calculations of convenience.
