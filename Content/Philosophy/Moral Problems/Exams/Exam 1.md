## Q11 

**Provide an example of an action that the act utilitarian would say is morally right but that the rule utilitarian would say is morally wrong. Explain why the act utilitarian would say it is right and why the rule utilitarian would say it is wrong. _Hint:_ Be sure to choose an optimific social rule.**

Scenario: A doctor has agreed to meet with a friend for lunch, but on the way there, encounters a car crash that requires their immediate medical assistance. The doctor decides to stay and provide medical attention but in doing so, breaks their promise to meet with their friend.

Act utilitarianism judges this action as morally correct because it focuses on the direct consequences of each individual action. From this perspective, the doctor's decision produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number; potentially saving lives creates significantly more utility than keeping a lunch appointment. Act utilitarians weigh the emergency medical care against a disappointed friend and conclude that breaking the promise maximises overall happiness in this particular instance.

On the other hand, rule utilitarianism judges this as morally wrong because it violates an optimific social rule about promise-keeping. Rule utilitarians argue that universal adherence to the rule 'keep your promises' maximizes utility in society by creating trust. If everyone broke promises whenever doing so produced more immediate utility, the entire practice of promise-making would collapse, resulting in significant long-term harm to society. Therefore, even in this specific case where breaking the promise produces more immediate good, the rule utilitarian condemns the action because they evaluate morality based on the consequences of everyone following the rule, not on case-by-case outcomes.

## Q12

**Explain the difference between acting for the sake of duty versus acting merely in accordance with duty. As part of your explanation, provide an example of each.**

In Kantian ethics, the moral worth of an action depends on the motivation behind it, not merely its outcome. Acting "for the sake of duty" means performing an action solely because one recognises it as morally required by reason, which expresses Kant's concept of the Good Will; the only thing that is good without qualification. This contrasts with acting "merely in accordance with duty," where one's actions align with moral requirements but are motivated by inclination, self-interest, or other non-moral reasons.

For Kant, only actions done for the sake of duty possess genuine moral worth. When we act from duty, we act from the Good Will itself, demonstrating our rational capacity to recognise and follow moral law out of respect for it alone.

Consider two people helping an elderly woman cross a busy street:

Person A is late for a lecture but stops to help because they recognise a universal duty to assist vulnerable individuals when possible. Despite the personal inconvenience, they act purely out of a sense of moral obligation. This represents acting for the sake of duty and manifests the Good Will.

Person B helps the elderly woman because they enjoy the feeling of being charitable and want others to see them as virtuous. While their action conforms to duty and produces good outcomes, it is motivated by inclination and self-satisfaction rather than respect for duty itself. This represents acting merely in accordance with duty.


## Essay


Perfect duties are moral obligations that must be followed regardless of their outcomes. If we allow these outcomes to dictate whether we see something as a perfect duty or not, we lose sight of what makes something morally permissible in the first place. Kant's ethical framework addresses this through his concept of the categorical imperative, which establishes universal moral principles that apply without exception. In this essay, I will argue that from a Kantian perspective, both Sam and Bob acted immorally by breaking a perfect duty to keep their promises. I will analyse Sam's case first and Bob's second, applying the categorical imperative to show why their actions violated moral law. I will then address the consequentialist objection before defending why allowing exceptions to perfect duties creates a dangerous slippery slope.

Sam's decision to ignore Dan's wishes and use his fortune to help a children's hospital was not morally permissible because it violates Kant's categorical imperative. First, considering the universalisation formula, we must ask whether Sam's maxim, "I will break promises when I believe doing so leads to better outcomes", could be universalised without contradiction. Consider that in a world in which everyone broke promises to get what they wanted, nobody would trust each other because nobody would believe each other's word (Lecture 4, Slide 25). As such, the practice would become meaningless, creating a contradiction in conception; we cannot coherently will a world where promises exist but are consistently broken. Second, Sam's actions fail the humanity formula by treating Dan merely as a means rather than respecting him as an end in himself. Sam judges Dan's wishes as morally inferior to his own, essentially stealing his fortune to pursue his own conception of good rather than honouring Dan's autonomy and agency by donating to his favourite jockey club. Sam's treatment of Dan fails to respect his dignity, and as such, violates the humanity formula.

Similarly, Bob's promise to pay Amy back, knowing full well that he could never fulfil it, was likewise morally impermissible. While Bob's desire to treat his daughter as an end in herself by providing her with a meaningful experience is commendable, he does so at the expense of treating Amy merely as a means. Bob takes advantage of this agreement by changing its terms without consulting Amy, undermining her dignity and treating her in a way that she could not rationally consent to (Lecture 5, Slide 51). This reveals a double standard in how Bob privileges his daughter, but neglects his promise to Amy. Though Bob might justify this as choosing between two ends, Kant's framework does not permit prioritising one perfect duty over another. Furthermore, Bob's maxim of "I will delay repaying debts when doing so allows me to bring joy to someone else" suffers from the same contradiction in conception as Sam's case. If universalised, this principle would undermine the practice of lending, as lenders could never rely on timely repayment if borrowers found alternative uses they deemed more valuable or pressing.

A consequentialist would object that Kant's rigid adherence to promise-keeping leads to arguably worse outcomes in both cases. From this perspective, Sam's re-purposing of funds to a children's hospital maximises utility by saving lives. Similarly, a consequentialist would argue that Bob's choice to use Amy's money on his daughter creates greater overall happiness; Amy suffers minimal harm from waiting, while his daughter gains significant joy from a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, this objection misses why perfect duties exist in the first place. Once we allow ourselves to break promises whenever we personally determine that doing so would produce more good, we create a slippery slope that undermines all future moral obligations. Consider how quickly this reasoning deteriorates: If Sam can re-purpose Dan's fortune based on his judgement of "better outcomes," what prevents a tradie from breaking agreements to use cheaper materials, or a judge from ignoring legal precedent? Promises at every level, from personal to constitutional, could be overridden by claiming a slightly better outcome elsewhere. Once placed on a slippery slope, we are bound to slide down to a bad place (Lecture 8, Slide 20).

Kant's framework reveals both Sam and Bob's promise-breaking as morally impermissible because it violates both the universal and humanity formulations of the categorical imperative. Though the rigid nature of perfect duties may appear unnecessarily strict when better outcomes seem possible, this rigidity serves a vital purpose. It preserves the integrity of moral obligations against the slippery slope of subjective exceptions. By maintaining that certain duties must always followed, Kant protects both the meaning of promises and the dignity of rational beings, safeguarding morality from degenerating into mere situational calculations of convenience.
