## Q11 

**Provide an example of an action that the act utilitarian would say is morally right but that the rule utilitarian would say is morally wrong. Explain why the act utilitarian would say it is right and why the rule utilitarian would say it is wrong. _Hint:_ Be sure to choose an optimific social rule.**

Scenario: A doctor has agreed to meet with a friend for lunch, but on the way there, encounters a car crash that requires their immediate medical assistance. The doctor decides to stay and provide medical attention but in doing so, breaks their promise to meet with their friend.

Act utilitarianism judges this action as morally correct because it focuses on the direct consequences of each individual action. From this perspective, the doctor's decision produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number; potentially saving lives creates significantly more utility than keeping a lunch appointment. Act utilitarians weigh the emergency medical care against a disappointed friend and conclude that breaking the promise maximises overall happiness in this particular instance.

On the other hand, rule utilitarianism judges this as morally wrong because it violates an optimific social rule about promise-keeping. Rule utilitarians argue that universal adherence to the rule 'keep your promises' maximizes utility in society by creating trust. If everyone broke promises whenever doing so produced more immediate utility, the entire practice of promise-making would collapse, resulting in significant long-term harm to society. Therefore, even in this specific case where breaking the promise produces more immediate good, the rule utilitarian condemns the action because they evaluate morality based on the consequences of everyone following the rule, not on case-by-case outcomes.

## Q12

**Explain the difference between acting for the sake of duty versus acting merely in accordance with duty. As part of your explanation, provide an example of each.**

In Kantian ethics, the moral worth of an action depends on the motivation behind it, not merely its outcome. Acting "for the sake of duty" means performing an action solely because one recognises it as morally required by reason, which expresses Kant's concept of the Good Will; the only thing that is good without qualification. This contrasts with acting "merely in accordance with duty," where one's actions align with moral requirements but are motivated by inclination, self-interest, or other non-moral reasons.

For Kant, only actions done for the sake of duty possess genuine moral worth. When we act from duty, we act from the Good Will itself, demonstrating our rational capacity to recognise and follow moral law out of respect for it alone.

Consider two people helping an elderly woman cross a busy street:

Person A is late for a lecture but stops to help because they recognise a universal duty to assist vulnerable individuals when possible. Despite the personal inconvenience, they act purely out of a sense of moral obligation. This represents acting for the sake of duty and manifests the Good Will.

Person B helps the elderly woman because they enjoy the feeling of being charitable and want others to see them as virtuous. While their action conforms to duty and produces good outcomes, it is motivated by inclination and self-satisfaction rather than respect for duty itself. This represents acting merely in accordance with duty.


## Essay

Certain moral duties bind us absolutely, requiring unwavering commitment regardless of circumstances or potential outcomes. When we permit exceptions based on subjective judgments of better consequences, we undermine the very concept of moral obligation. 

Kantian ethics formalizes this concern through the concept of perfect duties—absolute moral requirements that cannot be broken even for seemingly beneficial outcomes. Promise-keeping represents one such perfect duty, which must be honored regardless of the consequences. While intuition might suggest that promises could be justifiably broken when doing so leads to better outcomes, such reasoning contradicts Kant's categorical imperative, which demands that moral principles be universalizable.

In this essay, I will argue that from a Kantian perspective, both Sam and Bob acted immorally by breaking their promises, regardless of their intentions or the consequences they sought to achieve. First, I will analyze Sam's case using Kant's categorical imperative to demonstrate why redirecting his friend's fortune violated perfect duties. Next, I will apply the same framework to Bob's case to show why his delayed repayment was similarly impermissible. I will then address consequentialist objections that might be raised against both analyses, and finally defend the Kantian approach by explaining why allowing exceptions to promise-keeping creates an untenable moral framework.
