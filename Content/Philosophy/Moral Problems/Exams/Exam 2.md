Short Answer Notes
- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright. 
- What i think here is that abortion is prima facie seriously wrong, then so is inprisonment, which does not hold. 

Premise 1 assumes that having a 'future like ours' is sufficient criteria to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. However, this is far too broad. 

Consider the death penalty. Death row inmates unquestionably have futures like ours, but also presents too; they possess consciousness, desires and relationships, albeit in limited capacity. If P1 were true, then their execution would be prima facie seriously morally wrong solely because they have futures like ours. Yet, many who oppose abortion, also support the death penalty, and even those who oppose both don't typically claim they're wrong for the same reason; depriving someone of a future. 

This suggests that having a future like ours
