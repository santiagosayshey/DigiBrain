**Notes**

- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright. 
- What i think here is that abortion is prima facie seriously wrong, then so is inprisonment, which does not hold. 

**Draft**

Premise 1 assumes that having a 'future like ours' is sufficient criteria to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. However, this criterion proves too much.

Consider the death penalty. Death row inmates unquestionably have futures like ours. If P1 were true, then their execution would be prima facie  morally wrong solely due to their futures. Yet many who oppose abortion support the death penalty, and even those who oppose both don't typically claim they're wrong for the same reason: depriving someone of a future. This suggests having a future like ours isn't sufficient to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. Other morally relevant factors must matter - perhaps innocence or personhood. But once we admit these matter, Marquis' argument loses its force.

Marquis might respond that the death penalty IS prima facie seriously morally wrong, but this wrongness can be overridden by considerations like justice or deterrence. However, this response faces a dilemma. If prima facie wrongness can be so easily overridden in the case of execution, then the same should apply to abortion - it could be prima facie wrong, but overridden by considerations like bodily autonomy. This undermines Marquis' argument.

Moreover, death penalty supporters don't see execution as even prima facie wrong - they believe certain criminals deserve death. This reveals that 'having a future like ours' isn't doing the moral work Marquis claims.

Therefore, P1 fails because 'having a future like ours' is neither sufficient nor the genuine basis for our moral judgments about killing.

lets think about the thesis a bit more. lets flesh it out a bit.

- Broome's distinction of private and public morality is a false dichotomy. That is to say, we should not consider one  more or less important than the other. 
- I suggest we bridge this gap and go back to some kind of unified morality - one where both side's duties are equally important.
- Why? This creates an issue of blame - whose fault is it that we are in a crisis and who needs to do something about it? We all are! Not just people or the government. we are one collective responsible for everyone. (this is implied that yes there is a climate crisis and yes we do need to do something about it)
- I feel like theres something to tie back to euthenasia / normative ethics with kid drowning in pond and everyone having a duty to go save them (not just the first person that jumps in)
- More concretely, we can say that governments have an imperfect duty to set the foundation for individual perfect duties. They must set carbon tax laws. Ensure we have ways to measure our impact. Fairly distribute offsetting / reperation duties according to our measured impact. How they do so is not important - hence why its imperfect, but they must do so. 
- Then using this, individuals have a perfect duty to follow these rules. If the government says they must offset according to their impact, they can and should do so. 

clarifying.....
- public / private morality split creates a false dichotomy enabling mutual deflection of responsibility
	- Without infrastructure, individual action feels futile
	- Without individual compliance, infrastructure fails
	- Both governments and individuals can harm through emissions
	- Just as Marquis showed that the personhood debate in abortion ethics was a philosophical dead-end that prevented moral clarity, the public/private morality split in climate ethics similarly obscures our collective moral obligations.
- climate change is like 100 people watching a child slowly drown - it seems silly that if nobody else is going to save them then you shouldn't either (singer fair share objection). everyone has duties
- duties of goodness are toothless - we have a duty of goodness to throw recyclables in the yellow bin yet some of us don't and face no repercussions. 
- Climate emissions cause harm, therefore it's about justice not goodness
- Governments have imperfect duty of justice to create infrastructure
- Individuals have imperfect duty of justice to use that infrastructure to reduce emissions / offset their emissions / vote for these policies / parties
- These duties are symbiotic/mutually constitutive, not sequential
- Singer's proximity irrelevance applies - institutional distance doesn't matter
- We all stand at the water's edge of climate catastrophe

### **Introduction**

- Hook: Climate paralysis despite urgency
- Thesis: Public/private morality split creates false dichotomy enabling mutual deflection of responsibility
- Signposting: Will show why this split fails, establish duties of justice for both parties, demonstrate their symbiotic relationship

### **Body Paragraph 1: The False Dichotomy Problem**

- Public/private split enables mutual deflection
- Without infrastructure, individual action feels futile
- Without individual compliance, infrastructure fails
- Both can harm through emissions
- Parallel to Marquis: wrong framework obscures real moral issues

### **Body Paragraph 2: Universal Duties of Justice**

- Drowning child: 100 observers all have duties (Singer)
- Duties of goodness are toothless (recycling example)
- Climate emissions cause harm = justice issue
- Both governments and individuals harm through emissions
- Therefore both have duties of justice, not optional goodness

### **Body Paragraph 3: The Symbiotic Framework**

- Government imperfect duty: create infrastructure (carbon pricing, measurement, offsets)
- Individual imperfect duty: reduce emissions through available means AND political participation
- These are mutually constitutive, not sequential
- Singer's proximity irrelevance extends to institutional distance
- We all stand at the water's edge

### **Objection 1: The Sequential Impossibility**

- Your framework seems to require government infrastructure before individuals can act
- But governments are made of individuals - why would they create infrastructure without pre-existing duties?
- Appears to be circular/chicken-egg problem
- Response: Misunderstands the framework - both have imperfect duties of justice simultaneously
- Individuals must reduce emissions AND create political conditions for infrastructure
- Governments must build infrastructure AND respond to citizen demands
- These duties are mutually reinforcing, not sequential
- Like Singer's drowning child - everyone at the pond has immediate duties regardless of others' actions
### **Objection 2: The Collective Action Futility**

- Even with infrastructure, why comply if others don't?
- My action makes no difference either way
- Response: Singer's fair share - "others aren't helping" doesn't excuse inaction
- Drowning child parallel
- Perfect duties remain binding regardless of others' compliance
- Just deflecting to other individuals instead of government
### **Conclusion**

- Restate unified framework
- Emphasize urgency and collective responsibility
- Call to action

writing (Draft 1)....

As climate catastrophe accelerates, humanity faces a responsibility deadlock: governments await individual action while individuals demand government intervention. This mutual finger-pointing stems from an artificial division between public and private morality in climate ethics; a false dichotomy that enables mutual deflection of responsibility. This essay argues that climate change demands a unified moral framework where both governments and individuals bear imperfect duties of justice, not merely optional duties of goodness. I will first demonstrate how the public/private split obscures our collective obligations, then establish why climate emissions constitute matters of justice, and finally show how governmental and individual duties form a symbiotic relationship essential for addressing our climate crisis. I will then address two objections: that my framework creates an impossible starting point where neither party can act first, and that individual compliance remains irrational even with infrastructure in place.

The conventional separation of climate ethics into public and private morality creates a destructive cycle of mutual deflection. When moral duties are divided between governmental "public" responsibilities and individual "private" obligations, each sphere can perpetually point to the other as the primary agent of change. Individuals rightfully observe that without carbon pricing, measurement tools, or offset infrastructure, their personal actions feel futile. Governments simultaneously argue that without citizen buy-in and behavioural change, even the best-designed policies will fail. This very dichotomy explains why philosophers like Sinnott-Armstrong, after examining numerous moral principles, conclude that individuals lack climate obligations—they search for duties within an isolated "private" sphere when the obligations are fundamentally collective (Sinnott-Armstrong, 309). This framing obscures a crucial reality: both governments and individuals directly contribute to climate harm through their emissions. Like Marquis, who showed that debating personhood characteristics leads to an unresolvable standoff when what we need is to understand the fundamental wrong of killing (Marquis, 348), the public/private split in climate ethics similarly creates a standoff that obscures our need to understand the fundamental wrong of emissions.

To understand why both governments and individuals bear climate responsibilities, we must first establish what kind of moral duty climate action represents. Consider our supposed duty to recycle: we ought to place bottles and cardboard in yellow bins, yet those who ignore these duties face no moral condemnation. This exemplifies the weakness of duties of goodness—they lack genuine moral force. But climate change is fundamentally different. Unlike recycling, greenhouse gas emissions directly harm others through rising seas, deadly heat waves, and devastating storms. As Broome argues, when individuals emit greenhouse gases, they harm others without compensation, violating the fundamental duty of justice not to harm (Broome, 306). Governments bear even greater responsibility: by permitting corporations to emit massive quantities of greenhouse gases without regulation, they enable harm on an industrial scale, violating duties of justice to protect their citizens and the global community. Singer's principle reinforces this universal obligation: if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it (Singer, 231). Both governments and individuals possess this power to prevent climate harms, making both bearers of duties of justice, not merely optional goodness.

Having established that both governments and individuals bear duties of justice, we must now examine how these obligations function in unison. Governments have an imperfect duty to create infrastructure that prevents climate harm; carbon pricing that internalises costs, measurement systems that track emissions, and regulated offset markets. Individuals have a corresponding imperfect duty to utilise this infrastructure; reducing emissions through available means and offsetting what remains. These duties are imperfect because both parties retain flexibility in method: governments might tax petrol at the pump or charge factories for each tonne emitted, while individuals may reduce through less driving, improved insulation, or dietary changes. What matters is achieving emissions reduction, not the specific means chosen. The symbiosis emerges because these duties are mutually enabling: without infrastructure, individuals cannot meaningfully measure or offset their emissions; without individual participation, infrastructure serves no purpose. Singer's principle that institutional distance is morally irrelevant applies here; we cannot excuse inaction simply because our duty depends on another sphere also acting (Singer, 232). In our climate crisis, we all stand at the water's edge, bearing interdependent obligations that, while imperfect in method, are absolute in their demand for justice.

One might object that my framework creates an impossible starting point. If individuals need government infrastructure to discharge their duties meaningfully, and governments need citizen support to create infrastructure, then neither can act first. This appears to trap us in perpetual inaction, each sphere awaiting the other's initiative. his objection misunderstands the nature of imperfect duties. Both obligations exist simultaneously and can be pursued immediately through available means. Individuals need not await perfect infrastructure—they can reduce emissions now through personal choices while advocating for systemic change through voting and political engagement. Similarly, governments need not await unanimous support—they can implement initial carbon pricing, begin emissions monitoring, and establish preliminary offset systems. The symbiosis isn't sequential but dynamic: as each sphere acts, it enables greater action from the other.
