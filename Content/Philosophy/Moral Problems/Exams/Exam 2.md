**Notes**

- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright. 
- What i think here is that abortion is prima facie seriously wrong, then so is inprisonment, which does not hold. 

**Draft**

Premise 1 assumes that having a 'future like ours' is sufficient criteria to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. However, this criterion proves too much.

Consider the death penalty. Death row inmates unquestionably have futures like ours. If P1 were true, then their execution would be prima facie  morally wrong solely due to their futures. Yet many who oppose abortion support the death penalty, and even those who oppose both don't typically claim they're wrong for the same reason: depriving someone of a future. This suggests having a future like ours isn't sufficient to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. Other morally relevant factors must matter - perhaps innocence or personhood. But once we admit these matter, Marquis' argument loses its force.

Marquis might respond that the death penalty IS prima facie seriously morally wrong, but this wrongness can be overridden by considerations like justice or deterrence. However, this response faces a dilemma. If prima facie wrongness can be so easily overridden in the case of execution, then the same should apply to abortion - it could be prima facie wrong, but overridden by considerations like bodily autonomy. This undermines Marquis' argument.

Moreover, death penalty supporters don't see execution as even prima facie wrong - they believe certain criminals deserve death. This reveals that 'having a future like ours' isn't doing the moral work Marquis claims.

Therefore, P1 fails because 'having a future like ours' is neither sufficient nor the genuine basis for our moral judgments about killing.

lets think about the thesis a bit more. lets flesh it out a bit.

- Broome's distinction of private and public morality is a false dichotomy. That is to say, we should not consider one  more or less important than the other. 
- I suggest we bridge this gap and go back to some kind of unified morality - one where both side's duties are equally important.
- Why? This creates an issue of blame - whose fault is it that we are in a crisis and who needs to do something about it? We all are! Not just people or the government. we are one collective responsible for everyone. (this is implied that yes there is a climate crisis and yes we do need to do something about it)
- I feel like theres something to tie back to euthenasia / normative ethics with kid drowning in pond and everyone having a duty to go save them (not just the first person that jumps in)
- More concretely, we can say that governments have an imperfect duty to set the foundation for individual perfect duties. They must set carbon tax laws. Ensure we have ways to measure our impact. Fairly distribute offsetting / reperation duties according to our measured impact. How they do so is not important - hence why its imperfect, but they must do so. 
- Then using this, individuals have a perfect duty to follow these rules. If the government says they must offset according to their impact, they can and should do so. 

clarifying.....
- public / private morality split creates a false dichotomy enabling moral buck passing
- climate change is like 100 people watching a child slowly drown - it seems silly that if nobody else is going to save them then you shouldn't either (singer fair share objection). everyone has duties
- duties of goodness are toothless - we have a duty of goodness to throw recyclables in the yellow bin yet some of us don't and face no repercussions. 
- Climate emissions cause harm, therefore it's about justice not goodness
- Governments have imperfect duty of justice to create infrastructure
