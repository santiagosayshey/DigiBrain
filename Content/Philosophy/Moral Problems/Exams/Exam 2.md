Short Answer Notes
- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright. 
- What i think here is that abortion is prima facie seriously wrong, then so is inprisonment, which does not hold. 

Premise 1 assumes that having a 'future like ours' is sufficient criteria to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. However, this is far too broad.

Consider the death penalty. Death row inmates unquestionably have futures like ours. In fact, they have even more than fetuses, possessing current consciousness, desires and relationships. If P1 were true, then their execution would be prima facie seriously morally wrong solely because they have futures like ours. Yet, many who oppose abortion also support the death penalty, and even those who oppose both don't typically claim they're wrong for the same reason: depriving someone of a future. This suggests that having a future like ours is not sufficient by itself to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. Other morally relevant factors must matter - perhaps innocence, personhood or social relationships. But once we admit these matter, Marquis' argument loses its force.

A defender of Marquis might argue that the death penalty IS prima facie seriously morally wrong, but this wrongness can be overridden by moral considerations like justice or deterrence. Since it is not absolute, but rather the all things considered duty, P1 remains true. However, this response faces a dilemma. If prima facie wrongness can be so easily overridden in the case of execution, then the same should apply to abortion - it could be prima facie wrong, but overridden by considerations like bodily autonomy, economic hardship or fetal health concerns. This completely undermines Marquis' goal of showing abortion is seriously morally wrong in most cases.


Therefore, P1 fails because 'having a future like ours' is neither sufficient nor the genuine basis for our moral judgments about killing.
