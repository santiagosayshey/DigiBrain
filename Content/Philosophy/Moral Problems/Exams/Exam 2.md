Short Answer Notes
- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright.
