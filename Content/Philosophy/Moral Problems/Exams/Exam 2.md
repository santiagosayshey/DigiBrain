**Notes**

- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright. 
- What i think here is that abortion is prima facie seriously wrong, then so is inprisonment, which does not hold. 

**Draft**

Premise 1 assumes that having a 'future like ours' is sufficient criteria to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. However, this criterion proves too much.

Consider the death penalty. Death row inmates unquestionably have futures like ours. If P1 were true, then their execution would be prima facie  morally wrong solely due to their futures. Yet many who oppose abortion support the death penalty, and even those who oppose both don't typically claim they're wrong for the same reason: depriving someone of a future. This suggests having a future like ours isn't sufficient to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. Other morally relevant factors must matter - perhaps innocence or personhood. But once we admit these matter, Marquis' argument loses its force.

Marquis might respond that the death penalty IS prima facie seriously morally wrong, but this wrongness can be overridden by considerations like justice or deterrence. However, this response faces a dilemma. If prima facie wrongness can be so easily overridden in the case of execution, then the same should apply to abortion - it could be prima facie wrong, but overridden by considerations like bodily autonomy. This undermines Marquis' argument.

Moreover, death penalty supporters don't see execution as even prima facie wrong - they believe certain criminals deserve death. This reveals that 'having a future like ours' isn't doing the moral work Marquis claims.

Therefore, P1 fails because 'having a future like ours' is neither sufficient nor the genuine basis for our moral judgments about killing.
