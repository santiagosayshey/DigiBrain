**Notes**

- not sound, argue against premise 1: If a standard fetus has a future like ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong.
- lets consider what this actually says - what i believe its saying is that it is wrong on first glance to kill something that has a future - rather it is wrong to take the future of something away. 
- now, consider other scenarios where we take futures like ours away from people - imprisonment. 
- A prisoner has a future like ours (perhaps even moreso than fetuses because they already have a present like ours), yet, not only do lock them up and take away their right to life, we sometimes kill them outright. 
- What i think here is that abortion is prima facie seriously wrong, then so is inprisonment, which does not hold. 

**Draft**

Premise 1 assumes that having a 'future like ours' is sufficient criteria to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. However, this criterion proves too much.

Consider the death penalty. Death row inmates unquestionably have futures like ours. If P1 were true, then their execution would be prima facie  morally wrong solely due to their futures. Yet many who oppose abortion support the death penalty, and even those who oppose both don't typically claim they're wrong for the same reason: depriving someone of a future. This suggests having a future like ours isn't sufficient to make killing prima facie seriously morally wrong. Other morally relevant factors must matter - perhaps innocence or personhood. But once we admit these matter, Marquis' argument loses its force.

Marquis might respond that the death penalty IS prima facie seriously morally wrong, but this wrongness can be overridden by considerations like justice or deterrence. However, this response faces a dilemma. If prima facie wrongness can be so easily overridden in the case of execution, then the same should apply to abortion - it could be prima facie wrong, but overridden by considerations like bodily autonomy. This undermines Marquis' argument.

Moreover, death penalty supporters don't see execution as even prima facie wrong - they believe certain criminals deserve death. This reveals that 'having a future like ours' isn't doing the moral work Marquis claims.

Therefore, P1 fails because 'having a future like ours' is neither sufficient nor the genuine basis for our moral judgments about killing.

lets think about the thesis a bit more. lets flesh it out a bit.

- Broome's distinction of private and public morality is a false dichotomy. That is to say, we should not consider one  more or less important than the other. 
- I suggest we bridge this gap and go back to some kind of unified morality - one where both side's duties are equally important.
- Why? This creates an issue of blame - whose fault is it that we are in a crisis and who needs to do something about it? We all are! Not just people or the government. we are one collective responsible for everyone. (this is implied that yes there is a climate crisis and yes we do need to do something about it)
- I feel like theres something to tie back to euthenasia / normative ethics with kid drowning in pond and everyone having a duty to go save them (not just the first person that jumps in)
- More concretely, we can say that governments have an imperfect duty to set the foundation for individual perfect duties. They must set carbon tax laws. Ensure we have ways to measure our impact. Fairly distribute offsetting / reperation duties according to our measured impact. How they do so is not important - hence why its imperfect, but they must do so. 
- Then using this, individuals have a perfect duty to follow these rules. If the government says they must offset according to their impact, they can and should do so. 

clarifying.....
- public / private morality split creates a false dichotomy enabling mutual deflection of responsibility
	- Without infrastructure, individual action feels futile
	- Without individual compliance, infrastructure fails
	- Both governments and individuals can harm through emissions
	- Just as Marquis showed that the personhood debate in abortion ethics was a philosophical dead-end that prevented moral clarity, the public/private morality split in climate ethics similarly obscures our collective moral obligations.
- climate change is like 100 people watching a child slowly drown - it seems silly that if nobody else is going to save them then you shouldn't either (singer fair share objection). everyone has duties
- duties of goodness are toothless - we have a duty of goodness to throw recyclables in the yellow bin yet some of us don't and face no repercussions. 
- Climate emissions cause harm, therefore it's about justice not goodness
- Governments have imperfect duty of justice to create infrastructure
- Individuals have imperfect duty of justice to use that infrastructure to reduce emissions / offset their emissions / vote for these policies / parties
- These duties are symbiotic/mutually constitutive, not sequential
- Singer's proximity irrelevance applies - institutional distance doesn't matter
- We all stand at the water's edge of climate catastrophe

### **Introduction**

- Hook: Climate paralysis despite urgency
- Thesis: Public/private morality split creates false dichotomy enabling mutual deflection of responsibility
- Signposting: Will show why this split fails, establish duties of justice for both parties, demonstrate their symbiotic relationship

### **Body Paragraph 1: The False Dichotomy Problem**

- Public/private split enables mutual deflection
- Without infrastructure, individual action feels futile
- Without individual compliance, infrastructure fails
- Both can harm through emissions
- Parallel to Marquis: wrong framework obscures real moral issues

### **Body Paragraph 2: Universal Duties of Justice**

- Drowning child: 100 observers all have duties (Singer)
- Duties of goodness are toothless (recycling example)
- Climate emissions cause harm = justice issue
- Both governments and individuals harm through emissions
- Therefore both have duties of justice, not optional goodness

### **Body Paragraph 3: The Symbiotic Framework**

- Government imperfect duty: create infrastructure (carbon pricing, measurement, offsets)
- Individual imperfect duty: reduce emissions through available means AND political participation
- These are mutually constitutive, not sequential
- Singer's proximity irrelevance extends to institutional distance
- We all stand at the water's edge

### **Objection 1: The Sequential Impossibility**

- Your framework seems to require government infrastructure before individuals can act
- But governments are made of individuals - why would they create infrastructure without pre-existing duties?
- Appears to be circular/chicken-egg problem
- Response: Misunderstands the framework - both have imperfect duties of justice simultaneously
- Individuals must reduce emissions AND create political conditions for infrastructure
- Governments must build infrastructure AND respond to citizen demands
- These duties are mutually reinforcing, not sequential
- Like Singer's drowning child - everyone at the pond has immediate duties regardless of others' actions
### **Objection 2: The Collective Action Futility**

- Even with infrastructure, why comply if others don't?
- My action makes no difference either way
- Response: Singer's fair share - "others aren't helping" doesn't excuse inaction
- Drowning child parallel
- Perfect duties remain binding regardless of others' compliance
- Just deflecting to other individuals instead of government
### **Conclusion**

- Restate unified framework
- Emphasize urgency and collective responsibility
- Call to action

writing (Draft 1)....

As climate catastrophe accelerates, humanity faces a responsibility deadlock: governments await individual action while individuals demand government intervention. This mutual finger-pointing stems from an artificial division between public and private morality in climate ethics; a false dichotomy that enables mutual deflection of responsibility. This essay argues that climate change demands a unified moral framework where both governments and individuals bear imperfect duties of justice, not merely optional duties of goodness. It will demonstrate how the public/private split obscures our obligations, establish climate emissions as a matter of justice, show how governmental and individual duties form a symbiotic relationship, and finally, address two key objections.

The separation of climate ethics into public and private morality creates a destructive cycle of deflection. Individuals rightly feel their actions are futile without systemic infrastructure, while governments argue policies fail without citizen buy-in. Each sphere can thus blame the other for inaction. This dichotomy explains why Sinnott-Armstrong cannot find individual climate obligations; he searches within an isolated "private" sphere when duties are fundamentally collective (Sinnott-Armstrong, 309). This framing obscures the crucial reality that both governments and individuals directly cause climate harm. Just as Marquis reframed the abortion debate from intractable personhood arguments to the fundamental wrong of killing (Marquis, 348), the public/private split creates a similar standoff, obscuring the fundamental wrong of emissions.

Understanding our climate responsibilities requires establishing the kind of moral duty they represent. Consider our supposed duty to recycle: we ought to place cardboard in yellow bins, yet those who ignore these duties face no moral condemnation. This exemplifies how duties of goodness lack moral force. But climate change is fundamentally different. Unlike recycling, greenhouse gas emissions directly harm others through rising seas and extreme weather. As Broome argues, when individuals emit greenhouse gases, they harm others without compensation, violating the fundamental duty of justice not to harm (Broome, 306). Governments bear even greater responsibility: by permitting corporations to emit massive quantities of greenhouse gases without regulation, they enable harm on an industrial scale, violating duties of justice to protect their citizens and the global community. Singer's principle reinforces this universal obligation: if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it (Singer, 231). Both governments and individuals possess this power to prevent climate harms, making both bearers of duties of justice, not merely optional goodness.

Having established that both governments and individuals bear duties of justice, we must now examine how these obligations function in unison. Governments bear a foundational imperfect duty of justice to create the systemic infrastructure required to combat climate harm. This duty is imperfect because governments retain flexibility in their method, choosing between mechanisms like carbon pricing that internalises costs, measurement systems that track emissions, or regulated offset markets. The individual's duty, in turn, is dynamic and twofold. Initially, individuals have a general imperfect duty to reduce personal emissions where feasible and, crucially, to advocate for the very state-level infrastructure they need. However, once a government discharges its duty by implementing a specific, measurable rule; such as a law requiring citizens to offset their calculated emissions, the individual's obligation transforms. The duty to follow that specific rule becomes a perfect duty: there is no longer flexibility, as the moral requirement is to perform the precise action mandated. This framework reveals a truly symbiotic process: the government’s imperfect duty to create a system enables the individual’s perfect duty to act within it, forging a functional chain of moral responsibility.

A potential objection to this symbiotic framework is that it presents a "chicken-and-egg" problem, creating a deadlock. If individuals cannot act meaningfully without infrastructure, and governments will not build infrastructure without a popular mandate, who acts first? This objection misinterprets the starting point of moral obligation. An imperfect duty of justice does not wait for a perfect system to become binding. Instead, individuals have an immediate duty to act precisely because the system is flawed. This individual action is not merely personal virtue; it is the essential precursor to systemic change. By voting, advocating, and shifting social norms, individuals build the political will that makes it possible, and eventually necessary, for governments to discharge their own duty. Far from being a sequential problem, the duties form a continuous feedback loop: individual action creates the mandate for government policy, and that policy, in turn, enables more effective individual action.

A second objection claims that even with perfect infrastructure, individual compliance remains irrational. This objection invokes the classic collective action problem: an individual's action seems causally impotent and therefore irrational, regardless of whether others are complying or not. Why act when my individual contribution makes no difference? This resurrects the deflection Singer addresses when he asks: "Should I consider that I am less obliged to pull the drowning child out of the pond if on looking around I see other people, no further away than I am, who have also noticed the child but are doing nothing?" (Singer, 233). The moral duty exists regardless of others' actions. This objection merely deflects to other individuals instead of government. Once infrastructure quantifies an individual's contribution to harm and provides a tractable means to address it, the duty to use that means becomes binding. 

The climate crisis demands we abandon the false dichotomy of public versus private morality. Both governments and individuals bear interdependent imperfect duties of justice, not optional goodness. Neither can discharge these obligations in isolation; only through recognising a unified moral framework can we escape the paralysis of mutual deflection. As temperatures rise and seas advance, we find ourselves ever closer to the water's edge. The child is drowning now.
