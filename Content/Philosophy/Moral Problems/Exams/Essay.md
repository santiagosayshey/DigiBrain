In our daily lives, we frequently make and rely on promises, yet circumstances sometimes lead us to question whether breaking them can be justified. Act utilitarianism offers a clear framework for evaluating such dilemmas by assessing which actions produce the greatest overall happiness or good for all affected parties. Using this ethical approach, I will argue that Sam's breaking of his promise to donate Dan's fortune to a jockey club was morally permissible because it maximized overall utility, while Bob's breaking of his promise to repay Amy was morally impermissible because it failed to produce the greatest balance of good over harm when all consequences are considered.

In the first case, Sam breaks his deathbed promise to Dan in order to redirect Dan's fortune from a jockey club to a children's hospital. From a utilitarian standpoint, we must consider the happiness and suffering of all affected parties. The children who would receive medical care would likely experience significant benefits—potentially including saved lives, reduced suffering, and improved health outcomes. These benefits would extend to the children's families, who would experience relief and happiness from their children's treatment. While the jockey club would lose potential funding, this loss would be distributed among many members and would likely result in comparatively minor decreases in happiness. Dan, being deceased, can no longer experience happiness or suffering, so while his wishes are being contravened, he cannot be directly harmed by this action in the utilitarian calculus.

When we aggregate these consequences, the health and potentially life-saving benefits to numerous children and their families clearly outweigh the disappointment to jockey club members. The utilitarian principle of producing the greatest happiness for the greatest number strongly supports Sam's decision to redirect the funds. Therefore, breaking the promise was morally permissible.

An objection might be raised that breaking promises undermines social trust, which has significant negative utility. If everyone felt free to break promises whenever they believed better consequences would result, the institution of promise-keeping would collapse, causing widespread uncertainty and anxiety. This would be particularly concerning for deathbed promises, as people might lose confidence that their final wishes would be respected, causing distress during their final moments.

In response, I would argue that the utility calculation must include the specific context of this promise. First, the magnitude of good achieved through the children's hospital is exceptionally large—potentially saving many lives and alleviating significant suffering. Second, this represents a special case where the promise-maker is deceased and unable to experience harm. Third, the decision need not be widely publicized in a way that undermines general trust in promises. While there is some merit to concerns about the social institution of promise-keeping, the extraordinary good achieved in this specific case outweighs these concerns, particularly if Sam handles the situation discreetly and with respect for Dan's memory.

Turning to the second case, Bob breaks his promise to repay Amy by the end of May, choosing instead to use the money to buy his daughter a concert ticket. A utilitarian analysis must consider both immediate and longer-term consequences. In the short term, Bob's daughter would experience happiness from attending the concert. However, Amy would experience disappointment and potentially financial hardship from not receiving the expected repayment. The relationship between Bob and Amy would likely be damaged, reducing future happiness for both.

More importantly, Bob's action would have broader negative consequences. Trust between friends would be undermined, and Amy might be less willing to help others in the future, reducing overall social utility. Bob's daughter might learn that promises can be broken for personal pleasure, potentially encouraging future behavior that would reduce social trust. Additionally, Bob had alternatives available—he could have found other ways to finance the concert ticket or explained the situation to Amy and requested an extension before the deadline.

When all these factors are considered, the balance of happiness over unhappiness favors keeping the promise. The temporary joy of attending a concert does not outweigh the combination of Amy's disappointment, potential financial hardship, damaged friendship, and the broader erosion of social trust. Therefore, Bob's breaking of his promise was not morally permissible from a utilitarian perspective.

One might object that Bob's special obligation to his daughter's happiness should carry more weight in the utilitarian calculation. A parent has a unique responsibility to promote their child's wellbeing, and the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a favorite band might create memories and happiness that persist far longer than the temporary inconvenience to Amy from receiving payment a month late.

In response, I would argue that this objection overlooks several key points. First, Bob could have respected both his obligation to his daughter and his promise to Amy by seeking alternative funding sources for the concert ticket. Second, the example of integrity Bob would set for his daughter by honoring his commitments has significant positive utility for her moral development. Third, Bob unilaterally decided to delay payment without Amy's consent, showing disrespect for her autonomy and potentially causing her unforeseen financial difficulties. The apparent ease with which Bob rationalized breaking his promise ("what's the harm in paying her back in June?") suggests a dangerous slippery slope that could justify many future promise-breaking behaviors with significant negative utility.

Through this utilitarian analysis, we can see that while both cases involve broken promises, their moral permissibility differs based on the balance of good over harm they produce. Sam's action creates substantially more good than harm by redirecting funds to save children's lives, while Bob's action fails to maximize utility when all its consequences are considered. This demonstrates that utilitarianism provides a nuanced framework for moral evaluation that can distinguish between superficially similar cases based on their actual outcomes.
