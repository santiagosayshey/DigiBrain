# Promise-Breaking Through a Utilitarian Lens

Promises establish trust in human relationships, yet certain situations challenge our commitment to keeping them when greater good might result from breaking them. Act utilitarianism provides a framework for moral evaluation by determining which actions produce the greatest overall happiness for all affected parties. **Using this ethical approach, I will argue that Sam's breaking of his promise to donate Dan's fortune to a children's hospital was morally permissible because it maximized overall utility, while Bob's breaking of his promise to repay Amy was morally impermissible because it failed to produce the greatest balance of good over harm.** _First, I will analyze Sam's case and defend its moral permissibility, then address an objection regarding social trust. Next, I will examine Bob's case, concluding his action was unjustified, before responding to an objection about familial obligations._

The utilitarian calculation strongly supports Sam's decision to redirect Dan's fortune to the children's hospital rather than the jockey club. When evaluating all affected parties, the benefits overwhelmingly favor breaking the promise: many children receive potentially life-saving medical care, their families experience relief from suffering, while jockey club members experience only minor distributed disappointments. Dan, being deceased, cannot experience harm from having his wishes contravened. The substantial health benefits to numerous vulnerable children clearly outweigh the relatively minor disappointment to jockey club members, creating a greater balance of happiness over suffering. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Sam's breaking of his promise was morally permissible.

An important objection arises from considering how widespread promise-breaking might undermine valuable social institutions that create long-term utility. If everyone felt free to break promises whenever they personally judged better outcomes would result, the institution of promise-keeping would collapse, causing widespread uncertainty and anxiety. This would particularly damage trust in posthumous wishes, potentially causing distress to the dying and undermining estate planning. According to this objection, the rule utilitarian might argue that following rules against promise-breaking produces better outcomes in the long run than evaluating each case individually.

This objection, while significant, fails to account for the exceptional nature of Sam's situation. The extraordinary magnitude of good achieved through redirecting funds to save children's lives represents a rare circumstance rather than an everyday calculation. Unlike typical promises, this case involves a deceased promise-maker who cannot experience direct harm. Furthermore, Sam can implement his decision discreetly to minimize institutional damage. When promises conflict with substantial human welfare, utilitarianism permits exceptions in extraordinary cases without undermining the general practice of promise-keeping. The utility gained from saving many children's lives justifies this particular exception.

Unlike Sam's case, Bob's breaking of his promise to repay Amy fails the utilitarian test because the benefits are clearly outweighed by multiple harms. The temporary happiness Bob's daughter gains from attending a concert cannot justify the combined negative consequences: Amy's disappointment and potential financial hardship, damage to their friendship, undermining of trust between friends, and teaching his daughter that promises can be broken for personal pleasure. Bob's situation presents only modest benefits against significant harms, unlike Sam's case where substantial welfare improvements justified an exception to promise-keeping. Therefore, from a utilitarian standpoint, Bob's breaking of his promise was not morally permissible.

One might object that parental obligations to promote a child's happiness carry special weight in utilitarian calculations. This objection argues that a parent's unique responsibility to their child's wellbeing suggests the once-in-a-lifetime concert opportunity creates lasting memories and happiness that outweigh the temporary inconvenience to Amy from delayed payment. According to this view, this special relationship might justify prioritizing the daughter's interests over strict adherence to the promised repayment timeline, making Bob's action potentially permissible under utilitarianism.

This objection fails because it overlooks readily available alternatives that would satisfy both of Bob's obligations without requiring promise-breaking. Bob could have fulfilled both obligations by seeking alternative funding for the ticket, such as borrowing from another friend or finding temporary work. Moreover, teaching his daughter about integrity and promise-keeping through example has significant positive utility for her moral development. Finally, unilaterally changing agreement terms without Amy's consent disrespects her autonomy and potentially causes unforeseen financial difficulties. Bob's failure to explore these alternatives demonstrates flawed utilitarian reasoning and confirms the impermissibility of his action.

Through careful utilitarian analysis, we can distinguish between superficially similar promise-breaking cases based on their actual outcomes. While both cases involve broken promises, their moral permissibility differs based on the balance of good over harm they produce. Sam's action creates substantially more good than harm by redirecting funds to save children's lives, while Bob's action fails to maximize utility when all consequences are considered. This demonstrates that utilitarianism provides a nuanced framework for moral evaluation that can make principled distinctions between different cases of promise-breaking based on their consequences for human welfare.gy
