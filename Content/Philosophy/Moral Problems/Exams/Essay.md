# The Utility of Promises: A Utilitarian Analysis

Promises serve as the foundation of trust in human relationships, yet we sometimes face situations where breaking them might seem justified by the outcomes. Act utilitarianism evaluates moral actions based on which produces the greatest overall happiness or good for all affected parties. **Using this ethical approach, I will argue that Sam's breaking of his promise to donate Dan's fortune to a children's hospital was morally permissible because it maximized overall utility, while Bob's breaking of his promise to repay Amy was morally impermissible because it failed to produce the greatest balance of good over harm.** _First, I will analyze Sam's case and defend its moral permissibility, then address an objection regarding social trust. Next, I will examine Bob's case, concluding his action was unjustified, before responding to an objection about familial obligations._

**Sam's redirection of Dan's fortune to the children's hospital maximizes utility through the substantial good it creates.** The utilitarian calculation must weigh the benefits to all parties involved: children receiving medical care gain potentially life-saving treatment, their families experience relief from suffering, while the jockey club members suffer only distributed minor disappointments. Dan, being deceased, cannot experience harm from his wishes being contravened. When aggregating these consequences, the significant health benefits to numerous vulnerable children clearly outweigh the relatively minor disappointment to jockey club members. The life-saving potential of medical care provides a compelling utilitarian justification for breaking this particular promise.

**Breaking promises, even for good outcomes, potentially undermines valuable social institutions that create long-term utility.** If promise-breaking became widespread, the institution of promise-keeping would collapse, causing uncertainty and anxiety. This would particularly damage trust in posthumous wishes, potentially causing distress to the dying and undermining estate planning. The rule utilitarian might argue that following rules against promise-breaking produces better outcomes in the long run than evaluating each case individually.

**The extraordinary magnitude of good in Sam's case justifies an exception to general promise-keeping without threatening the broader social institution.** The utility calculation must consider several mitigating factors: first, the exceptional good achieved through saving children's lives represents an unusual circumstance rather than an everyday calculation; second, the promise-maker cannot experience direct harm; third, Sam can implement his decision discreetly to minimize institutional damage. When promises conflict with substantial human welfare, utilitarianism permits exceptions without undermining the general practice of promise-keeping.

**Bob's promise-breaking fails to maximize utility because the limited benefits are outweighed by multiple harms.** The temporary happiness Bob's daughter gains from attending a concert cannot outweigh the combined negative consequences: Amy's disappointment and potential financial hardship, damage to their friendship, undermining trust between friends, and teaching his daughter that promises can be broken for personal pleasure. Unlike Sam's case, where substantial welfare improvements justified an exception to promise-keeping, Bob's situation presents only modest benefits against significant harms.

**Parental obligations to promote a child's happiness might carry special weight in utilitarian calculations, potentially justifying promise-breaking in certain cases.** A parent's unique responsibility to their child's wellbeing could suggest that the once-in-a-lifetime concert opportunity creates lasting memories and happiness that outweigh the temporary inconvenience to Amy from delayed payment. This special relationship might justify prioritizing the daughter's interests over strict adherence to the promised repayment timeline.

**The apparent conflict between Bob's obligations masks readily available alternatives that would satisfy both duties without requiring promise-breaking.** This objection fails for three reasons: first, Bob could have fulfilled both obligations by seeking alternative funding for the ticket; second, teaching his daughter about integrity and promise-keeping has significant positive utility for her moral development; third, unilaterally changing agreement terms without Amy's consent disrespects her autonomy and potentially causes unforeseen financial difficulties. Bob's failure to explore these alternatives before breaking his promise demonstrates flawed utilitarian reasoning.

**Utilitarian analysis reveals crucial distinctions between superficially similar promise-breaking cases based on their actual outcomes.** While both cases involve broken promises, their moral permissibility differs based on the balance of good over harm they produce. Sam's action creates substantially more good than harm by redirecting funds to save children's lives, while Bob's action fails to maximize utility when all consequences are considered. This demonstrates that utilitarianism provides a nuanced framework that can distinguish between cases based on their real-world impacts rather than rigid rules.
