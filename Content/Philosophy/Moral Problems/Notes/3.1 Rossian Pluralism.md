> [!motivation] Limitations of Traditional Moral Theories
> 
> Ethical dilemmas expose gaps in major moral frameworks. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing good outcomes, disregarding the independent value of principles like promise-keeping or justice. Kantian ethics emphasizes rigid moral rules that cannot be broken regardless of consequences. Neither approach adequately handles situations where multiple moral considerations conflict. **How can we account for both the importance of consequences and the value of different moral principles?**

> [!idea] Ross's Moral Pluralism
> 
> W.D. Ross rejected both Kantian absolutism and utilitarian monism in favor of moral pluralism:
> 
> - Moral reality is inherently complex and cannot be reduced to a single principle
> - No single moral theory (like utilitarianism or Kantianism) can capture all morally relevant considerations
> - Different moral principles capture different aspects of our moral intuitions
> - Some actions possess "rightness" or "wrongness" independent of their consequences
> - Our moral experience reveals multiple, irreducible sources of moral obligation
> - Morality is fundamentally pluralistic rather than monistic
> 
> Ross believed that careful reflection on our considered moral judgments reveals a plurality of **basic moral principles that cannot be derived from or reduced to one another.**

> [!idea] Prima Facie Duties
> 
> Ross proposed prima facie duties as the core of his pluralistic ethical theory:
> 
> - These are **moral obligations that always matter but can be overridden when they conflict**
> - "Prima facie" means they are genuine obligations at first glance, not merely apparent ones
> - When no conflict exists, a prima facie duty becomes our actual duty in that situation
> - The main prima facie duties include:
>     - **Fidelity**: Keeping promises and being truthful
>     - **Reparation**: Making amends for past wrongs
>     - **Gratitude**: Expressing thanks for benefits received
>     - **Non-maleficence**: Not harming others
>     - **Beneficence**: Helping others when possible
>     - **Justice**: Distributing benefits and burdens fairly
>     - **Self-improvement**: Developing one's talents and knowledge
> 
> When duties conflict, we determine our "all-things-considered duty" by weighing which duty is most important in that specific context, using our moral intuition and judgment rather than applying a predetermined formula or hierarchy.
> 1. Determine all relevant prima facie duties
> 2. Weigh them against each other and determine which one is weightiest
> 3. Satisfy the weightiest duty
> 
> This approach accommodates the complexity of moral life better than absolute rules or pure consequentialism, respecting both principle-based ethics and the importance of outcomes in our moral reasoning.

> [!consider] Are Prima Facie Duties Self-Evident?
> 
> Ross claims prima facie duties are **self-evident** moral truths we know directly without further justification:
> 
> - These duties aren't derived from higher principles but represent distinct, irreducible moral considerations
> - We grasp them through moral intuition, similar to recognizing basic logical truths
> - Ross sees them as objective and universal, though their relative importance varies by situation
> - While the general principles are self-evident, their application in complex cases requires judgment
> 
> This reliance on self-evidence captures our intuition that certain moral considerations matter inherently, not just for their consequences, but raises questions about how to resolve conflicts between duties.

> [!consider] What Does "Prima Facie Duty" Really Mean?
> 
> Ross himself acknowledges the term "prima facie duty" is problematic:
> 
> - It's **not actually a type of duty** at all, but something related to duty in a specific way
> - It doesn't mean "apparent at first glance" but rather an **objective moral consideration**
> - It represents a moral feature that would constitute a full duty if it were the only morally relevant feature present
> 
> A better understanding might be:
> 
> - **Moral consideration** - A feature of a situation that creates a genuine moral reason to act in a certain way
> - **Pro tanto reason** - A reason that genuinely matters but can be outweighed (many philosophers now use this term instead)
> - **Standing moral requirement** - Always relevant but not always decisive
> 
> When Ross says a prima facie duty is "an objective fact involved in the nature of the situation, or more strictly in an element of its nature," he means these considerations exist objectively in the moral landscape, not just in our perceptions. Unlike full duties, which arise from the complete situation, prima facie duties arise from particular aspects of situations (promises, relationships, potential harms) that create genuine but potentially overridable moral claims on us.

> [!idea] Moore's Ideal Utilitarianism
> 
> Moore's ethical theory represents a sophisticated evolution of utilitarian thinking:
> 
> - **Single Moral Principle**: Right actions are those that produce more good than any alternative
> - **Pluralistic Value Theory**: Unlike hedonistic utilitarianism, Moore recognizes multiple intrinsic goods beyond pleasure:
>     - Knowledge and understanding
>     - Virtue and good character
>     - Beauty and aesthetic experience
> - **Consequentialist Framework**: Still evaluates actions solely by their outcomes
> - **Impartial Maximization**: The identity of who receives the good (self, promisee, benefactor) is morally irrelevant
> 
> Moore retains the elegant simplicity of utilitarianism's single criterion while expanding what counts as "good," creating a theory that avoids hedonism's reductionism while maintaining a straightforward decision procedure.

> [!consider] Ross's Challenge to Moore Through Prima Facie Duties
> 
> Ross challenges Moore's theory by exposing several fundamental problems:
> 
> - **The Personal Character of Duty**: Moore's theory "ignores the highly personal character of duty"
>     - Does it really make "no difference" morally whether the good goes to someone to whom we've made a promise versus a stranger?
>     - Our moral intuitions strongly suggest that relationships matter intrinsically
> - **The Problem of Promise-Keeping**: Ross's decisive counterexample:
>     - If we could produce equal amounts of good by either keeping a promise or helping a stranger, Moore's theory provides no basis for choosing
>     - Yet most people would clearly feel obligated to keep the promise
> - **Multiple Sources of Rightness**: Ross argues rightness doesn't come from a single source
>     - "Why should two sets of circumstances not possess different characteristics, any one of which makes a certain act our prima facie duty?"
>     - The rightness of keeping promises can't be reduced to producing good consequences
> - **Simplicity vs. Reality**: Moore's theory achieves theoretical simplicity by ignoring moral complexity
>     - "It is more important that our theory fit the facts than that it be simple"
>     - Moore "simplifies unduly our relations to our fellows" by reducing them to "possible beneficiaries"
> 
> Ross shows that Moore's theory, despite its elegance, fails to capture essential features of our moral experience and thinking.
