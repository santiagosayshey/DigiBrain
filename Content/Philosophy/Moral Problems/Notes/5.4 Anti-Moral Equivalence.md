> [!motivation] Anti-Moral Equivalence
> 
> Rachels' Moral Equivalence Argument claims there is no intrinsic moral difference between killing and letting die, structured as:
> 
> - P1: If there is a morally relevant difference between active and passive euthanasia, then there is a morally relevant difference between killing and letting die
> - P2: There is not a morally relevant difference between killing and letting die
> - C: There is not a morally relevant difference between active and passive euthanasia
> 
> But what if we reject P1? This premise assumes that the moral status of euthanasia derives exclusively from the killing/letting die distinction.
> 
> Challenging this premise opens new possibilities:
> 
> - Active and passive euthanasia might differ morally for reasons beyond the killing/letting die distinction
> - Additional factors specific to medical contexts might create morally relevant differences

> [!idea] Anti-Moral Equivalence: Rejecting Moral Equality of Killing and Letting Die
> 
> Anti-Moral Equivalence is the position that killing and letting die are not morally equivalent actions. This view directly opposes Rachels' Equivalence Thesis.
> 
> **Foundational Claim**:
> 
> - Killing is morally worse than letting die, even when circumstances and motives are similar
> - The act/omission distinction carries intrinsic moral significance
> 
> This position is supported by two key arguments:
> 
> **Slippery Slope Concerns**:
> 
> - Permitting active euthanasia risks eroding prohibitions against killing
> - Initial acceptance in limited cases may lead to expansion to non-terminal patients
> - Social and psychological barriers against killing serve protective functions
> 
> **Rule Utilitarian Framework**:
> 
> - Rules against killing produce better societal outcomes than case-by-case judgments
> - The prohibition against killing serves as a fundamental moral boundary
> - Social utility is maximized by preserving clear boundaries between killing and letting die
> - If we had a law to allow _some_ AE, then we go back to the slippery slope concern
> 
> **Logical structure** (Modus Tollens):
> 
> - P1: If an act is morally permissible, then it is allowed by an optimific (produces the best overall consequences for society) social rule or law
> - P2: Active euthanasia is not allowed by an optimific social rule or law
> - C: Therefore, active euthanasia is not morally permissible
> 
> These arguments suggest that maintaining the moral distinction between active and passive euthanasia serves important social functions.

> [!consider] Slippery Slope Argument
> 
> A slippery slope argument **claims that allowing one action will lead to a chain of events culminating in an undesirable outcome**.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> 
> - Initial seemingly acceptable step
> - Series of intermediate steps
> - Unacceptable final outcome
> - Causal mechanism connecting the steps
> 
> **Structure**:
> 
> - P1: If A is allowed, B will follow
> - P2: If B occurs, C will follow
> - P3: C is morally unacceptable
> - C: Therefore, we should not allow A
> 
> **Application to Active Euthanasia**:
> 
> - Step 1: Allow active euthanasia for consenting terminally ill patients
> - Step 2: Extend to non-terminal patients with chronic suffering
> - Step 3: Permit for those unable to consent (comatose, mentally impaired)
> - Step 4: Apply to those deemed burdens on healthcare resources
> - Final outcome: Involuntary euthanasia of vulnerable populations
> 
> Critics argue this reasoning confuses possibility with inevitability and ignores that clear boundaries can be maintained.

> [!example] Eroding the Principle Against Killing
> 
> The slippery slope argument shows how legalizing active euthanasia could gradually undermine our general principle against killing:
> 
> **Progression**:
> 
> - Active euthanasia is legalized for terminally ill patients with unbearable suffering
> - The principle "doctors must not kill" is replaced with "doctors may kill in extreme circumstances"
> - This weakened principle is then challenged: Why only terminal illness? What about chronic suffering?
> - The boundary shifts to allow active euthanasia for non-terminal conditions with severe suffering
> - The requirement for patient consent is questioned in cases where patients cannot express wishes
> - Eventually, quality-of-life judgments by others could determine who receives euthanasia (criminals? defective newborns? severely mentally disabled?)
> 
> This demonstrates how a once-firm principle against killing can be gradually eroded once exceptions are permitted, supporting Beauchamp's concern about maintaining the distinction between active and passive approaches. **Voluntary euthanasia may erode into involuntary euthanasia**.

> [!consider] The Morally Permitted Killing Objection
> 
> Critics point out that our **society already permits certain forms of killing, challenging the Anti-Moral Equivalence position.**
> 
> **Common Exceptions to the Prohibition Against Killing**:
> 
> - Self-defense: Killing to protect oneself from immediate threat
> - Just wars: Sanctioned killing of enemy combatants
> - Capital punishment: State-authorized execution of criminals
> 
> **Beauchamp's Response**:
> 
> - These exceptions involve fundamentally different contexts and actors
> - Military and self-defense involve immediate threats, not helpless patients
> - Medical professionals have a distinct social role as healers, not soldiers or executioners
> - The medical context carries unique concerns about doctor-patient trust
> 
> This response suggests the prohibition against medical killing serves a particular social function that remains important even while other exceptions to the general rule against killing exist.

> [!consider] The Prediction Objection to Slippery Slopes
> 
> Critics challenge the slippery slope argument by q**uestioning its predictive validity.**
> 
> **Core Objection**:
> 
> - What evidence supports the claim that erosion of respect for human life will occur?
> - Many predicted slippery slopes never materialize
> - Strict regulations and boundaries could prevent expansion
> 
> **Beauchamp's Response**:
> 
> - The mere possibility of erosion justifies caution
> - Maintaining established boundaries is safer than creating new ones
> - The psychological barrier against medical killing serves a protective function
> - Once crossed, this boundary is difficult to re-establish
> - Upholding existing prohibitions that already protect patients is prudent
> 
> This response emphasizes that even if slippery slope predictions are uncertain, the principle of preserving established protective boundaries has independent value.
