> [!motivation] Anti-Moral Equivalence
> 
> Rachels' Moral Equivalence Argument claims there is no intrinsic moral difference between killing and letting die, structured as:
> 
> - P1: If there is a morally relevant difference between active and passive euthanasia, then there is a morally relevant difference between killing and letting die
> - P2: There is not a morally relevant difference between killing and letting die
> - C: There is not a morally relevant difference between active and passive euthanasia
> 
> But what if we reject P1? This premise assumes that the moral status of euthanasia derives exclusively from the killing/letting die distinction.
> 
> Challenging this premise opens new possibilities:
> 
> - Active and passive euthanasia might differ morally for reasons beyond the killing/letting die distinction
> - Additional factors specific to medical contexts might create morally relevant differences

> [!consider] Anti-Moral Equivalence: Rejecting Moral Equality of Killing and Letting Die
> 
> Anti-Moral Equivalence is the position that killing and letting die are not morally equivalent actions. This view directly opposes Rachels' Equivalence Thesis.
> 
> **Foundational Claim**:
> 
> - Killing is morally worse than letting die, even when circumstances and motives are similar
> - The act/omission distinction carries intrinsic moral significance
> 
> This position is supported by two key arguments:
> 
> **Slippery Slope Concerns**:
> 
> - Permitting active euthanasia risks eroding prohibitions against killing
> - Initial acceptance in limited cases may lead to expansion to non-terminal patients
> - Social and psychological barriers against killing serve protective functions
> 
> **Rule Utilitarian Framework**:
> 
> - Rules against killing produce better societal outcomes than case-by-case judgments
> - The prohibition against killing serves as a fundamental moral boundary
> - Social utility is maximized by preserving clear boundaries between killing and letting die
> 
> These arguments suggest that maintaining the moral distinction between active and passive euthanasia serves important social functions.

> [!idea] Slippery Slope Argument
> 
> A slippery slope argument **claims that allowing one action will lead to a chain of events culminating in an undesirable outcome**.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> 
> - Initial seemingly acceptable step
> - Series of intermediate steps
> - Unacceptable final outcome
> - Causal mechanism connecting the steps
> 
> **Structure**:
> 
> - P1: If A is allowed, B will follow
> - P2: If B occurs, C will follow
> - P3: C is morally unacceptable
> - C: Therefore, we should not allow A
> 
> **Application to Active Euthanasia**:
> 
> - Step 1: Allow active euthanasia for consenting terminally ill patients
> - Step 2: Extend to non-terminal patients with chronic suffering
> - Step 3: Permit for those unable to consent (comatose, mentally impaired)
> - Step 4: Apply to those deemed burdens on healthcare resources
> - Final outcome: Involuntary euthanasia of vulnerable populations
> 
> Critics argue this reasoning confuses possibility with inevitability and ignores that clear boundaries can be maintained.

> [!example] Eroding the Principle Against Killing
> 
> The slippery slope argument shows how legalizing active euthanasia could gradually undermine our general principle against killing:
> 
> **Progression**:
> 
> - Active euthanasia is legalized for terminally ill patients with unbearable suffering
> - The principle "doctors must not kill" is replaced with "doctors may kill in extreme circumstances"
> - This weakened principle is then challenged: Why only terminal illness? What about chronic suffering?
> - The boundary shifts to allow active euthanasia for non-terminal conditions with severe suffering
> - The requirement for patient consent is questioned in cases where patients cannot express wishes
> - Eventually, quality-of-life judgments by others could determine who receives euthanasia
> 
> This demonstrates how a once-firm principle against killing can be gradually eroded once exceptions are permitted, supporting Beauchamp's concern about maintaining the distinction between active and passive approaches.
