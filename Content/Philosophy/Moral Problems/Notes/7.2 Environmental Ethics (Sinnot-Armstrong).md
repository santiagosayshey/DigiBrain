> [!motivation] Do Individuals have Duties of Justice?
> 
> While we've established that climate change presents serious ethical challenges, a fundamental question remains: Do individuals actually have direct duties of justice regarding climate change?
> - Is each person morally obligated to take personal actions to reduce their carbon footprint?
> - Or might our responsibilities lie elsewhere?
> 
> This question challenges us to examine the relationship between individual actions, collective problems, and the proper allocation of moral responsibility.

> [!idea] Armstrong's View
> 
> Sinnot-Armstrong argues that individuals do **not** have direct duties of justice regarding climate change. However, they do have duties to prompt their governments to take action for everyone.
> 
> This view rests on 8 key assumptions:
> - **Climate Reality**: Global warming has started and is worsening
> - **Human Causation**: The primary cause is human action, particularly fossil fuel consumption
> - **Future Harm**: It will lead to serious problems for many people over the long term
> - **Disproportionate Impact**: The poor will suffer the most severe consequences
> - **Governmental Capacity**: Governments (especially wealthy nations) have the ability to mitigate global warming
> - **Limited Window**: It is too late to stop climate change entirely
> - **High Mitigation Cost**: Steps to slow down or reduce severity will be extremely costly (contrary to Broome's view that mitigation is relatively inexpensive)
> - **Moral Imperative**: Despite these costs, governments (especially the USA) still ought to take action

> [!consider] Obligations
> 
> The relationship between collective and individual obligations is complex:
> 
> **Key Principle**: Individual obligations do not automatically follow from collective ones.
> - Governmental duties don't necessarily create corresponding individual duties
> - However, sometimes individual duties do emerge from collective responsibilities
> 
> **Determining Factors**:
> - The nature of the problem (scale, complexity, coordination requirements)
> - Efficacy of individual action
> - Institutional roles and responsibilities
> - Potential harm from uncoordinated individual efforts
> 
> This framework raises questions about what exactly individuals can do regarding climate change, and more importantly, what they ought to do.

> [!example] Safe Bridges
> 
> Consider a scenario involving dangerous bridges in a community:
> 
> **Scenario**:
> - The government has a clear duty to repair dangerous bridges for public safety
> - These bridges pose a significant risk to citizens if left unrepaired
> 
> **Individual Obligation Analysis**:
> - Even if you as an individual had the technical capability and resources to repair a bridge, you would not have a moral obligation to do so
> - Reasons include:
>   - Bridge repair requires coordination and standards
>   - Individual action might interfere with systematic solutions
>   - The responsibility properly belongs to the designated institution
> 
> This example illustrates how some collective obligations don't translate to individual duties, even when the stakes are high.

> [!example] Teaching Arithmetic
> 
> Consider education as a contrasting example:
> 
> **Scenario**:
> - Governments have a duty to provide basic education to children
> - This includes teaching fundamental arithmetic skills
> 
> **Individual Obligation Analysis**:
> - If the government fails to teach your children arithmetic, you would typically need to step in
> - Options might include:
>   - Teaching them yourself
>   - Hiring a tutor
>   - Finding alternative educational resources
> 
> **Why This Differs from Bridges**:
> - The need is immediate and directly affects dependents in your care
> - Individual action is feasible and effective
> - The harm from inaction is significant and falls primarily on those you're responsible for
> 
> This example demonstrates that some collective failures do create individual moral obligations.
