## 1. Objective: Create Clear, Modular Notes

Hello! Let's create some notes on the topic specified below.

- **Topic for Notes:** `[Environmental Ethics (Sinnot-Armstrong)]`

I need these notes to be:

- **Concise & Modular:** Easy to digest in distinct blocks.
- **Focused on Key Ideas:** Highlight the core concepts for understanding.
- **Synthesized:** Please process and explain the information, not just copy text from sources.
- **Formatted with Callouts:** Structure the entire output using the 'callout' blocks defined below.

**Do not** provide a preliminary outline or introduction. Generate the final formatted note directly.

## 2. Callout Formatting Guide

Structure the notes using 'callout' blocks. Each block starts with `>` on every line, with the first line defining the type and title:

Markdown

```
> [!callout_type] Title of Callout
>
> Content for the callout goes here.
> - Bullet points can be used for lists.
> Further explanations or details.
```

- **Titles:** Keep titles informative and brief (e.g., `Kruskal's Algorithm`, `Network Cost Problem`). Avoid generic placeholders like `Main Idea Here`.
- **Content:** Tailor the content within each callout based on its defined purpose (see section 3).

## 3. Callout Type Definitions

Here are the available callout types. Use them as appropriate for the content. The descriptions clarify the intended _purpose_ of each type:

### `> [!motivation] Motivation`

- **Purpose**: Sets the context. Introduce the problem, need, or scenario that the main topic addresses. _Do not include the solution itself here._
- **Elements**: Describe the challenge or situation; outline the specific issues needing resolution.
- **Example (MST Context)**: Minimizing cost (like cable length) when connecting multiple points in a network, while ensuring full connectivity, presents a common optimization challenge.

### `> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept`

- **Purpose**: Explains the core solution, definition, or algorithm.
- **Elements**: Clearly define the concept; describe how it works; link it back to solving the problem stated in the motivation.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Kruskal's Algorithm identifies a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in weighted, undirected graphs. It greedily adds the lowest-weight edge available that doesn't create a cycle, continuing until all vertices are connected.

### `> [!example] Example or Illustration`

- **Purpose**: Provides a concrete demonstration of the idea in action.
- **Elements**: Show a specific case, walk through steps, use diagrams (described), or illustrate the outcome. Explain _how_ the example demonstrates the concept.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Given a graph, Kruskal's first sorts edges by weight. It then adds edges like AB (weight 1), CD (weight 2), AC (weight 3), skipping edges like BD (weight 4) if adding it would form a cycle, until an MST is formed.

### `> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas`

- **Purpose**: Adds depth by exploring related topics, nuances, limitations, or advanced aspects.
- **Elements**: Discuss broader implications, related theories, implementation details (like data structures), edge cases, or variations.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Cycle detection in Kruskal's is often efficiently handled by a Union-Find data structure. The algorithm's time complexity is typically influenced by edge sorting and Union-Find operations (O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)). Consider Prim's algorithm as an alternative MST approach.

### `> [!summary] Summary of Key Concepts`

- **Purpose**: Briefly recap main points from previous callouts. **Only use when specifically requested.**
- **Format**: Use bullet points. Start each point with the **bolded topic** followed by a 1-2 sentence summary. Focus on _what_ the concepts are.
- **Good Example**:
    - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: A subset of edges connecting all vertices in a graph with the minimum possible total weight without cycles.
    - **Greedy Algorithm**: An approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each step; Kruskal's is an example.
- **Avoid**: Summarizing the structure of the notes themselves (e.g., "We discussed the motivation, then the idea...").

## 4. Allowed Formatting Within Callouts

You can enhance callouts with:

- **Tables**: Use standard Markdown.
```markdown
| Algorithm | Complexity | Notes           |
| :-------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| Kruskal's | O(E log E) | Requires sorting |
| Prim's    | O(E log V) | Using Fibonacci heap |
```
    
- **Images**: Mark placement with a placeholder block. **Provide a clear description** of the desired image and use the Obsidian wikilink format `![[ImageName.png]]`.
```image-goes-here
Description: Diagram comparing the edge selection process of Kruskal's vs Prim's algorithm on the same sample graph. Kruskal's focuses on global lowest edge, Prim's grows from a starting node.
![[kruskal_vs_prim_comparison.png]]
```

- **Math**: Use LaTeX delimiters.
    - Inline: `$O(N^2)$`
    - Block:
```math
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi
$$
```
        
## 5. Specific Callout Sequence Interpretation

Check the table below. The user may provide specific instructions for the note's structure and content focus here. Your action depends on the state of this table in the user's request:

- **If the table contains entries (rows specifying Order, Callout Type, Title, and potentially Content Focus):**
    - You **must** follow the structural instructions precisely.
    - Generate the note using the exact sequence, `[!callout type]`, and `Title` provided in each row.
    - Do **not** add, remove, or reorder the callouts relative to the specified sequence.
    - It is imperative that you write **ONLY** the provided callouts and nothing more or less. 
    - Consult the **Content Focus / Notes** column for each row. If notes are provided, use them as **guidance** regarding the _information_, _key points_, or _emphasis_ the user wants within that specific callout.
    - **Important Constraint:** These notes are **high-level pointers**, _not_ prescriptive text or rigid formatting rules. They should inform the _content_ you generate but **must not dictate** your specific wording, sentence structure, or the overall objective writing style required by this prompt. Think of them as hints for _what_ to cover or emphasize, allowing you to still synthesize and formulate the explanation clearly and objectively.
    - Ensure the final content generated for each callout aligns with its specified `[!callout type]` and `Title`, while incorporating the thematic guidance from the notes column where provided and applicable.
- **If the table is empty or absent:**
    - You have the flexibility to determine the most effective sequence, types of callouts (e.g., `[!motivation]`, `[!idea]`, `[!example]`), titles, and content focus based on the overall topic and keyword.

_(The table structure below illustrates the format the user employs. In an actual request where this is used, expect the placeholder fields to be filled with specific, user-defined values.)_

| **Order** | **Callout Type** | **Title Placeholder**                  | **Content Focus / Notes (Optional Guidance)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## 6. Guiding Principles for Content & Formatting

Please apply the following principles to create clear, effective, and well-structured notes:

1.  **Objective Language:** Maintain a neutral and factual tone. Describe concepts and processes objectively, without subjective evaluations (e.g., use "Method X involves..." instead of "Method X is the best way to...").

2.  **Clarity and Necessary Detail:**
    * **Primary Goal:** Ensure the core message of each callout is clear, understandable, and contains the necessary information to be meaningful.
    * **Completeness:** Include the details essential for understanding the specific point of the callout. Don't omit crucial information for the sake of brevity.

3.  **Conciseness (Efficiency and No Fluff):**
    * **Be Economical:** While ensuring clarity (Principle #2), use the fewest words necessary to convey the information accurately.
    * **Eliminate Redundancy:** Avoid repeating points, using filler words ("in order to," "basically," "actually"), or overly elaborate sentence structures. Be direct.
    * **Focus:** Stick closely to the specific topic of the callout title. Don't include tangential information or unnecessary background.

4.  **Modularity and Focused Callouts (Segmentation):**
    * **Principle:** Structure the notes into logical, modular callouts, each generally focused on a single distinct topic, concept, step, or aspect. This aids organization and readability.
    * **When to Segment:** Consider using separate callouts for clearly distinct parts of a larger topic. For example, define a concept in one `[!idea]` and illustrate it in a separate `[!example]`, or discuss different facets of a problem in separate `[!consider]` callouts.
    * **Coherence:** Balance modularity with clarity. It's acceptable to keep closely related points together within a single callout if separating them would make the information harder to understand, provided the callout remains focused on its main theme.

5.  **Readable Internal Structure (Mix Formats):**
    * **Guideline:** To improve readability and structure *within* a callout, consider using a mix of formatting elements where it naturally fits the content. Brief paragraphs combined with focused bullet points or small tables can often be effective.
    * **Avoid Monotony:** Generally, try to avoid callouts that consist *only* of one large, unbroken block of text or *only* a very long list of bullets, as varied formatting usually helps the reader.
    * **Flexibility:** The structure should serve the content. For very short, simple points, a couple of clear sentences may be perfectly adequate without needing forced bullet points or tables. Use your judgment to make the information easy to scan and digest.
    * **Start Content on New Line:** Always begin callout content on the line *after* the `> [!type] Title` header.

6.  **Final Output Wrapper:** Enclose the **entire** final note (all callout blocks) within a single Markdown code block for accurate copying:

```markdown
> [!type] Title
> Clear, concise content...

> [!type] Another Title
> More clear, concise content...
> - Supporting point 1 (no fluff).
> - Supporting point 2 (no fluff).
```


**Checklist (Internal AI Use - Review Against Principles):**

* [ ] Language is objective?
* [ ] Content is clear and includes necessary detail for understanding?
* [ ] Content is concise, direct, and free of fluff/redundancy?
* [ ] Notes are reasonably modular, with distinct topics generally segmented?
* [ ] Internal structure enhances readability (generally avoids monotony)?
* [ ] Content starts on new line?
* [ ] Followed specific callout sequence if table provided?
* [ ] Final output fully wrapped?
