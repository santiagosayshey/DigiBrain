> [!motivation] Do Individuals have Duties of Justice?
>
> Given the reality and threats of climate change, a significant ethical question arises: Do individuals possess a direct moral obligation, rooted in principles of justice or harm prevention, to personally reduce their greenhouse gas emissions? Or does the primary responsibility lie elsewhere, such as with governments and collective entities? This exploration examines the basis and extent of individual duties concerning large-scale environmental problems like global warming.

> [!idea] Armstrong's View
>
> Walter Sinnott-Armstrong argues that individuals generally do **not** have a direct moral obligation to reduce their personal greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., by avoiding Sunday drives for pleasure). However, he contends that individuals **do** have a moral obligation to pressure their governments to implement large-scale solutions to climate change. This position rests on several key assumptions:
> 1.  Global warming is occurring and worsening.
> 2.  Human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels, are the main cause.
> 3.  Significant negative consequences will result, especially in the long term.
> 4.  These harms will disproportionately affect the world's poorest populations.
> 5.  Governments, particularly those of affluent nations, possess the capacity to mitigate climate change effectively.
> 6.  Completely halting global warming is no longer possible, but mitigation is.
> 7.  Meaningful mitigation efforts will be very expensive (contrasting with views like Broome's, who sees it as relatively cheap).
> 8.  Despite the high cost, governments (especially the U.S.) have a moral obligation to undertake these mitigation efforts.

> [!consider] Obligations

> The relationship between collective obligations (what groups or governments ought to do) and individual obligations (what each person ought to do) is complex.
> - It is not automatically true that if a collective body (like a government) has an obligation to achieve a certain outcome, then every individual member of that collective shares a corresponding personal obligation to act directly towards that outcome.
> - However, this doesn't preclude the possibility that individual obligations might arise in specific circumstances, potentially stemming from or relating to collective duties, especially if the collective fails to act. The nature and trigger for such individual obligations require careful examination in different contexts.

> [!example] Safe Bridges
>
> Consider the government's responsibility to maintain safe infrastructure, such as bridges. If a particular bridge becomes dangerously unsafe, it is generally accepted that the government has an obligation to repair or replace it. Does this mean that you, as an individual citizen, have a moral obligation to personally go out and fix the bridge, even if you happened to have the engineering skills and resources? Sinnott-Armstrong suggests the answer is typically no; the obligation rests primarily with the designated collective entity (the government).

> [!example] Teaching Arithmetic
>
> Contrast the bridge example with education. Governments generally have an obligation to provide basic education, including teaching children arithmetic. If the public school system fails significantly in this duty for your child, many would argue that you, as a parent, *do* acquire an obligation to ensure your child learns arithmetic, perhaps by teaching them yourself, hiring a tutor, or finding alternative schooling. In this case, the failure of the collective (government/school) seems to generate or activate a direct individual obligation.
