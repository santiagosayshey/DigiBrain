> [!motivation] Do Individuals have Duties of Justice?
> 
> While we've established that climate change presents serious ethical challenges, a fundamental question remains: Do individuals actually have direct duties of justice regarding climate change?
> - Is each person morally obligated to take personal actions to reduce their carbon footprint?
> - Or might our responsibilities lie elsewhere?
> 
> This question challenges us to examine the relationship between individual actions, collective problems, and the proper allocation of moral responsibility.

> [!idea] Armstrong's View
> 
> Sinnot-Armstrong argues that individuals do **not** have direct duties of justice regarding climate change. However, they do have duties to prompt their governments to take action for everyone.
> 
> This view rests on 8 key assumptions:
> - **Climate Reality**: Global warming has started and is worsening
> - **Human Causation**: The primary cause is human action, particularly fossil fuel consumption
> - **Future Harm**: It will lead to serious problems for many people over the long term
> - **Disproportionate Impact**: The poor will suffer the most severe consequences
> - **Governmental Capacity**: Governments (especially wealthy nations) have the ability to mitigate global warming
> - **Limited Window**: It is too late to stop climate change entirely
> - **High Mitigation Cost**: Steps to slow down or reduce severity will be extremely costly (contrary to Broome's view that mitigation is relatively inexpensive)
> - **Moral Imperative**: Despite these costs, governments (especially the USA) still ought to take action

> [!consider] Obligations
> 
> The relationship between collective and individual obligations is complex:
> 
> **Key Principle**: Individual obligations do not automatically follow from collective ones.
> - Governmental duties don't necessarily create corresponding individual duties
> - However, sometimes individual duties do emerge from collective responsibilities
> 
> **Determining Factors**:
> - The nature of the problem (scale, complexity, coordination requirements)
> - Efficacy of individual action
> - Institutional roles and responsibilities
> - Potential harm from uncoordinated individual efforts
> 
> This framework raises questions about what exactly individuals can do regarding climate change, and more importantly, what they ought to do.

> [!example] Safe Bridges
> 
> Consider a scenario involving dangerous bridges in a community:
> 
> **Scenario**:
> - The government has a clear duty to repair dangerous bridges for public safety
> - These bridges pose a significant risk to citizens if left unrepaired
> 
> **Individual Obligation Analysis**:
> - Even if you as an individual had the technical capability and resources to repair a bridge, you would not have a moral obligation to do so
> - Reasons include:
>   - Bridge repair requires coordination and standards
>   - Individual action might interfere with systematic solutions
>   - The responsibility properly belongs to the designated institution
> 
> This example illustrates how some collective obligations don't translate to individual duties, even when the stakes are high.

> [!example] Teaching Arithmetic
> 
> Consider education as a contrasting example:
> 
> **Scenario**:
> - Governments have a duty to provide basic education to children
> - This includes teaching fundamental arithmetic skills
> 
> **Individual Obligation Analysis**:
> - If the government fails to teach your children arithmetic, you would typically need to step in
> - Options might include:
>   - Teaching them yourself
>   - Hiring a tutor
>   - Finding alternative educational resources
> 
> **Why This Differs from Bridges**:
> - The need is immediate and directly affects dependents in your care
> - Individual action is feasible and effective
> - The harm from inaction is significant and falls primarily on those you're responsible for
> 
> This example demonstrates that some collective failures do create individual moral obligations.

> [!example] Wasteful Driving
> 
> **Question at Hand**:
> - Are we morally obligated not to go on pleasure drives in gas-guzzling cars?
> 
> **Initial Intuition**:
> - Both our intuition and Sinnot-Armstrong's initial reaction suggest that yes, we should avoid such activities
> - This seems to conflict with his broader argument that individuals don't have direct climate duties
> 
> **Deeper Analysis**:
> - When we examine this from a principled perspective, the answer becomes more complex
> - The tension between intuition and principle raises important questions about how we determine our moral obligations
> - This example serves as a test case for applying Sinnot-Armstrong's framework to specific individual actions

> [!consider] To Drive or Not to Drive
> 
> First, we need to recognize that intuition alone isn't sufficient to establish a moral duty against driving gas-guzzling cars. We must derive such duties from principled moral foundations.
> 
> Sinnot-Armstrong examines 8 potential moral principles that might establish such a duty, but finds each insufficient:
> 
> | Principle | Explanation | Why It Doesn't Stand |
> | :-------- | :---------- | :------------------- |
> | **1. The Harm Principle** | We must not harm others | One person's pleasure drive does not cause harm by itself - the harm happens only at scale when multiple people engage in this behavior. Individual actions don't directly harm specific people. |
> | **2. The Contribution Principle** | We must not make problems worse | One person's pleasure drive doesn't make any one other person worse off. The critical distinction is that this examines harm on a one-to-one scale, not many-to-many. Individual contributions are negligible. |
> | **3. The Gas Principle** | It's inherently wrong to put certain substances into the atmosphere | There's nothing inherently wrong with emitting gases - water vapor is a greenhouse gas but it's acceptable when cooking. While this argument might be an overgeneralization (cooking emissions are far less harmful than those from gas guzzlers), the principle still ultimately relies on contribution at scale. |
> | **4. The Risk Principle** | We must not increase risk to other people | This principle explains why drunk driving is wrong (even when it doesn't actually hurt anyone in a specific instance). However, it fails for global warming because we cannot easily identify specific victims of climate change as we can with potential car crash victims from drunk driving. |
> | **5. The Universalizability Principle (Kant)** | Our actions must stand even if everyone performed them | This principle is quite powerful, but still fails because if everyone expelled greenhouse gases for pleasure, everyone could coherently do so - in fact, this is largely happening right now. (This raises questions about whether climate duties might be imperfect duties in Kant's framework.) |
> | **6. Doctrine of Double Effect** | We must not harm others intentionally (whether as an end or as a means) | This fails because when we go for pleasure drives we are not intentionally trying to harm others; we are seeking pleasure. However, this raises questions about drunk drivers, who also don't intend to hurt people but are still condemned - what's the relevant difference? |
> | **7. The Ideal Law Principle** | We must not perform actions that ought to be illegal (whether they actually are illegal or not) | This principle fails because pleasure drives should not be illegal - how could such a law even be enforced? More importantly, if such laws were enforced, wouldn't it be governments' responsibility to do so? This circles back to Sinnot-Armstrong's central claim. |
> | **8. The General Action Principle** | We must not perform acts that would be bad if everyone did them | This principle doesn't work generally. Consider if everyone stopped reproducing - we would go extinct, which would be bad. But it doesn't follow that any one person must have a child to prevent extinction. Similarly, it doesn't follow that individuals must stop driving gas-guzzling cars. |
> 
> This comprehensive analysis reinforces Sinnot-Armstrong's broader point: even seemingly straightforward cases of individual climate responsibility are difficult to establish through consistent moral principles. The moral intuition that we should avoid wasteful driving doesn't easily translate to a principled moral obligation based on the frameworks examined.
