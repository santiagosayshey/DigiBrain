> [!motivation] What is Good?
> 
> If moral worth comes from acting according to what we perceive as duty, this creates a troubling problem: what about people who commit terrible acts while sincerely believing they're doing good? For instance, what if Hitler genuinely believed he was fulfilling a moral duty?
> 
> - A moral framework based solely on good intentions seems insufficient
> - We need an objective standard to evaluate actions beyond subjective beliefs
> - Without such a standard, moral relativism threatens any coherent ethical system
> 
> This raises a critical question: **how can we distinguish genuinely moral actions from those merely perceived as moral by the actor?**

> [!idea] The Categorical Imperative
> 
> The categorical imperative provides an objective test for moral actions that goes beyond subjective intentions. It states that one should "act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."
> 
> - Unlike hypothetical imperatives (conditional "if-then" commands), categorical imperatives apply universally regardless of desires or circumstances
> - It has multiple formulations that capture the same underlying principle
> 
> |Formulation|Description|
> |---|---|
> |Universal Law|Act only according to maxims you could rationally will as universal laws|
> |Humanity as End|Treat humanity (in yourself and others) always as an end, never merely as a means|
> |Kingdom of Ends|Act as if you were both subject and sovereign in a kingdom of ends|
> 
> The categorical imperative provides a rational test that moves beyond subjective beliefs to establish objective moral principles based on universalizability and respect for human dignity.

> [!example] Hitler and the Categorical Imperative
> 
> Hitler's actions demonstrate how the categorical imperative helps distinguish genuinely moral actions from those merely perceived as moral:
> 
> - **Universalization Test**: Hitler's principles of racial supremacy and genocide cannot be universalized without contradiction. If everyone followed principles of racial supremacy, humanity would descend into endless conflict.
>     
> - **Humanity as End Test**: Hitler treated millions of people merely as means to his ideological ends, not as ends in themselves with inherent dignity and worth.
>     
> 
> |Action|Universal Law Test|Humanity as End Test|
> |---|---|---|
> |Genocide|Fails - creates contradiction if universalized|Fails - treats people as means only|
> |Racial supremacy|Fails - cannot be coherently willed as universal|Fails - denies equal dignity|
> |Propaganda deception|Fails - universal lying undermines communication|Fails - manipulates people as tools|
> 
> This example illustrates why the good will must be guided by rational principles that can be universally applied. Merely believing one's actions are right is insufficient - they must pass the objective tests of the categorical imperative.
