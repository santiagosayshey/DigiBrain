> [!motivation] The Good Will and Moral Action
> 
> Kant established that a good will is the only thing good without qualification. This raises an important question: **how do we identify actions that express a good will?**
> 
> - We need practical guidance to distinguish morally worthy actions from unworthy ones
> - Our intentions matter, but we need a systematic way to evaluate them
> - Simply relying on consequences or feelings is insufficient for moral judgment
> 
> Kant seeks a rational standard that can universally determine which actions align with moral duty and thus express a good will.

> [!idea] Maxims and Imperatives
> 
> Maxims are subjective principles of action - the personal rules we follow when deciding how to act.
> 
> - They take the form: "I will do X in situation Y to achieve Z"
> - Example: "I will break promises when convenient to avoid personal inconvenience"
> 
> Imperatives are commands of reason that tell us how we ought to act:
> 
> |Type|Definition|Form|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Hypothetical|Conditional commands based on desired outcomes|"If you want X, then do Y"|"If you want to be healthy, then exercise regularly"|
> |Categorical|Unconditional commands that apply regardless of desires|"Do X" (regardless of consequences or desires)|"Keep your promises"|
> 
> The hypothetical imperative depends on contingent goals, while the categorical imperative applies universally to all rational beings, regardless of their particular desires.

> [!idea] The Categorical Imperative
> 
> Kant's categorical imperative serves as the supreme principle of morality that tests whether our maxims align with moral duty.
> 
> Kant formulated five versions of the categorical imperative, with the first two being our primary focus:
> 
> |Formulation|Formal Statement|Simple Explanation|
> |---|---|---|
> |**1. Universal Law Formula** ✓|"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"|Would it work if everyone did what you're planning to do? If not, it's wrong.|
> |**2. Humanity Formula** ✓|"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end"|Never use people just as tools to get what you want; always respect their dignity and worth.|
> |**3. Autonomy Formula**|"Act so that through your maxims you could be a legislator of universal laws"|Act as if you're creating laws for everyone, including yourself.|
> |**4. Kingdom of Ends Formula**|"Act in accordance with the maxims of a universally legislative member of a merely possible kingdom of ends"|Act as if you're part of an ideal community where everyone respects each other's dignity.|
> |**5. Law of Nature Formula**|"Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature"|Imagine your action became a law of nature, like gravity; would this create a workable world?|
> 
> The categorical imperative provides an objective test for moral actions based on reason rather than consequences or feelings.

> [!example] Testing Maxims: The False Promise Scenario
> 
> Consider the maxim: "I will make a false promise to borrow money when I need it, with no intention of repaying it."
> 
> **Universal Law Test:**
> 
> - Step 1: Formulate the maxim clearly [In order to x, I will y]
> - Step 2: Universalize it: "Everyone will make false promises to borrow money when they need it, with no intention of repaying"
> - Step 3: Ask yourself: Can you achieve this maxim's goal in that world? Yes or no?
> - Step 4: Ask yourself
> 
> **Humanity Formula Test:**
> 
> - Are we treating the lender merely as a means? Yes - we're using them purely as a tool to get money
> - Are we respecting their rational nature? No - we're manipulating them by withholding our true intentions, preventing them from making an informed decision
> 
> Under both formulations, making a false promise to borrow money fails the categorical imperative test and would be considered immoral according to Kant. This demonstrates how the categorical imperative provides a rational framework for evaluating the morality of our actions.

> [!consider] Limitations and Extensions
> 
> The categorical imperative faces several challenges in application:
> 
> - Formulating maxims is not straightforward - different formulations of the same action may yield different results
> - The universal law test can be difficult to apply consistently
> - The absolute nature of the categorical imperative allows no exceptions for context
> 
> Extensions to consider:
> 
> - Kant's three other formulations provide additional perspectives on the same fundamental principle
> - Modern Kantians have developed various interpretations to address practical difficulties
> - The tension between universal principles and particular contexts remains a central challenge in Kantian **ethics**
