> [!motivation] What is Good?
> 
> If moral worth comes from acting according to what we perceive as duty, this creates a troubling problem: what about people who commit terrible acts while sincerely believing they're doing good? For instance, what if Hitler genuinely believed he was fulfilling a moral duty?
> 
> - A moral framework based solely on good intentions seems insufficient
> - We need an objective standard to evaluate actions beyond subjective beliefs
> - Without such a standard, moral relativism threatens any coherent ethical system
> 
> This raises a critical question: **how can we distinguish genuinely moral actions from those merely perceived as moral by the actor?**

> [!idea] The Categorical Imperative
> 
> The categorical imperative provides an objective test for moral actions that goes beyond subjective intentions. It states that one should **"act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."**
> 
> In simpler terms, this means:
> 
> - Before acting, ask yourself: **"What if everyone did this?"**
> - If a world where everyone followed your rule would fall apart or contradict itself, the action is immoral
> 
> Kant provided three key formulations of this principle:
> 
> |Formulation|Plain Language Explanation|What It Means|
> |---|---|---|
> |Universal Law|"Would this work if everyone did it?"|Your actions should be based on principles that could work as universal laws for all people without creating contradictions|
> |Humanity as End|"Am I using people like tools, or respecting them as people?"|Never treat people merely as means to achieve your goals, but always respect their inherent dignity and autonomy|
> |Kingdom of Ends|"Does my action create a world where everyone is treated with respect?"|Act as though you live in an ideal community where everyone is both a lawmaker and subject to the same laws|
> 
> Together, these formulations guide us to actions that respect human dignity and create moral consistency regardless of personal desires or circumstances.

> [!example] Hitler and the Categorical Imperative
> 
> Hitler's actions demonstrate how the categorical imperative helps distinguish genuinely moral actions from those merely perceived as moral:
> 
> - **Universalization Test**: Hitler's principles of racial supremacy and genocide cannot be universalized without contradiction. If everyone followed principles of racial supremacy, humanity would descend into endless conflict.
>     
> - **Humanity as End Test**: Hitler treated millions of people merely as means to his ideological ends, not as ends in themselves with inherent dignity and worth.
>     
> 
> |Action|Universal Law Test|Humanity as End Test|
> |---|---|---|
> |Genocide|Fails - creates contradiction if universalized|Fails - treats people as means only|
> |Racial supremacy|Fails - cannot be coherently willed as universal|Fails - denies equal dignity|
> |Propaganda deception|Fails - universal lying undermines communication|Fails - manipulates people as tools|
> 
> This example illustrates why the good will must be guided by rational principles that can be universally applied. Merely believing one's actions are right is insufficient - they must pass the objective tests of the categorical imperative.
