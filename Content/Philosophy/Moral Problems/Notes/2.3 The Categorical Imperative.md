> [!motivation] The Good Will and Moral Action
> 
> Kant established that a good will is the only thing good without qualification. This raises an important question: **how do we identify actions that express a good will?**
> 
> - We need practical guidance to distinguish morally worthy actions from unworthy ones
> - Our intentions matter, but we need a systematic way to evaluate them
> - Simply relying on consequences or feelings is insufficient for moral judgment
> 
> Kant seeks a rational standard that can universally determine which actions align with moral duty and thus express a good will.

> [!idea] Maxims and Imperatives
> 
> Maxims are subjective principles of action - the personal rules we follow when deciding how to act.
> 
> - They take the form: "I will do X in situation Y to achieve Z"
> - Example: "I will break promises when convenient to avoid personal inconvenience"
> 
> Imperatives are commands of reason that tell us how we ought to act:
> 
> |Type|Definition|Form|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Hypothetical|Conditional commands based on desired outcomes|"If you want X, then do Y"|"If you want to be healthy, then exercise regularly"|
> |Categorical|Unconditional commands that apply regardless of desires|"Do X" (regardless of consequences or desires)|"Keep your promises"|
> 
> The hypothetical imperative depends on contingent goals, while the categorical imperative applies universally to all rational beings, regardless of their particular desires.

> [!idea] The Categorical Imperative
> 
> Kant's categorical imperative serves as the supreme principle of morality that tests whether our maxims align with moral duty.
> 
> Kant formulated five versions of the categorical imperative:
> 
> 1. **Universal Law Formula**
>     
>     - "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"
>     - In simple terms: Would it work if everyone did what you're planning to do? If not, it's wrong.
>     - This tests whether your rule could function as a universal principle without breaking down or becoming self-defeating
> 2. **Humanity Formula**
>     
>     - "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end"
>     - In simple terms: Never use people just as tools to get what you want; always respect their dignity and worth.
>     - People have inherent value and deserve respect regardless of how useful they are to your goals
> 3. **Autonomy Formula** (not our focus)
>     
> 4. **Kingdom of Ends Formula** (not our focus)
>     
> 5. **Law of Nature Formula** (not our focus)
>     
> 
> The categorical imperative provides an objective test for moral actions based on reason rather than consequences or feelings.

> [!example] Testing Maxims: The Baby Hitler Scenario
> 
> Consider the maxim: "I will let a drowning child die when I believe they might grow up to cause great harm."
> 
> **Universal Law Test:**
> 
> - Step 1: Formulate the maxim clearly
> - Step 2: Universalize it: "Everyone will let drowning children die when they believe the children might grow up to cause harm"
> - Step 3: Check for contradictions
>     - Logical contradiction? None apparent
>     - Practical contradiction? Yes - universalizing undermines the institution of rescue and our duty to help those in immediate danger based on mere speculation
> 
> **Humanity Formula Test:**
> 
> - Are we treating the child merely as a means? Yes - we're using the child as a means to prevent possible future harm
> - Are we respecting the child's rational nature? No - we're making a decision based on speculation about future actions, not respecting their current status as a human deserving of aid
> 
> Under both formulations, allowing baby Hitler to drown fails the categorical imperative test and would be considered immoral according to Kant.

> [!consider] Limitations and Extensions
> 
> The categorical imperative faces several challenges in application:
> 
> - Formulating maxims is not straightforward - different formulations of the same action may yield different results
> - The universal law test can be difficult to apply consistently
> - The absolute nature of the categorical imperative allows no exceptions for context
> 
> Extensions to consider:
> 
> - Kant's three other formulations provide additional perspectives on the same fundamental principle
> - Modern Kantians have developed various interpretations to address practical difficulties
> - The tension between universal principles and particular contexts remains a central challenge in Kantian **ethics**
