> [!motivation] What is Good?
> 
> If moral worth comes from acting according to what we perceive as duty, this creates a troubling problem: what about people who commit terrible acts while sincerely believing they're doing good? For instance, what if Hitler genuinely believed he was fulfilling a moral duty?
> 
> - A moral framework based solely on good intentions seems insufficient
> - We need an objective standard to evaluate actions beyond subjective beliefs
> - Without such a standard, moral relativism threatens any coherent ethical system
> - The "good will" alone is not enoughâ€”it must be guided by rational principles
> 
> This raises critical questions: **How can we distinguish genuinely moral actions from those merely perceived as moral by the actor? What objective principles should guide our moral decisions?**

> [!consider] From Hypothetical to Categorical Imperatives
> 
> Kant distinguishes between two fundamentally different types of commands or imperatives that guide human action:
> 
> - **Hypothetical Imperatives**: Conditional commands that take the form "If you want X, then do Y"
>     - They represent actions as means to achieve some desired end
>     - Their binding force depends on whether we want the outcome
>     - Example: "If you want to be healthy, then you should exercise regularly"
>     - These are prudential rather than moral commands
> - **Categorical Imperative**: Unconditional command that applies regardless of desires or goals
>     - Commands actions as "objectively necessary in themselves"
>     - Binding on all rational beings regardless of their personal desires
>     - Concerns the form and principle of the action, not its results
>     - Example: "Do not make false promises" (even if doing so would benefit you)
> 
> This distinction reveals why consequences and inclinations cannot be the foundation of morality:
> 
> |Aspect|Hypothetical Imperative|Categorical Imperative|
> |---|---|---|
> |Foundation|Personal desires and goals|Pure practical reason|
> |Applicability|Conditional on what you want|Universal and unconditional|
> |Purpose|Achieving particular outcomes|Conforming to moral law|
> |Example|"Save money to buy a house"|"Never lie, regardless of outcome"|
> 
> The categorical imperative provides the objective standard missing from subjective good intentions. An action is moral only if its guiding principle (maxim) can be universalized without contradiction and respects the inherent dignity of rational beings.

> [!consider] Understanding Maxims
> 
> To apply the categorical imperative, we must first understand what Kant means by **maxims**:
> 
> - A **maxim** is the subjective principle behind your action
>     - It's your personal rule or reason for acting in a certain way
>     - Formulated as: "I will [action] in [circumstance] for [purpose]"
>     - Examples: "I will lie when it benefits me" or "I will help others in need"
> - Maxims reveal the true moral character behind your actions
>     - Two identical actions can have different moral worth based on their maxims
>     - What matters morally is not just what you do, but why you do it
> - The categorical imperative tests these maxims directly
>     - A maxim is moral only if it can be universalized without contradiction
>     - This provides the objective standard missing from subjective intentions
> 
> By focusing on maxims rather than just consequences or feelings, Kant connects our personal reasoning to universal moral principles that all rational beings would recognize.

> [!idea] The Categorical Imperative
> 
> The categorical imperative provides an objective test for moral actions that goes beyond subjective intentions. It states that one should **"act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."**
> 
> In simpler terms, this means:
> 
> - Before acting, ask yourself: **"What if everyone did this?"**
> - If a world where everyone followed your rule would fall apart or contradict itself, the action is immoral
> 
> Kant provided two key formulations of this principle (there are actually 5, but we're only learning 2):
> 
> |Formulation|Plain Language Explanation|What It Means|
> |---|---|---|
> |Universal Law|"Would this work if everyone did it?"|Your actions should be based on principles that could work as universal laws for all people without creating contradictions|
> |Humanity as End|"Am I using people like tools, or respecting them as people?"|Never treat people merely as means to achieve your goals, but always respect their inherent dignity and autonomy|
> 
> Together, these formulations guide us to actions that respect human dignity and create moral consistency regardless of personal desires or circumstances.

> [!idea] Testing Your Maxims
> 
> The categorical imperative gives us a practical process for evaluating our maxims:
> 
> 1. **Identify your maxim**: What principle are you really following?
>     - Example: "I will make false promises when I need money"
> 2. **Universalize it**: Imagine a world where everyone follows this principle
>     - Example: "Everyone makes false promises whenever they need money"
> 3. **Check for contradictions**: Would such a world be coherent?
>     - Example: If everyone made false promises, promises would become meaningless, creating a contradiction
> 
> Here's how different maxims fare under this test:
> 
> |Maxim|Universal Version|Result|
> |---|---|---|
> |"I will lie when convenient"|"Everyone lies when convenient"|Fails - destroys the possibility of communication|
> |"I will help others in need"|"Everyone helps others in need"|Passes - creates no contradiction|
> |"I will develop my talents only when profitable"|"Everyone develops talents only when profitable"|Fails - contradicts our rational nature|
> 
> This testing process transforms ethics from subjective feelings to rational principles that any thinking being would recognize as valid.

> [!example] Hitler and the Categorical Imperative
> 
> Hitler's actions demonstrate how the categorical imperative helps distinguish genuinely moral actions from those merely perceived as moral:
> 
> - **Universalization Test**: Hitler's principles of racial supremacy and genocide cannot be universalized without contradiction. If everyone followed principles of racial supremacy, humanity would descend into endless conflict.
>     
> - **Humanity as End Test**: Hitler treated millions of people merely as means to his ideological ends, not as ends in themselves with inherent dignity and worth.
>     
> 
> |Action|Universal Law Test|Humanity as End Test|
> |---|---|---|
> |Genocide|Fails - creates contradiction if universalized|Fails - treats people as means only|
> |Racial supremacy|Fails - cannot be coherently willed as universal|Fails - denies equal dignity|
> |Propaganda deception|Fails - universal lying undermines communication|Fails - manipulates people as tools|
> 
> This example illustrates why the good will must be guided by rational principles that can be universally applied. Merely believing one's actions are right is insufficient - they must pass the objective tests of the categorical imperative.
