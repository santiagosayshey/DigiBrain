> [!motivation] The Good Will and Moral Action
> 
> Kant established that a good will is the only thing good without qualification. This raises an important question: **how do we identify actions that express a good will?**
> 
> - We need practical guidance to distinguish morally worthy actions from unworthy ones
> - Our intentions matter, but we need a systematic way to evaluate them
> - Simply relying on consequences or feelings is insufficient for moral judgment
> 
> Kant seeks a rational standard that can universally determine which actions align with moral duty and thus express a good will.

> [!idea] Maxims and Imperatives
> 
> Maxims are subjective principles of action - the personal rules we follow when deciding how to act.
> 
> - They take the form: "I will do X in situation Y to achieve Z"
> - Example: "I will break promises when convenient to avoid personal inconvenience"
> 
> Imperatives are commands of reason that tell us how we ought to act:
> 
> |Type|Definition|Form|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Hypothetical|Conditional commands based on desired outcomes|"If you want X, then do Y"|"If you want to be healthy, then exercise regularly"|
> |Categorical|Unconditional commands that apply regardless of desires|"Do X" (regardless of consequences or desires)|"Keep your promises"|
> 
> The hypothetical imperative depends on contingent goals, while the categorical imperative applies universally to all rational beings, regardless of their particular desires.

> [!idea] The Categorical Imperative
> 
> Kant's categorical imperative serves as the supreme principle of morality that tests whether our maxims align with moral duty.
> 
> Kant formulated five versions of the categorical imperative, with the first two being our primary focus:
> 
> |Formulation|Formal Statement|Simple Explanation|
> |---|---|---|
> |**1. Universal Law Formula** ✓|"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"|Would it work if everyone did what you're planning to do? If not, it's wrong.|
> |**2. Humanity Formula** ✓|"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end"|Never use people just as tools to get what you want; always respect their dignity and worth.|
> |**3. Autonomy Formula**|"Act so that through your maxims you could be a legislator of universal laws"|Act as if you're creating laws for everyone, including yourself.|
> |**4. Kingdom of Ends Formula**|"Act in accordance with the maxims of a universally legislative member of a merely possible kingdom of ends"|Act as if you're part of an ideal community where everyone respects each other's dignity.|
> |**5. Law of Nature Formula**|"Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature"|Imagine your action became a law of nature, like gravity; would this create a workable world?|
> 
> The categorical imperative provides an objective test for moral actions based on reason rather than consequences or feelings.

> [!example] Testing Maxims: The False Promise Scenario
> 
> Consider the maxim: "I will make a false promise to borrow money when I need it, with no intention of repaying it."
> 
> **Universal Law Test:**
> 
> - Step 1: Formulate the maxim clearly [In order to x, I will y]
> - Step 2: Universalize it: "Everyone will make false promises to borrow money when they need it, with no intention of repaying"
> - Step 3: Ask yourself: Can you achieve this maxim's goal in that world? No, because in a world where everyone makes false promises about repayment, the practice of lending would collapse. No one would believe promises to repay, so no one would lend money. The very concept of borrowing would become meaningless, making it impossible to achieve your goal of obtaining money through promises.
>     - _Note: Step 3 tests for practical contradictions - whether the universalized maxim would make your intended action impossible to perform (a "contradiction in conception")._
> - Step 4: Ask yourself: Can i rationally will my maxim in that world? No! You cannot rationally desire a world where all promises are false. You yourself would be unable to rely on others' promises, making many normal transactions impossible. You would lose the benefits of living in a society where people can trust each other's word.
>     - _Note: Step 4 tests for principled contradictions - whether you could consistently desire this maxim as a universal law without undermining your own rational interests (a "contradiction in the will")._
> 
> **Humanity Formula Test:**
> 
> - Are we treating the lender merely as a means? Yes - we're using them purely as a tool to get money
> - Are we respecting their rational nature? No - we're manipulating them by withholding our true intentions, preventing them from making an informed decision
> 
> Under both formulations, making a false promise to borrow money fails the categorical imperative test and would be considered immoral according to Kant. This demonstrates how the categorical imperative provides a rational framework for evaluating the morality of our actions.

> [!idea] Imperfect Duties and Step 4 Failures
> 
> Imperfect duties (like helping others or developing talents) typically fail at Step 4 rather than Step 3. For example, the maxim "I will never help anyone in need" can be conceptually universalized without contradiction—a world where no one helps others could exist. However, it fails Step 4 because:
> 
> - As rational beings, we cannot consistently will a world where no assistance is given, as we ourselves might need help someday
> - Such a world contradicts our own rational self-interest
> - Unlike perfect duties (which create "contradictions in conception"), imperfect duties create "contradictions in the will"—we cannot rationally prefer such a world
> 
> This distinction explains why perfect duties (like "don't lie") are strict prohibitions, while imperfect duties allow flexibility in how they're fulfilled.

> [!consider] Objections to the Formula of Universal Law - False Positives/Negatives
> 
> Critics of Kant's Formula of Universal Law (FUL) point to several potential problems:
> 
> **False Positives:** The FUL may incorrectly classify some morally permissible actions as immoral.
> 
> - Example: "I will become a doctor to make money" seems to fail universalization (not everyone can be a doctor), but isn't inherently immoral
> - The test can be overly sensitive to how maxims are formulated
> 
> **False Negatives:** The FUL may fail to identify some immoral actions.
> 
> - Example: "I will kill people with blue eyes" could technically be universalized without contradiction if formulated carefully
> - Some trivial or arbitrary maxims might pass the test despite being problematic
> 
> These objections suggest that while the FUL provides valuable moral insight, it may need supplementation with Kant's other formulations of the Categorical Imperative.

> [!consider] Objection to the Formula of Universal Law - Absolute Requirements
> 
> Another significant criticism of Kant's Formula of Universal Law is its absolutism:
> 
> - The FUL generates exceptionless moral rules that apply regardless of consequences
> - Example: The prohibition against lying would apply even if lying could save an innocent life
> - Critics argue this rigidity fails to account for morally relevant contextual factors
> - Real-world moral dilemmas often involve conflicting duties with no clear resolution under Kant's framework
> - This raises questions about whether any moral principle can be truly absolute without producing counterintuitive results in extreme cases
> 
> This objection highlights the tension between Kant's deontological approach and consequentialist moral theories that prioritize outcomes over absolute rules.
