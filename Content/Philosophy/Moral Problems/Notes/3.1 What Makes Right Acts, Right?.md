> [!motivation] Limitations of Traditional Moral Theories
> 
> Ethical dilemmas expose gaps in major moral frameworks. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing good outcomes, disregarding the independent value of principles like promise-keeping or justice. Kantian ethics emphasizes rigid moral rules that cannot be broken regardless of consequences. Neither approach adequately handles situations where multiple moral considerations conflict. **How can we account for both the importance of consequences and the value of different moral principles?**

> [!idea] Prima Facie Duties
> 
> Prima facie duties provide a solution to the limitations of both utilitarianism and Kantian ethics.
> 
> - These are **moral obligations that always matter but can be overridden when they conflict**
> - Include duties like fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence
> - No single duty always takes priority - their importance varies by situation
> - When duties conflict, we determine our "all-things-considered duty" by weighing which duty is most important in that specific context
> 
> This approach respects both the consequentialist concerns of utilitarianism and the principle-based ethics of Kantianism without the limitations of either theory.
