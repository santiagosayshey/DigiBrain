> [!motivation] Limitations of Traditional Moral Theories
> 
> Ethical dilemmas expose gaps in major moral frameworks. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing good outcomes, disregarding the independent value of principles like promise-keeping or justice. Kantian ethics emphasizes rigid moral rules that cannot be broken regardless of consequences. Neither approach adequately handles situations where multiple moral considerations conflict. **How can we account for both the importance of consequences and the value of different moral principles?**

> [!idea] Prima Facie Duties
> 
> Prima facie duties provide a solution to the limitations of both utilitarianism and Kantian ethics.
> 
> - These are **moral obligations that always matter but can be overridden when they conflict**
> - Include duties like fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence
> - No single duty always takes priority - their importance varies by situation
> - When duties conflict, we determine our "all-things-considered duty" by weighing which duty is most important in that specific context
> 
> This approach respects both the consequentialist concerns of utilitarianism and the principle-based ethics of Kantianism without the limitations of either theory.

> [!consider] Are Prima Facie Duties Self-Evident?
> 
> Ross claims prima facie duties are **self-evident** moral truths we know directly without further justification:
> 
> - These duties aren't derived from higher principles but represent distinct, irreducible moral considerations
> - We grasp them through moral intuition, similar to recognizing basic logical truths
> - Ross sees them as objective and universal, though their relative importance varies by situation
> - While the general principles are self-evident, their application in complex cases requires judgment
> 
> This reliance on self-evidence captures our intuition that certain moral considerations matter inherently, not just for their consequences, but raises questions about how to resolve conflicts between duties.

> [!idea] Moore's Ideal Utilitarianism
> 
> Moore's theory represents a sophisticated evolution of utilitarian thinking:
> 
> - Right actions are those that produce **more good than any alternative option**
> - This maintains the consequentialist framework (judging actions by results)
> - Unlike classical utilitarianism, it recognizes **multiple intrinsic goods**
> - The theory allows for ranking different kinds of goods and recognizing qualitative differences
> - It avoids the reductionism of seeing all value as reducible to pleasure or happiness
> 
> This approach can better account for our intuitions that some non-pleasurable states (like knowledge or virtue) have intrinsic value independent of the happiness they produce.

> [!consider] Good vs. Happiness: What's the Difference?
> 
> The distinction between "good" and "happiness" is central to understanding Moore's departure from classical utilitarianism:
> 
> - **Happiness/Pleasure**: A subjective feeling state; the sole intrinsic good according to hedonistic utilitarianism
> - **Good**: A broader concept that includes happiness but also encompasses:
>     - Development of character and virtue
>     - Knowledge and understanding
>     - Beauty and aesthetic experiences
>     - Justice and fairness
> 
> This raises important questions: How do we weigh different kinds of goods against each other? Can we measure non-hedonic goods? Does broadening "the good" make ethical decision-making more complex but more accurate, or simply more ambiguous?
