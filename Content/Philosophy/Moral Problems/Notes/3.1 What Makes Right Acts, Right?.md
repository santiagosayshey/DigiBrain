> [!motivation] Limitations of Traditional Moral Theories
> 
> Ethical dilemmas expose gaps in major moral frameworks. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing good outcomes, disregarding the independent value of principles like promise-keeping or justice. Kantian ethics emphasizes rigid moral rules that cannot be broken regardless of consequences. Neither approach adequately handles situations where multiple moral considerations conflict. **How can we account for both the importance of consequences and the value of different moral principles?**

> [!idea] Prima Facie Duties
> 
> Prima facie duties provide a solution to the limitations of both utilitarianism and Kantian ethics.
> 
> - These are **moral obligations that always matter but can be overridden when they conflict**
> - Include duties like fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence
> - No single duty always takes priority - their importance varies by situation
> - When duties conflict, we determine our "all-things-considered duty" by weighing which duty is most important in that specific context
> 
> This approach respects both the consequentialist concerns of utilitarianism and the principle-based ethics of Kantianism without the limitations of either theory.

> [!consider] Are Prima Facie Duties Self-Evident?
> 
> Ross claims prima facie duties are **self-evident** moral truths we know directly without further justification:
> 
> - These duties aren't derived from higher principles but represent distinct, irreducible moral considerations
> - We grasp them through moral intuition, similar to recognizing basic logical truths
> - Ross sees them as objective and universal, though their relative importance varies by situation
> - While the general principles are self-evident, their application in complex cases requires judgment
> 
> This reliance on self-evidence captures our intuition that certain moral considerations matter inherently, not just for their consequences, but raises questions about how to resolve conflicts between duties.

> [!consider] What Does "Prima Facie Duty" Really Mean?
> 
> Ross himself acknowledges the term "prima facie duty" is problematic:
> 
> - It's **not actually a type of duty** at all, but something related to duty in a specific way
> - It doesn't mean "apparent at first glance" but rather an **objective moral consideration**
> - It represents a moral feature that would constitute a full duty if it were the only morally relevant feature present
> 
> A better understanding might be:
> 
> - **Moral consideration** - A feature of a situation that creates a genuine moral reason to act in a certain way
> - **Pro tanto reason** - A reason that genuinely matters but can be outweighed (many philosophers now use this term instead)
> - **Standing moral requirement** - Always relevant but not always decisive
> 
> When Ross says a prima facie duty is "an objective fact involved in the nature of the situation, or more strictly in an element of its nature," he means these considerations exist objectively in the moral landscape, not just in our perceptions. Unlike full duties, which arise from the complete situation, prima facie duties arise from particular aspects of situations (promises, relationships, potential harms) that create genuine but potentially overridable moral claims on us.
