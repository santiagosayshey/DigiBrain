> [!motivation] Limitations of Traditional Moral Theories
> 
> Ethical dilemmas expose gaps in major moral frameworks. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing good outcomes, disregarding the independent value of principles like promise-keeping or justice. Kantian ethics emphasizes rigid moral rules that cannot be broken regardless of consequences. Neither approach adequately handles situations where multiple moral considerations conflict. **How can we account for both the importance of consequences and the value of different moral principles?**

> [!idea] Prima Facie Duties
> 
> W.D. Ross (1877-1971) proposed that we have multiple moral duties that create genuine obligations but can sometimes be overridden in specific situations. These "prima facie duties" include:
> 
> - Benevolence (promoting others' wellbeing)
> - Fidelity to promises
> - Avoiding harm
> - Justice
> - Gratitude
> - Reparation
> - Truth-telling
> 
> When duties conflict, we must determine which duty carries more weight in that specific circumstance. The winning duty becomes our "actual duty" - what we should ultimately do after considering all relevant moral factors. Unlike utilitarianism, Ross recognizes multiple sources of moral obligation. Unlike Kantianism, he allows that duties can sometimes be overridden when they conflict.
