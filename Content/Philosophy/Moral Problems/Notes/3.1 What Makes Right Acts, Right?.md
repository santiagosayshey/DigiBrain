> [!motivation] Limitations of Traditional Moral Theories
> 
> Ethical dilemmas expose gaps in major moral frameworks. Utilitarianism focuses solely on maximizing good outcomes, disregarding the independent value of principles like promise-keeping or justice. Kantian ethics emphasizes rigid moral rules that cannot be broken regardless of consequences. Neither approach adequately handles situations where multiple moral considerations conflict. **How can we account for both the importance of consequences and the value of different moral principles?**

> [!idea] Prima Facie Duties Theory
> 
> W.D. Ross's Prima Facie Duties Theory states that multiple moral duties can simultaneously apply to a situation, with none being absolute.
> 
> - Seven prima facie duties: benevolence, fidelity, truth-telling, non-maleficence, gratitude, justice, and reparation
> - Each duty creates a genuine moral obligation but can be overridden in specific circumstances
> - No predetermined hierarchy among duties - requires case-by-case judgment
> - Actual duty ("all-things-considered" duty) emerges from weighing competing considerations
> 
> This pluralistic approach bridges utilitarianism's concern for outcomes with Kantianism's emphasis on inherent moral principles.
