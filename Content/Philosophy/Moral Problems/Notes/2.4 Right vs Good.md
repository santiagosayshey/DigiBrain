> [!motivation] The Challenge of Ethical Evaluation
> 
> Determining the foundation of moral judgment presents a fundamental challenge in ethics. When evaluating actions, should we focus on the nature of the action itself or on its outcomes?
> 
> Key questions this comparison addresses:
> 
> - How do we determine if an action is morally permissible?
> - Is an action right because it produces good outcomes or because it follows moral principles?
> - Can we develop a coherent ethical framework that provides consistent guidance across different situations?

> [!idea] Kantian Ethics: Prioritizing the Right
> 
> Kantian ethics evaluates actions based on their inherent rightness, independent of their consequences. An action is right if it follows universal moral principles derived from reason.
> 
> **Key principles:**
> 
> - **Categorical Imperative**: Act only according to maxims that you could will to become universal law
> - **Humanity Formula**: Treat humanity always as an end, never merely as a means
> - **Kingdom of Ends**: Act as if you were both subject and legislator in a kingdom of ends
> 
> **Understanding "Right" in Kantian Ethics:**
> 
> - Right action stems from good will and duty
> - Moral worth depends on acting from duty, not inclination
> - The right is prior to and independent of the good
> - Consequences do not determine rightness
> 
> |Kant's Key Concept|Meaning|
> |---|---|
> |Good Will|The only thing good without qualification|
> |Duty|Acting from respect for the moral law|
> |Autonomy|Self-governance through reason|

> [!idea] Consequentialism: Prioritizing the Good
> 
> Consequentialism evaluates actions based solely on their outcomes or consequences. An action is right if it produces the most good.
> 
> **Key principles:**
> 
> - **Consequentialist Formula**: Right action maximizes good consequences
> - **Value Theory**: Identifying what counts as "good" (pleasure, preference satisfaction, etc.)
> - **Impartiality**: Equal consideration of all affected beings
> 
> **Understanding "Good" in Consequentialism:**
> 
> - The right is defined in terms of the good
> - Good is determined by states of affairs, not intentions
> - Actions have no intrinsic moral value
> - Moral evaluation focuses on outcomes, not processes
> 
> |Type of Consequentialism|Definition of "Good"|
> |---|---|
> |Utilitarianism|Happiness, pleasure, or utility|
> |Preference Consequentialism|Preference satisfaction|
> |Pluralistic Consequentialism|Multiple intrinsic goods|

> [!consider] Right vs. Good: Philosophical Tensions
> 
> The distinction between prioritizing "right" or "good" creates fundamental tensions in ethical theory.
> 
> **Kantian Challenges:**
> 
> - Rigid principles may lead to counterintuitive conclusions
> - Difficulty resolving conflicts between duties
> - Limited consideration of outcomes that matter to human welfare
> - Hard to account for moral luck and circumstances beyond control
> 
> **Consequentialist Challenges:**
> 
> - Permits intuitively wrong actions if they maximize good consequences
> - Difficulty measuring and comparing different goods
> - May undervalue rights and justice in pursuit of maximizing good
> - Requires impossible knowledge of all future consequences
> 
> **The Priority Question:**
> 
> - Kant: Right is prior to good; good is conceptually dependent on right
> - Consequentialism: Good is prior to right; right is conceptually dependent on good
> - Mixed theories: Attempt to balance priority of right and good

> [!example] The Lying Promise Dilemma
> 
> Consider a scenario where you could make a false promise to obtain money you urgently need, knowing you cannot repay it.
> 
> **Kantian Analysis:**
> 
> - Apply the Categorical Imperative: Can everyone make false promises when convenient?
> - Universal adoption would undermine the institution of promising
> - The lie treats the lender as a mere means to your ends
> - Conclusion: The action is wrong regardless of outcomes
> 
> **Consequentialist Analysis:**
> 
> - Calculate expected consequences of the lie versus telling truth
> - Consider immediate benefits against potential harms
> - Weigh effects on social trust and promising practices
> - Conclusion: Action is right if and only if it produces best overall outcome
> 
> This example highlights the fundamental difference: Kantians focus on the inherent wrongness of lying, while consequentialists focus on whether lying produces the best outcome in this specific situation.

> [!consider] Hybrid Approaches: Reconciling Right and Good
> 
> Several ethical frameworks attempt to incorporate insights from both traditions.
> 
> **Rule Consequentialism:**
> 
> - Evaluates rules rather than individual actions
> - Rules selected based on consequences when generally followed
> - Preserves rule-following aspect of deontology while maintaining focus on outcomes
> 
> **Threshold Deontology:**
> 
> - Follows deontological principles under normal circumstances
> - Permits consequentialist reasoning when stakes exceed a certain threshold
> - Acknowledges both principles and outcomes matter
> 
> **Virtue Ethics:**
> 
> - Shifts focus from actions to character traits
> - Virtuous person has practical wisdom to balance principles and outcomes
> - Considers both the nature of actions and their effects
