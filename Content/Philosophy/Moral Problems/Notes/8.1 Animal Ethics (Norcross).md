> [!motivation] Factory Farming
> 
> Factory farming, also known as intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production, is a system designed to maximize production while minimizing costs by confining large numbers of animals in small, controlled environments. This practice raises significant ethical concerns regarding the treatment and welfare of animals.
> 
> Key facts about factory farming:
> - Breeding sows (female pigs) are confined to gestation crates for 3.8 months during pregnancy, in spaces so small they cannot turn around
> - Approximately 81 billion chickens are raised for food annually around the world
> - Animal agriculture contributes to 16.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions
> 
> These industrial farming practices prioritize efficiency and profit over animal welfare, raising profound ethical questions about our moral obligations toward non-human animals. Philosopher Alastair Norcross challenges us to consider whether the pleasure humans derive from eating meat justifies the suffering inflicted on animals in factory farms. 
> 
> Norcross's work examines the ethical implications of supporting systems that cause extreme animal suffering merely for human taste preferences. His arguments form the foundation for a critical examination of our treatment of animals in food production and the moral weight we should assign to animal suffering compared to relatively trivial human pleasures.

| 2         | Consider         | The Story of Fred              | Not going to give you much notes here under the assumption you know of the story of Fred (car accident, loves chocolate, cant taste it anymore, so he tortures puppies to extract their cocomone hormone to enjoy chocolate again), to serve as the backdrop for the rest of the note. They key thing with this consider is to get the reader questioning not whether Fred is wrong or not, but WHY he is wrong (as most of us would intuitively and passionately agree with)<br><br>Now, here you introduce the key point of the note. If you agree that what Fred does here is wrong, then surely you also agree that the consumption and torture of animals through factory farming is equally wrong, right? How can we hold both truths that Fred is wrong and we are right to eat these animals? Norcross says we cant!

| 4         | Consider         | The Direct Torturer Objection  | To prove P1 as wrong, we can look to show that the two cases are NOT equivalent as Norcross suggests (similar to what we did for euthanasia)<br><br>The Direct Torturer Objection - Fred DIRECTLY tortures the puppies, whereas consumers of factory farmed meat do not do this, some don't even know what goes into farming animals. <br><br>Norcross says this does not matter. its not relevant. why? Mostly because Norcross is basing on outcome here. Fred could hire someone to do the torturing for him, and most of us would still consider it wrong. A tortured animal is a tortured animal is what he is saying (it does not matter why the animal was tortured or by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 6         | Consider         | The Causal Impotency Objection | If Fred did not like Chocolate, he would not need to torture puppies and thus the torturing of puppies would come to a full stop. Fred is said to be causally efficacious. <br><br>In contrast, if an average consumer of factory farmed animals stopped eating meat, there would still be a need to factory farm animals (there are billions of them) - essentially their choice to eat or NOT to eat, doesnt matter in the same way that Fred eating chocolate does. They are said to be casually impotent - not able to effect change through their behaviour.<br><br>Norcross has two responses to this objection (maybe we should split into multiple callouts here? you can decide)<br>1. The Wrongs Do Not Require Harms (Mousse Al la Bama) - explain the scenario here. Friend gives you a drink with cocomone in it which enhances the dessert that comes after. Friend argues that it doesnt matter where it came from (its not morally relevent) because it would have happened regardless if you drank it or not - so you might as well.  Norcross argues its wrong not because you did something bad as a consequence, but because by drinking it, you are supporting in spirit, the torture of puppes. do a small note here that the germans hava a word for this - mitlaufer. Just because you yourself do not murder Jews, does not make you any better than a Nazi if you allow the systematic killing of Jews to occur. <br>2. The Denial of Causal Impotence - Norcross simply disagrees here the average consumer is causally impotent. It is simply a matter of statistics - if it takes 10,000 people to go vegetarian to save 250,000 chickens, then on average, a single person going vegetarian will save 25 chickens. So they DO make a difference, just a small one. When we look at through this perspective, this is much the same as Fred's scenario. If he does not eat chocolate, then it saves 26 dogs (also make sure to explicitly saay 26 dogs were tortured  in the basement in the example in callout 2). also be clear here in saying that 9999 people do not save 0 chickens and the 10000th saves 250,000. The results of their actions are simply delayed.<br>3. The Puppies Objection - Fred's behavior is worse because killing puppies is worse than killing farm animals. They 'count' more. Norcross denies this difference - puppies do not possess a property that defines a difference (expand slightly here) and talk about how our biases (looks, history, etc) convince us of this difference, but in reality, its not morally significant<br> |
