> [!motivation] World Hunger
> 
> World hunger is a widespread and persistent global issue affecting millions. Despite sufficient global food production, substantial populations face chronic undernutrition and food insecurity.
> 
> - **Scale**: Approximately 9% of the global population (700+ million people) experience chronic hunger.
>     
> - **Consequences**: Leads to severe health issues, economic instability, and impedes social development, disproportionately impacting developing countries.
>     
> 
> |Region|Undernourished (%)|Affected Population|
> |---|---|---|
> |Africa|20%|~250 million|
> |Asia|8.6%|~418 million|
> |Latin America|7%|~42 million|
> 
> The persistence and severity of world hunger raise crucial ethical questions: **Do individuals, governments, or affluent societies have a moral obligation to aid the world's poor?** If so, how strong or binding is this obligation? Alternatively, should such aid be viewed merely as charitable generosity rather than a duty of justice?

> [!idea] Justice vs. Charity
> 
> Distinguishing between charity and justice is essential for addressing ethical obligations towards global poverty.
> 
> - Justice involves **actions owed as moral or ethical duties**. Failing to act justly constitutes wrongdoing or injustice.
>     
> - Charity refers to **voluntary giving or assistance beyond moral obligations**. Charity is commendable but not ethically mandatory.
>     
> 
> The ethical debate on world hunger revolves around classifying aid as justice (mandatory ethical duty) or charity (optional generosity).

> [!consider] Singer's View in _Famine, Affluence, and Morality_
> 
> Singer argues that **affluent individuals have a strong moral obligation to assist those suffering from hunger and poverty**, asserting that failing to prevent severe suffering when we can do so easily is **morally equivalent to causing harm directly**.
> 
> - **Belief**: If it is within our power to prevent severe harm without sacrificing something of comparable moral significance, we ought morally to do so.
>     
> - **Reasoning**: Singer uses common moral intuitions—such as the duty to save a drowning child if it involves minimal sacrifice—to illustrate that our ethical beliefs already commit us to addressing global poverty.
>     
> 
> Singer is an act utilitarian, but his central premise does not rely on utilitarianism. Instead, he appeals directly to existing moral intuitions to demonstrate consistency in ethical reasoning, suggesting we should already be committed to aiding the global poor.
