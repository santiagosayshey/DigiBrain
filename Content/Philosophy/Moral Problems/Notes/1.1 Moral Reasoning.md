> [!motivation] Arguments in Moral Reasoning
> 
> Moral reasoning requires justification for ethical positions.
> 
> - Like all reasoning, it involves providing reasons to support conclusions
> - Arguments allow us to evaluate ethical claims systematically
> - Proper moral reasoning aims to avoid false beliefs and logical errors
> - We need both true premises and valid reasoning to reach sound conclusions

> [!idea] Structure of Arguments
> 
> An argument consists of premises (reasons) and a conclusion these reasons support.
> 
> - **Premises**: Claims offered as reasons or evidence
> - **Conclusion**: The position being defended, often signaled by words like "therefore," "hence," "thus," or "so"
> - **Argument**: The complete chain of reasoning from premises to conclusion
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Premises|Support the conclusion|"Heroin is a drug"|
> |Conclusion|Position being defended|"Heroin use is immoral"|

> [!consider] Validity and Soundness
> 
> Validity concerns logical structure, while soundness includes truth of premises.
> 
> **Testing for validity**:
> 
> 1. Identify all premises
> 2. Assume all premises are true (even if some are actually false)
> 3. Ask: Could the conclusion be false while all premises are true?
>     - If yes: argument is invalid
>     - If no: argument is valid
> 
> **Sound arguments** require:
> 
> - Valid logical structure
> - All premises are actually true
> 
> An argument can be valid but unsound if it contains false premises.

> [!example] Testing Arguments
> 
> Consider this argument about John Quincy Adams:
> 
> 1. John Quincy Adams was either the eighth or ninth US president
> 2. John Quincy Adams was not the eighth US president
> 3. Therefore, John Quincy Adams was the ninth US president
> 
> **Validity analysis**:
> 
> - If premises 1 and 2 were true, conclusion 3 must be true
> - The argument is logically valid
> 
> **Soundness analysis**:
> 
> - Premise 1 is false (Adams was actually the sixth president)
> - Despite valid structure, the argument is unsound due to a false premise
> - The conclusion is false

> [!consider] Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
> 
> In evaluating arguments, distinguish between conditions that must be present versus those that guarantee an outcome.
> 
> - **Necessary condition**: A condition that must be met for the conclusion to be true
>     - Example: Being at least 35 years old is necessary to be US President
>     - Functions like AND statements - ALL necessary conditions must be satisfied
> - **Sufficient condition**: A condition that guarantees the conclusion is true
>     - Example: Being born in the US is sufficient for US citizenship
>     - Functions like OR statements - ANY sufficient condition guarantees the conclusion
> 
> Multiple necessary conditions create requirements that must all be met, while multiple sufficient conditions offer different pathways to the same conclusion.

> [!idea] Valid Argument Forms
> 
> These standard argument patterns guarantee valid reasoning when correctly applied.
> 
> **Logical Terminology**:
> 
> - **Conditional**: An "if-then" statement showing a relationship between conditions (the first premise of MP and MT; below)
> - **Antecedent**: The "if" part of a conditional statement (P in "If P, then Q"). It specifies a *sufficient* condition for the consequent. 
> - **Consequent**: The "then" part of a conditional statement (Q in "If P, then Q"). It specifies a *necessary* condition for the antecedent.
> 
> **Modus Ponens (Affirming the Antecedent)**
> 
> - Structure:
>     1. If P, then Q
>     2. P is true
>     3. Therefore, Q is true
> - Example: If it rains, the ground gets wet. It is raining. Therefore, the ground is wet.
> - It's valid because P is **sufficient** for Q, so if P exists, so does Q. 
> 
> **Modus Tollens (Denying the Consequent)**
> 
> - Structure:
>     1. If P, then Q
>     2. Q is false
>     3. Therefore, P is false
> - Example: If it rains, the ground gets wet. The ground is not wet. Therefore, it is not raining.
> - It's valid because Q is **necessary** for P, so if Q does not exist, P can't either
> 
> **Hypothetical Syllogism (Chain Argument)**
> 
> - Structure:
>     1. If P, then Q
>     2. If Q, then R
>     3. Therefore, if P, then R
> - Example: If I study, I'll pass the exam. If I pass the exam, I'll graduate. Therefore, if I study, I'll graduate.

> [!idea] Common Logical Fallacies
> 
> Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine argument validity.
> 
> **Formal Fallacies** (errors in logical structure):
> 
> - **Affirming the Consequent**: If P→Q, Q, therefore P (invalid reverse of modus ponens)
> - **Denying the Antecedent**: If P→Q, not P, therefore not Q (invalid reverse of modus tollens)
> - **Circular Reasoning**: Using the conclusion as a premise
> 
> **Informal Fallacies** (errors in content rather than structure):
> 
> - **Ad Hominem**: Attacking the person instead of their argument
> - **Appeal to Authority**: Accepting claims solely based on someone's status
> - **Slippery Slope**: Claiming one event will inevitably lead to extreme outcomes
> - **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting an opponent's position to make it easier to attack
> - **False Dilemma**: Presenting only two options when others exist
> 
> Identifying fallacies helps distinguish between sound and unsound moral arguments.
