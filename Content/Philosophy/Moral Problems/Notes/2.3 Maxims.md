> [!motivation] Understanding Maxims
> 
> At the heart of Kant's moral philosophy is the concept of **maxims** - the subjective principles that guide our actions.
> 
> - A maxim is your personal rule or policy for action (e.g., "I will lie when it benefits me")
> - Maxims reveal the true moral character of an action beyond its visible effects
> - Two identical actions can have different moral worth depending on their underlying maxims
> - The moral test is whether your personal maxim is fit to be universal
> 
> This raises important questions: **How do we formulate the maxims behind our actions? Why can't we simply rely on good intentions? What makes a maxim worthy of becoming universal law?**

> [!consider] From Personal Maxims to Universal Laws
> 
> Kant's moral framework hinges on the relationship between your subjective maxims and objective moral laws:
> 
> - **Personal Maxims**: Subjective principles that guide your individual actions
>     - Typically formulated as "I will [action] in [circumstance] for [purpose]"
>     - Represent your practical reasoning about what to do
>     - May be based on self-interest, inclination, or moral duty
>     - Example: "I will make a false promise when I need money"
> - **Universal Moral Laws**: Principles that would be valid for all rational beings
>     - Must be derivable from pure practical reason
>     - Apply regardless of personal desires or circumstances
>     - Cannot depend on contingent facts about human psychology
>     - Example: "No one should ever make false promises"
> 
> The categorical imperative provides the test that transforms subjective maxims into objective moral laws:
> 
> |Maxim Type|Foundation|Universal Status|Moral Worth|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Self-interested|Personal advantage|Cannot be universalized|Lacks moral worth|
> |Inclination-based|Feelings and desires|May fail universalization|Contingent worth|
> |Duty-based|Respect for moral law|Can be universalized|True moral worth|
> 
> This process shows why moral actions must come from maxims that respect rational nature itself, not merely from good feelings or beneficial outcomes.

> [!idea] Testing Your Maxims
> 
> The categorical imperative gives us a practical method for evaluating our maxims before acting:
> 
> 1. **Identify your maxim**: "What principle am I actually following?"
> 2. **Universalize it**: "What if everyone followed this principle?"
> 3. **Check for contradictions**: "Would my maxim undermine itself if everyone followed it?"
> 4. **Verify respect for persons**: "Does my maxim treat people as ends, not merely means?"
> 
> This process reveals why certain maxims fail the moral test:
> 
> |Maxim|Universalization Problem|
> |---|---|
> |"I will make false promises when convenient"|A world of universal promise-breaking makes promising itself impossible|
> |"I will use others' labor but never contribute"|If universalized, no one would work and society would collapse|
> |"I will develop my talents only when it benefits me"|No logical contradiction, but fails to respect rational nature|
> 
> Through this testing process, we transform ethics from subjective preferences to rational principles that any thinking being would acknowledge as valid.
