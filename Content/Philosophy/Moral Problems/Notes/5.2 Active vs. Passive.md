> [!motivation] Is There a Moral Difference?
> 
> Active and passive euthanasia represent two distinct approaches to ending life:
> 
> - **Active euthanasia**: Deliberately taking action to end a patient's life (e.g., administering lethal medication)
> - **Passive euthanasia**: Allowing death to occur by withholding treatment or life support
> 
> These distinctions are clear in practice, but raise profound moral questions:
> 
> - Is there a fundamental moral difference between killing and letting die?
> - Does the intention behind the act matter more than the action itself?
> - Can withholding treatment be just as causally responsible for death as direct intervention?

> [!consider] American Medical Association and the Difference Thesis
> 
> The American Medical Association (AMA) has historically maintained a clear distinction between active and passive euthanasia:
> 
> **AMA Position**:
> 
> - Active euthanasia is never permitted
> - Passive euthanasia may be permissible in certain circumstances
> 
> **Justification for this view**:
> 
> - Action vs. inaction: Direct killing violates medical ethics, while allowing natural death does not
> - Intent: In passive cases, death is foreseen but not directly intended
> - Causation: In passive cases, the disease is seen as the cause of death, not the physician
> 
> **Practical implications**:
> 
> - Physicians may withdraw life-sustaining treatment
> - Physicians may not administer lethal drugs
> 
> Critics argue this distinction creates arbitrary boundaries and may actually increase suffering in some cases where passive means lead to prolonged dying.


> [!consider] James Rachels and the Equivalence Thesis
> 
> Philosopher James Rachels challenges the moral distinction between active and passive euthanasia in his influential 1975 paper "Active and Passive Euthanasia."
> 
> **Rachels' Key Stance**: Active euthanasia is at least no worse than passive euthanasia, and sometimes morally preferable. The distinction between them is not morally significant.
> 
> **Argument 1: The Mercy Argument**
> 
> Once the decision for euthanasia has been made, active methods often reduce suffering more effectively than passive methods.
> 
> Logical structure (Modus Ponens)
> 
> - P1: If act A is more merciful than act B, then A is both morally permissible and preferable to B
> - P2: Active euthanasia is sometimes more merciful than passive euthanasia
> - C: Active euthanasia is sometimes morally permissible/preferable to passive euthanasia
> 
> Example: A patient with terminal throat cancer who will die either way suffers less from a lethal injection than from dehydration and starvation if feeding is withdrawn.
