> [!motivation] Is There a Moral Difference?
> 
> Active and passive euthanasia represent two distinct approaches to ending life:
> 
> - **Active euthanasia**: Deliberately taking action to end a patient's life (e.g., administering lethal medication)
> - **Passive euthanasia**: Allowing death to occur by withholding treatment or life support
> 
> These distinctions are clear in practice, but raise profound moral questions:
> 
> - Is there a fundamental moral difference between killing and letting die?
> - Does the intention behind the act matter more than the action itself?
> - Can withholding treatment be just as causally responsible for death as direct intervention?

> [!consider] American Medical Association and the Difference Thesis
> 
> The American Medical Association (AMA) has historically maintained a clear distinction between active and passive euthanasia:
> 
> **AMA Position**:
> 
> - Active euthanasia is never permitted
> - Passive euthanasia may be permissible in certain circumstances
> 
> **Justification for this view**:
> 
> - Action vs. inaction: Direct killing violates medical ethics, while allowing natural death does not
> - Intent: In passive cases, death is foreseen but not directly intended
> - Causation: In passive cases, the disease is seen as the cause of death, not the physician
> 
> **Practical implications**:
> 
> - Physicians may withdraw life-sustaining treatment
> - Physicians may not administer lethal drugs
> 
> Critics argue this distinction creates arbitrary boundaries and may actually increase suffering in some cases where passive means lead to prolonged dying.

> [!consider] James Rachels and the Equivalence Thesis
> 
> Philosopher James Rachels challenges the moral distinction between active and passive euthanasia in his influential 1975 paper "Active and Passive Euthanasia."
> 
> **Rachels' Key Arguments**:
> 
> **1. The Smith and Jones Thought Experiment**
> 
> - Smith drowns his young cousin in the bathtub to gain inheritance
> - Jones plans the same, but finds the cousin already drowning and merely watches
> - Both had identical intentions and outcomes
> - Intuitively, both seem equally wrong morally
> 
> **2. Consequences Matter More Than Methods**
> 
> - If death has been determined to be in patient's best interest, active methods may cause less suffering
> - Passive methods (e.g., withdrawing nutrition) can lead to prolonged, painful deaths
> - Example: A patient with throat cancer allowed to dehydrate vs. quick lethal injection
> 
> **3. Logical Inconsistency in Traditional View**
> 
> - If we decide it's permissible to end a life, the means should be the most humane
> - The active/passive distinction often serves as psychological comfort for doctors rather than benefiting patients
> 
> **4. The Real Moral Question**
> 
> - Whether life should be terminated at all is the fundamental decision
> - Once that decision is made, the method should minimize suffering
> 
> Rachels concludes active euthanasia is at least no worse than passive euthanasia and in many cases morally preferable when it reduces suffering.
