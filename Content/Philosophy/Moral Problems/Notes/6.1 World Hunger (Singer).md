> [!motivation] World Hunger
> 
> World hunger is a widespread and persistent global issue affecting millions. Despite sufficient global food production, substantial populations face chronic undernutrition and food insecurity.
> 
> - **Scale**: Approximately 9% of the global population (700+ million people) experience chronic hunger.
>     
> - **Consequences**: Leads to severe health issues, economic instability, and impedes social development, disproportionately impacting developing countries.
>     
> 
> |Region|Undernourished (%)|Affected Population|
> |---|---|---|
> |Africa|20%|~250 million|
> |Asia|8.6%|~418 million|
> |Latin America|7%|~42 million|
> 
> The persistence and severity of world hunger raise crucial ethical questions: **Do individuals, governments, or affluent societies have a moral obligation to aid the world's poor?** If so, how strong or binding is this obligation? Alternatively, should such aid be viewed merely as charitable generosity rather than a duty of justice?

> [!consider] Justice vs. Charity
> 
> Distinguishing between charity and justice is essential for addressing ethical obligations towards global poverty.
> 
> - Justice involves **actions owed as moral or ethical duties**. Failing to act justly constitutes wrongdoing or injustice.
>     
> - Charity refers to **voluntary giving or assistance beyond moral obligations**. Charity is commendable but not ethically mandatory.
>     
> 
> The ethical debate on world hunger revolves around classifying aid as justice (mandatory ethical duty) or charity (optional generosity).

> [!idea] Singer's View in _Famine, Affluence, and Morality_
> 
> Singer argues that **affluent individuals have a strong moral obligation to assist those suffering from hunger and poverty**, asserting that failing to prevent severe suffering when we can do so easily is **morally equivalent to causing harm directly**.
> 
> - **The Strong Sacrifice Principle**: If it is within our power to prevent severe harm without sacrificing something of comparable moral significance, we ought morally to do so.
>     
> - **Reasoning (Drowning Child Analogy)**: Singer illustrates this principle with a thought experiment: if you pass by a shallow pond and see a child drowning, you morally ought to save the child, even if doing so ruins your clothes. Since the child's life greatly outweighs the minor inconvenience of replacing clothing, failing to act is ethically comparable to deliberately causing harm. Singer argues that this reasoning equally applies to global poverty—distance or indirectness does not diminish moral responsibility.
>     
> 
> Singer is an act utilitarian, but his central premise does not rely on utilitarianism. Instead, he appeals directly to existing moral intuitions to demonstrate consistency in ethical reasoning, suggesting we should already be committed to aiding the global poor.

> [!consider] Defining Affluence
> 
> Singer broadly defines "affluence" as possessing resources beyond what is necessary for basic survival or meeting essential needs. According to this view, nearly all individuals living above subsistence levels are affluent.
> 
> - **Implication**: This definition implies that moral obligations extend widely, encompassing even those who consider themselves only modestly comfortable rather than wealthy.
>     
> - **Consideration**: This expansive view prompts critical reflection on whether such a stringent criterion accurately captures moral responsibility or requires reevaluation to align better with common understandings of affluence.
>

> [!idea] The Weak Sacrifice Principle
> 
> In response to the demanding implications of the Strong Sacrifice Principle (SSP), Singer proposes a less stringent version: the Weak Sacrifice Principle (WSP). It aims to preserve the core ethical insight while making the obligations more psychologically and socially manageable.
> 
> - **WSP Definition**: If we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything morally significant, we ought to do it.
>     
> - **Context**: Singer recognizes that many reject the SSP due to its extreme implications—e.g., requiring near-total donation of surplus income, minimal consumption, and a radical shift in lifestyle for those in affluent societies.
>     
> - **Purpose**: The WSP reduces the threshold for action, allowing for moral obligations that are still demanding but less radically disruptive.
>     
> 
> |Principle|Requirement|Practical Implication|
> |---|---|---|
> |Strong|Sacrifice up to the point of comparable moral cost|Drastic lifestyle reduction|
> |Weak|Sacrifice only things not morally significant (of our own standard) |Moderate giving; more achievable standard|

> [!consider] Implications of Singer's Principles
> 
> Singer's argument leads to several key ethical implications regarding moral responsibility towards others:
> 
> - **Geographical Proximity is Irrelevant**:  
>     Just as being far away does not reduce your obligation to save a distant child drowning in a pond, physical distance does not lessen moral responsibility towards suffering individuals globally.
>     
> - **Relationship or Feelings are Irrelevant**:  
>     The obligation to save the drowning child exists irrespective of personal attachment or aversion. Similarly, personal feelings toward those in need—positive or negative—do not diminish or enhance moral responsibility.
>     
> - **Others' Actions Do Not Excuse Inaction**:  
>     Even if others refuse to assist the drowning child, you remain morally obligated to help. Likewise, individuals maintain ethical duties to alleviate suffering regardless of others' participation or lack thereof.

> [!idea] Singer's Master Argument (Formalized)
> 
> **Premise 1**:  
> If it is in our power to prevent famine deaths without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant, then we are morally obligated to do so.  
> _Justification_: Weak Sacrifice Principle (WSP)
> 
> **Premise 2**:  
> It is in our power to prevent famine deaths without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant.  
> _Justification_: Empirical observation—affluent individuals clearly possess sufficient resources; even those of modest means typically have capacity beyond current contributions.
> 
> **Conclusion**:  
> Therefore, we are morally obligated to prevent famine deaths by contributing resources to alleviate global hunger.

> [!consider] The Fair Share Objection
> 
> The Fair Share objection argues that Singer's approach places an unfair burden on individuals who actively help, especially when many others fail to contribute equally.
> 
> - **Core Idea**: Individuals should only be morally required to contribute their fair share towards alleviating global poverty—not to compensate for others' inactivity.
>     
> - **Contextual Example**: Returning to the drowning child scenario, if multiple people are present, some argue each has an equal responsibility to help. It appears unfair if only one person is repeatedly obligated to act because others refuse.
>     
> 
> **Singer's Counterargument**:  
> Singer acknowledges fairness ideally implies each person contributes equally, but stresses this rarely occurs in practice. Imagine four drowning children and three adults passing by. It's fair each adult saves one child, but what happens to the fourth child? According to Singer, the moral duty remains: **unfairness in distribution does not absolve the obligation to prevent suffering.**
