> [!consider] Three Possible Positions on Helping Starvation Victims
> 
> - **Moral Obligation**: There is a duty to assist those facing starvation, making non-intervention ethically wrong.
>     
> - **Charity, Not Duty**: Helping is not an obligation but remains a morally good and permissible act. Failure to do so is not deemed wrong.
>     
> - **Questioning Permissibility**: Some assert no obligation to help and challenge whether aiding constitutes a truly permissible act, often citing concerns about unintended consequences or misdirected assistance.
