> [!motivation] A Valuable Action
> 
> When examining moral philosophy, we need to determine what makes actions truly good or valuable. Many evaluate actions based on their outcomes or adherence to rules, but these approaches face problems with inconsistent results and arbitrary standards.
> 
> - External factors can influence outcomes, making consequence-based judgments unreliable
> - Rule-based frameworks struggle to resolve conflicts between competing rules
> - Both approaches fail to account for the inner quality that gives actions their moral worth
> 
> This raises a fundamental question: what is the source of moral value in human actions?

> [!idea] The Good Will
> 
> The good will is the only thing that can be considered good without qualification. It derives its goodness not from effects produced or goals achieved, but from its inherent nature.
> 
> - Unlike talents, traits, or gifts which can be used for harmful purposes, a good will remains good regardless of circumstances
> - It maintains its value even when prevented from achieving its intended outcome
> 
> A good will acts from duty rather than inclination, with actions gaining moral worth when done because they are right, not merely in accordance with what is right.

> [!example] Example of Good Will
> 
> Consider two shopkeepers who both charge fair prices and refuse to overcharge customers:
> 
> - **Shopkeeper A** charges fair prices solely because it's good for businessâ€”customers return when treated fairly, and the shop maintains a positive reputation.
>     
> - **Shopkeeper B** charges fair prices primarily because they believe it's the right thing to do, regardless of whether it benefits business.
>     
> 
> According to the concept of good will, only Shopkeeper B's actions have genuine moral worth. Both perform the same action with identical outcomes, but the motivation differs fundamentally.
> 
> |Aspect|Shopkeeper A|Shopkeeper B|
> |---|---|---|
> |Action|Charges fair prices|Charges fair prices|
> |Motivation|Self-interest|Moral duty|
> |Moral worth|Minimal|Significant|
> 
> This example illustrates that good will depends not on the consequences of actions but on whether actions are performed from a sense of moral duty rather than self-interest or inclination.
