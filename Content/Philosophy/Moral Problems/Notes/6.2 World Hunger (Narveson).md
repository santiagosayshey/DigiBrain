> [!motivation] Moral Landscape After Singer
> 
> Singer's discussion on world hunger introduces a moral dilemma with multiple responses. These responses reflect contrasting views about whether helping those suffering from famine is morally **required**, **optional**, or **impermissible**.
> 
> - One view claims individuals are **morally required** to assist — inaction is wrong.
>     
> - Another holds that helping is **not required**, but is still **morally good and encouraged**.
>     
> - A third rejects both obligation and moral permission, seeing intervention as potentially **impermissible**.

> |View|Moral Status of Helping|Held By|
> |---|---|---|
> |Helping is a moral obligation|Required|Singer|
> |Helping is charitable and allowed|Optional and praiseworthy|Narveson|
> |Helping is not morally permissible|Rejected|Hardin|
> 
> These distinctions frame the ethical debate on whether — and how — individuals should respond to global hunger.

> [!consider] Hardin’s View: Future Consequences of Helping
> 
> Hardin argues that feeding the hungry now may lead to greater suffering in the future due to resource scarcity and population growth.
> 
> - Providing aid can enable unsustainable population growth in regions already facing ecological limits.
>     
> - This increases pressure on finite resources (food, land, water), leading to more severe crises later.
>     
> - Helping now may delay short-term suffering, but results in a larger, long-term catastrophe.
