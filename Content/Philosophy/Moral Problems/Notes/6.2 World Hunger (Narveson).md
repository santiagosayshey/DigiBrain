> [!motivation] Moral Landscape After Singer
> 
> Singer's discussion on world hunger introduces a moral dilemma with multiple responses. These responses reflect contrasting views about whether helping those suffering from famine is morally **required**, **optional**, or **impermissible**.
> 
> - One view claims individuals are **morally required** to assist — inaction is wrong.
>     
> - Another holds that helping is **not required**, but is still **morally good and encouraged**.
>     
> - A third rejects both obligation and moral permission, seeing intervention as potentially **impermissible**.
>     
> 
> |View|Moral Status of Helping|Held By|
> |---|---|---|
> |Helping is a moral obligation|Required|Singer|
> |Helping is charitable and allowed|Optional and praiseworthy|Narveson|
> |Helping is not morally permissible|Rejected|Hardin|
> 
> These distinctions frame the ethical debate on whether — and how — individuals should respond to global hunger.

> [!consider] Hardin’s View: Future Consequences of Helping
> 
> Hardin argues that **feeding the hungry now may lead to greater suffering in the future** due to resource scarcity and population growth.
> 
> - Providing aid can enable unsustainable population growth in regions already facing ecological limits.
>     
> - This increases pressure on finite resources (food, land, water), leading to more severe crises later.
>     
> - Helping now may delay short-term suffering, but results in a larger, long-term catastrophe.

> [!consider] Narveson's Two Questions Narveson asks two key questions regarding the ethics of helping the hungry:
> 
> 1. Is helping the hungry a requirement of **justice** or an act of **charity**?
> 2. Does justice require that we help, or merely allow helping if people are so inclined?
> 
> These questions frame Narveson's exploration of the moral status of providing aid.

> [!consider] Justice vs Charity: Narveson's Definitions Narveson distinguishes between justice and charity:
> 
> - **Justice**: What we owe to others and can be compelled to provide. It's about entitlements and rights.
> - **Charity**: Voluntary help that goes beyond the requirements of justice. It's praiseworthy but not obligatory.
> 
> This differs from common usage where justice is about fairness and charity is synonymous with aid. For Narveson, the key issue is whether helping is required or optional.

> [!idea] Narveson's View: Helping the Hungry is Charity, Not Justice Narveson argues that helping the hungry is an act of charity rather than a requirement of justice:
> 
> - We have **negative duties** not to harm others, but no **positive duties** to help them.
> - The hungry don't have a **right** to our aid or an **entitlement** to our resources just because they need them.
> - Helping is thus **beyond the call of duty** — it's virtuous and admirable, but optional.
> - Forcing people to help, through taxation for example, would violate their rights.
> 
> In sum, Narveson sees helping the hungry as supererogatory — morally good but not morally required. Justice permits us to help if we choose, but doesn't demand it.
