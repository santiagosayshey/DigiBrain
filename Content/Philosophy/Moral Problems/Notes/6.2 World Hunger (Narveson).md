> [!motivation] Moral Landscape After Singer
> 
> Singer's discussion on world hunger introduces a moral dilemma with multiple responses. These responses reflect contrasting views about whether helping those suffering from famine is morally **required**, **optional**, or **impermissible**.
> 
> - One view claims individuals are **morally required** to assist — inaction is wrong.
>     
> - Another holds that helping is **not required**, but is still **morally good and encouraged**.
>     
> - A third rejects both obligation and moral permission, seeing intervention as potentially **impermissible**.
>     
> 
> |View|Moral Status of Helping|Held By|
> |---|---|---|
> |Helping is a moral obligation|Required|Singer|
> |Helping is charitable and allowed|Optional and praiseworthy|Narveson|
> |Helping is not morally permissible|Rejected|Hardin|
> 
> These distinctions frame the ethical debate on whether — and how — individuals should respond to global hunger.

> [!consider] Hardin’s View: Future Consequences of Helping
> 
> Hardin argues that **feeding the hungry now may lead to greater suffering in the future** due to resource scarcity and population growth.
> 
> - Providing aid can enable unsustainable population growth in regions already facing ecological limits.
>     
> - This increases pressure on finite resources (food, land, water), leading to more severe crises later.
>     
> - Helping now may delay short-term suffering, but results in a larger, long-term catastrophe.

> [!idea] Narveson’s View: Duties and Dispositions
> 
> Narveson frames the morality of helping the starving around two guiding questions:
> 
> - **Is there a basic duty to feed the starving?**
>     
> - **Is there a basic requirement of charity that we be disposed to feed them?**
>     
> 
> His answer to both is **no** — individuals are not morally obligated to help, and charity is not a moral requirement.
> 
> - Moral obligations arise from **contracts or agreements**, not needs alone.
>     
> - Helping may be **admirable**, but it is **not required** — failing to help is **not immoral**.
>     
> - Charitable acts are based on **personal values**, not universal duties.
>     
> 
> |Question|Narveson’s Position|
> |---|---|
> |Duty to feed?|No — there is no inherent moral obligation|
> |Required charity?|No — charity is optional, not morally mandated|

> [!consider] Narveson: Justice vs. Charity
> 
> Narveson distinguishes justice from charity to clarify moral expectations.
> 
> - **Justice** concerns what we are required to do based on mutual agreements or rights.
>     
> - **Charity** concerns what we may choose to do out of goodwill, but are not obligated to.
>     
> - Not helping the starving may be unkind, but it is not unjust unless a right is violated.
