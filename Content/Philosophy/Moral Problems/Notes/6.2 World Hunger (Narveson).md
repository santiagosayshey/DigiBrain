> [!motivation] Moral Landscape After Singer
> 
> Singer's discussion on world hunger introduces a moral dilemma with multiple responses. These responses reflect contrasting views about whether helping those suffering from famine is morally **required**, **optional**, or **impermissible**.
> 
> - One view claims individuals are **morally required** to assist — inaction is wrong.
>     
> - Another holds that helping is **not required**, but is still **morally good and encouraged**.
>     
> - A third rejects both obligation and moral permission, seeing intervention as potentially **impermissible**.
>     
> 
> |View|Moral Status of Helping|Held By|
> |---|---|---|
> |Helping is a moral obligation|Required|Singer|
> |Helping is charitable and allowed|Optional and praiseworthy|Narveson|
> |Helping is not morally permissible|Rejected|Hardin|
> 
> These distinctions frame the ethical debate on whether — and how — individuals should respond to global hunger.

> [!consider] Hardin’s View: Future Consequences of Helping
> 
> Hardin argues that **feeding the hungry now may lead to greater suffering in the future** due to resource scarcity and population growth.
> 
> - Providing aid can enable unsustainable population growth in regions already facing ecological limits.
>     
> - This increases pressure on finite resources (food, land, water), leading to more severe crises later.
>     
> - Helping now may delay short-term suffering, but results in a larger, long-term catastrophe.
>     

> [!consider] Narveson's Two Questions
> 
> Narveson poses two key questions regarding the ethics of helping the hungry:
> 1. Is there a basic duty to feed the starving?
> 2. Is there a basic requirement that we be disposed to feed the starving?
>
> These questions aim to explore whether helping the hungry is a moral obligation or a voluntary act of kindness. Narveson seeks to determine if we are ethically compelled to provide aid or if it is a matter of personal choice.

> [!consider] Justice vs Charity: Narveson's Definitions
>
> Narveson distinguishes between justice and charity:
> - **Justice**: Things we should be forced to do if necessary. It involves actions that are morally required and can be legitimately enforced.
> - **Charity**: Things that come from the heart. It encompasses voluntary acts of kindness and generosity that are not morally obligatory.
>
> This distinction deviates from common usage, where justice is typically associated with things that we ought to (morally) do, not just things that can be enforced. 

> [!idea] Narveson's View: Helping the Starving is a Matter of Charity, Not Justice
>
> Narveson argues that **helping the starving is an act of charity rather than a matter of justice:**
> - He contends that we have negative duties not to harm others but no positive duties to assist them.
> - The starving do not have a rightful claim or entitlement to our resources simply because they are in need.
> - Providing aid to the hungry is thus a voluntary act of benevolence that goes beyond the requirements of justice.
> - Compelling people to help, such as through taxation, would infringe upon their individual rights.
>
> In essence, Narveson asserts that while helping the starving is morally commendable, it is not morally obligatory. Justice allows us the freedom to choose whether to provide assistance, but it does not dictate that we must do so.
