> [!motivation] Moral Landscape After Singer
> 
> Singer's discussion on world hunger introduces a moral dilemma with multiple responses. These responses reflect contrasting views about whether helping those suffering from famine is morally **required**, **optional**, or **impermissible**.
> 
> - One view claims individuals are **morally required** to assist — inaction is wrong.
>     
> - Another holds that helping is **not required**, but is still **morally good and encouraged**.
>     
> - A third rejects both obligation and moral permission, seeing intervention as potentially **impermissible**.
>     
> 
> |View|Moral Status of Helping|Held By|
> |---|---|---|
> |Helping is a moral obligation|Required|Singer|
> |Helping is charitable and allowed|Optional and praiseworthy|Narveson|
> |Helping is not morally permissible|Rejected|Hardin|
> 
> These distinctions frame the ethical debate on whether — and how — individuals should respond to global hunger.

> [!consider] Hardin’s View: Future Consequences of Helping
> 
> Hardin argues that **feeding the hungry now may lead to greater suffering in the future** due to resource scarcity and population growth.
> 
> - Providing aid can enable unsustainable population growth in regions already facing ecological limits.
>     
> - This increases pressure on finite resources (food, land, water), leading to more severe crises later.
>     
> - Helping now may delay short-term suffering, but results in a larger, long-term catastrophe.
>     

> [!consider] Narveson's Two Questions
> 
> Narveson poses two key questions regarding the ethics of helping the hungry:
> 1. Is there a basic duty to feed the starving?
> 2. Is there a basic requirement that we be disposed to feed the starving?
>
> These questions aim to explore whether helping the hungry is a moral obligation or a voluntary act of kindness. Narveson seeks to determine if we are ethically compelled to provide aid or if it is a matter of personal choice.

> [!consider] Justice vs Charity: Narveson's Definitions
>
> Narveson distinguishes between justice and charity:
> - **Justice**: Things we should be forced to do if necessary. It involves actions that are morally required and can be legitimately enforced.
> - **Charity**: Things that come from the heart. It encompasses voluntary acts of kindness and generosity that are not morally obligatory.
>
> This distinction deviates from common usage, where justice is typically associated with things that we ought to (morally) do, not just things that can be enforced. 

> [!idea] Narveson's View: Helping the Starving is a Matter of Charity, Not Justice
>
> Narveson argues that **helping the starving is an act of charity rather than a matter of justice:**
> - He contends that we have negative duties not to harm others but no positive duties to assist them.
> - The starving do not have a rightful claim or entitlement to our resources simply because they are in need.
> - Providing aid to the hungry is thus a voluntary act of benevolence that goes beyond the requirements of justice.
> - Compelling people to help, such as through taxation, would infringe upon their individual rights.
>
> In essence, Narveson asserts that while helping the starving is morally commendable, it is not morally obligatory. Justice allows us the freedom to choose whether to provide assistance, but it does not dictate that we must do so.

> [!consider] Arguments for a Duty to Feed the Starving
> 
> **Two arguments suggest we have an obligation** to help the starving:
> 
> 1. **The Hunger Equivalence Argument**:
>     - It claims that actively starving someone and passively letting them starve are morally equivalent.
>     - If starving someone is wrong, then letting them starve must also be wrong.
> 1. **The Equal Satisfactions Argument**:
>     - It holds that everyone's happiness counts equally and we should maximize overall utility (well-being).
>     - Helping the starving would greatly increase their happiness at little cost to us.
>     - Therefore, we are obligated to help.
> 
> **Narveson rejects both of these** arguments for a duty to feed the starving.

> [!idea] The Hunger Equivalence Argument
>
> The hunger equivalence argument aims to establish a duty to feed the starving:
>
> - P1: If starving someone is wrong, then letting someone starve is also wrong.
>   - Justification: Starving someone and letting them starve are morally equivalent.
> - P2: Starving someone is wrong.
> - C: Therefore, letting someone starve is also wrong.
>
> Narveson rejects P1 of this argument based on the liberty view of ethics:
>
> - The liberty view holds that we should not interfere with the lives of others. 
> - If we do interfere and cause harm, we have a duty to right those wrongs.
> - Causing someone to starve would violate their liberty, and we would be obligated to help them.
> - But **merely allowing people to starve who are already starving through no fault of our own does not violate their liberty.**
> - So as long as we did not cause the starvation, we have not infringed on anyone's liberty and thus have no duty to render aid.
>
> On Narveson's view, the hunger equivalence argument **fails because starving someone and letting them starve are not actually equivalent on the liberty view**. Only the former violates liberty and creates obligations.

Here is the idea callout for the Equal Satisfactions Argument:

> [!idea] The Equal Satisfactions Argument
> 
> The equal satisfactions argument claims we have a duty to help the starving because:
>
> - Everyone's happiness and well-being (their "satisfactions") matter equally from an impartial perspective. 
>
> Applied to world hunger, this argument suggests:  
>
> - The huge benefit starving people would get from being fed far outweighs the small satisfaction we would lose by giving up some of our wealth.
>
> However, Narveson rejects this argument:
>
> - It would make us "slaves to the poor" by requiring us to keep giving until we ourselves become poor.
> - There will always be people worse off than us, so as long as helping produces any net satisfaction gain, the argument demands we help. 
> - We would have to keep aiding others until we reduced ourselves to their level, since only then would further transfers stop generating overall satisfaction increases.  
> - This leaves us no room to permissibly pursue our own projects and priorities. Our lives become entirely about serving the poor.
> - Narveson thinks this goes too far by completely overriding our liberty and legitimate partiality to our own satisfactions.
>
> While the equal satisfactions argument sees helping the poor as an impartial obligation, Narveson contends it **fails to respect the separateness of persons and the validity of giving some extra weight to our own interests**. We are not mere satisfaction generators but individuals with our own lives to lead.
