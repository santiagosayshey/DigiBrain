> [!motivation] The Search for Moral Evaluation
> 
> A fundamental challenge in ethics is determining **how to evaluate our actions**. We constantly make choices that affect ourselves and others, but what framework should guide these decisions? How can we objectively determine if an action is "good" or "right"? This question is essential because it underpins moral reasoning and ethical decision-making.
> 
> Key questions this framework addresses:
> 
> - How do we measure the moral worth of our actions?
> - What criteria should determine whether an action is ethically justified?
> - Is there an objective way to evaluate competing ethical claims?

> [!idea] Utilitarianism
> 
> Utilitarianism **evaluates actions based solely on their consequences**, specifically the amount of happiness or utility they produce. An action is right if it produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.
> 
> Core principles:
> 
> - **Consequentialism**: Only the outcomes of actions matter morally
> - **Welfarism**: The only relevant outcome is human welfare or happiness
> - **Impartiality**: Everyone's happiness counts equally
> 
> |Key Figures|Core Contribution|
> |---|---|
> |Jeremy Bentham|Original formulation focusing on quantity of pleasure|
> |John Stuart Mill|Quality distinction between "higher" and "lower" pleasures|
> |Peter Singer|Applied utilitarianism to modern ethical problems|

> [!idea] Extreme Utilitarianism
> 
> Extreme (or act) utilitarianism **evaluates each individual action solely on whether it maximizes utility in that specific instance**, regardless of rules, rights, or other considerations.
> 
> Characteristics:
> 
> - No action is inherently wrong; even traditionally immoral acts could be justified if producing maximum utility
> - Requires constant calculation of consequences for every decision
> - Can lead to counter-intuitive conclusions where individual rights are sacrificed for greater utility
> 
> Challenges:
> 
> - Practical difficulty in calculating all consequences
> - May justify actions most consider deeply immoral if they produce sufficient utility
> - Cannot account for special obligations (family, promises, etc.)

> [!idea] Restricted Utilitarianism
> 
> Restricted (or rule) utilitarianism evaluates rules rather than individual actions, advocating for following rules that tend to promote the greatest happiness when generally observed.
> 
> Key features:
> 
> - Focuses on rules that maximize utility when followed consistently
> - Acknowledges practical limitations in calculating consequences of every action
> - Preserves common moral intuitions about rights and duties
> 
> Benefits:
> 
> - More practical for everyday decision-making
> - Better aligns with common moral intuitions
> - Provides stable guidelines that protect individual rights while still focusing on well-being

> [!example] Promise-Keeping Dilemma
> 
> Imagine you've promised to meet a friend for coffee, but on your way, you encounter someone in need of immediate assistance that would make you miss your appointment.
> 
> Act utilitarian analysis:
> 
> - Evaluates this specific instance only
> - Breaking the promise is justified if helping the person in need produces more overall happiness
> - No inherent value in promise-keeping itself beyond its consequences
> 
> Rule utilitarian analysis:
> 
> - Considers the utility of following the rule "keep your promises" in society
> - While breaking the promise might maximize utility in this case, a society where promises are routinely broken would decrease overall happiness
> - Might justify keeping the promise unless the emergency is severe enough
> 
> This example highlights the key distinction: act utilitarianism focuses on maximizing utility in each individual case, while rule utilitarianism considers what rules, when generally followed, would maximize utility across society.
