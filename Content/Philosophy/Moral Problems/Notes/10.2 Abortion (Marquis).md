| 1         | Motivation       | A Different View           | We want to directly reference the prior note and suggest just how contentious this topic is - it is one of, if not the, most contentious topics in all of medical ethics. Allude to the fact that there are more than 1 arguments here for multiple sides.                                                                                                                   |
| 2         | Consider         | Personhood Does Not Matter | Marquis thinks figuring out whether Fetuses are persons or not is a waste of time. Why? because doing so undermines each sides perspective (expand this, i didnt quite word it correctly, )                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3         | Consider         | What Does Matter?          | Marquis suggests we look at killing more broadly and figure out why it is wrong, then apply this to abortion.  <br><br>Marquis suggests that killing is wrong because it robs a person (what is a person is not important) of their future valued life. This specific explanation holds heuristically why not only killing is bad, but why we fear death in the first place. |
