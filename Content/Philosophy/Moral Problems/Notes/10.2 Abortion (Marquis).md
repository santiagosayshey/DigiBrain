| 1         | Motivation       | A Different View             | We want to directly reference the prior note and suggest just how contentious this topic is - it is one of, if not the, most contentious topics in all of medical ethics. Allude to the fact that there are more than 1 arguments here for multiple sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2         | Consider         | Personhood Does Not Matter   | Marquis thinks figuring out whether Fetuses are persons or not is a waste of time. Why? because doing so undermines each sides perspective (expand this, i didnt quite word it correctly, )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3         | Consider         | What Does Matter?            | Marquis suggests we look at killing more broadly and figure out why it is wrong, then apply this to abortion.  <br><br>Marquis suggests that killing is wrong because it robs a person (what is a person is not important) of their future valued life - future experiences, acitivities, projects, enjoyments, etc that would have otherwise continued. This specific explanation holds heuristically why not only killing is bad, but why we fear death in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4         | Idea             | The Future Like Ours Account | If depriving the average adult of a future of value is what makes it wrong to kill them, then marquis argues that it follows from this that depriving any individual with a relevantly similar future of value of that future also makes it wrong to kill it.<br><br>this has 4 major implications:<br>1. FLO is incompatible with the view that is wrong to kill only beings who are biologically human<br>2. it is possible that some non human animals have FLOs such that it is seriously morally wrong to kill them (like our pets)<br>3. FLO does not entail that active euthenasia is wrong - it might be permissable (doing so would be denying the antecedent - a formal fallacy)<br>4. FLO entails that it is seriously moirally wrong to kill children and infants because we think that they have FLOs |
| 5         | Idea             | Marquis' Master Argument     | FLO applies to fetuses, and so abortion is prima faciie morally wrong. We should also note that this applies to fetuses in general - not all would have this FLO but most would. <br><br>P1:  If a standard fetus has a FLO, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong. Justification is that since it is wrong to kill an adult with FLO, then it is also wrong for a fetus with FLO<br>P2: A standard fetus has a FLO<br>C: Abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6         | Consider         | The Contraception Objection  | Some suggest that this view says that contraception is wrong because it denies the FLO of any potential person. <br><br>Marquis disagrees and is not anti contraception because it is not our duty to CREATE FLOs, only protect the ones that already exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

> [!motivation] A Different View
>
> Warren's personhood argument represents just one approach to abortion ethics. The topic remains one of the most contentious issues in medical ethics, with multiple sophisticated philosophical arguments existing across different sides of the debate.
>
> **Beyond Simple Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice**
> The abortion discussion involves numerous philosophical positions employing different moral principles, definitions, and reasoning strategies. Some focus on personhood criteria, others examine rights conflicts, consequences, or duties.
>
> **An Alternative Framework**
> Philosopher Don Marquis offers a fundamentally different approach that challenges not only Warren's conclusions but her entire methodological foundation. Rather than debating personhood status, Marquis argues that Warren asks the wrong questions entirely.
>
> This alternative perspective demonstrates why abortion remains philosophically challenging and practically divisive—competing frameworks can lead to completely different moral conclusions using equally rigorous reasoning.

> [!consider] Personhood Does Not Matter
>
> Marquis argues that debating whether fetuses qualify as persons represents a fundamental waste of philosophical effort. This approach, he contends, systematically undermines both pro-choice and pro-life positions rather than resolving the moral question.
>
> **The Problem with Personhood Debates**
> Focusing on personhood criteria creates several philosophical dead ends:
> - Pro-choice advocates must defend increasingly narrow definitions of personhood that may exclude other vulnerable populations
> - Pro-life advocates must defend broad personhood criteria that may lead to counterintuitive conclusions about early embryonic stages
> - Both sides become trapped in definitional disputes rather than addressing the underlying moral principles
>
> **Undermining Each Side's Perspective**
> The personhood framework forces each position into defensive stances that weaken their core moral insights:
> - Pro-choice positions risk appearing to devalue human life by setting high personhood bars
> - Pro-life positions risk appearing inconsistent when personhood criteria yield uncomfortable implications
>
> **A Methodological Critique**
> Rather than asking "What makes something a person?" Marquis suggests this entire line of inquiry diverts attention from more fundamental questions about the nature of moral wrongs. The personhood debate, in his view, obscures rather than illuminates the moral issues at stake in abortion.

> [!consider] What Does Matter?
>
> Instead of debating personhood, Marquis proposes examining killing more broadly to understand why it constitutes a moral wrong, then applying this understanding to abortion.
>
> **The Future of Value Account**
> Marquis argues that killing is wrong because it deprives individuals of their **future of value**—the continuation of experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments that would have otherwise occurred. This deprivation represents the fundamental harm of killing.
>
> **Key Components of Future Value:**
> - Ongoing experiences and sensations
> - Personal projects and goals
> - Relationships and connections
> - Achievements and accomplishments
> - Pleasures and satisfactions
>
> **Explanatory Power**
> This account explains not only why killing is morally wrong but also why death is feared and considered harmful. The loss isn't primarily about ending current consciousness or personhood status—it's about eliminating all the valuable future experiences that would have occurred.
>
> **Methodological Shift**
> Rather than asking "What makes someone a person worthy of protection?" Marquis asks "What makes killing wrong?" This reframes the entire abortion debate around the concept of valuable futures rather than personhood criteria, offering a different foundation for moral analysis.
