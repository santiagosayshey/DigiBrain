 
> [!motivation] A Different View
>
> Warren's personhood argument represents just one approach to abortion ethics. The topic remains one of the most contentious issues in medical ethics, with multiple sophisticated philosophical arguments existing across different sides of the debate.
>
> **Beyond Simple Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice**
> The abortion discussion involves numerous philosophical positions employing different moral principles, definitions, and reasoning strategies. Some focus on personhood criteria, others examine rights conflicts, consequences, or duties.
>
> **An Alternative Framework**
> Philosopher Don Marquis offers a fundamentally different approach that challenges not only Warren's conclusions but her entire methodological foundation. Rather than debating personhood status, Marquis argues that Warren asks the wrong questions entirely.
>
> This alternative perspective demonstrates why abortion remains philosophically challenging and practically divisive—competing frameworks can lead to completely different moral conclusions using equally rigorous reasoning.

> [!consider] Personhood Does Not Matter
>
> Marquis argues that debating whether fetuses qualify as persons represents a fundamental waste of philosophical effort. This approach, he contends, systematically undermines both pro-choice and pro-life positions rather than resolving the moral question.
>
> **The Problem with Personhood Debates**
> Focusing on personhood criteria creates several philosophical dead ends:
> - Pro-choice advocates must defend increasingly narrow definitions of personhood that may exclude other vulnerable populations
> - Pro-life advocates must defend broad personhood criteria that may lead to counterintuitive conclusions about early embryonic stages
> - Both sides become trapped in definitional disputes rather than addressing the underlying moral principles
>
> **Undermining Each Side's Perspective**
> The personhood framework forces each position into defensive stances that weaken their core moral insights:
> - Pro-choice positions risk appearing to devalue human life by setting high personhood bars
> - Pro-life positions risk appearing inconsistent when personhood criteria yield uncomfortable implications
>
> **A Methodological Critique**
> Rather than asking "What makes something a person?" Marquis suggests this entire line of inquiry diverts attention from more fundamental questions about the nature of moral wrongs. The personhood debate, in his view, obscures rather than illuminates the moral issues at stake in abortion.

> [!consider] What Does Matter?
>
> Instead of debating personhood, Marquis proposes examining killing more broadly to understand why it constitutes a moral wrong, then applying this understanding to abortion.
>
> **The Future of Value Account**
> Marquis argues that killing is wrong because it deprives individuals of their **future of value**—the continuation of experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments that would have otherwise occurred. This deprivation represents the fundamental harm of killing.
>
> **Key Components of Future Value:**
> - Ongoing experiences and sensations
> - Personal projects and goals
> - Relationships and connections
> - Achievements and accomplishments
> - Pleasures and satisfactions
>
> **Explanatory Power**
> This account explains not only why killing is morally wrong but also why death is feared and considered harmful. The loss isn't primarily about ending current consciousness or personhood status—it's about eliminating all the valuable future experiences that would have occurred.
>
> **Methodological Shift**
> Rather than asking "What makes someone a person worthy of protection?" Marquis asks "What makes killing wrong?" This reframes the entire abortion debate around the concept of valuable futures rather than personhood criteria, offering a different foundation for moral analysis.

> [!idea] The Future Like Ours Account
>
> If depriving adults of their future of value makes killing them wrong, then Marquis argues it follows that depriving **any individual** with a relevantly similar future of value of that future also makes killing wrong. This creates the "Future Like Ours" (FLO) account of the wrongness of killing.
>
> **The Logical Extension**
> The wrongness of killing doesn't depend on current personhood status but on possessing a valuable future similar to what typical humans experience. Any being with such a future deserves similar moral protection.
>
> **Four Major Implications:**
>
> **1. Beyond Biological Humanity**
> FLO is incompatible with restricting moral protection only to biologically human beings. The account focuses on future value, not species membership.
>
> **2. Non-Human Animals**
> Some non-human animals may possess FLOs that make killing them seriously morally wrong. Pets and other animals with rich future experiences could warrant significant moral protection.
>
> **3. Euthanasia Distinction**
> FLO doesn't necessarily prohibit active euthanasia. When someone's future lacks value or contains primarily suffering, ending their life might be permissible—this avoids the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent.
>
> **4. Children and Infants**
> FLO clearly applies to children and infants since they possess valuable futures, making their killing seriously morally wrong regardless of their current cognitive abilities.

> [!idea] Marquis' Master Argument
>
> Marquis applies the Future Like Ours account directly to abortion, constructing a logical argument that abortion is **prima facie** seriously morally wrong. His reasoning follows a straightforward syllogistic structure.
>
> **The Logical Structure:**
> - **Premise 1**: If a standard fetus has a Future Like Ours, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong
> - **Premise 2**: A standard fetus has a Future Like Ours  
> - **Conclusion**: Therefore, abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong
>
> **Justification for Premise 1**
> Since it's wrong to kill an adult who possesses a valuable future, consistency demands that it's also wrong to kill a fetus with the same type of valuable future. The moral principle operates identically regardless of the being's current developmental stage.
>
> **Understanding "Standard Fetus"**
> Marquis acknowledges that not all fetuses possess FLOs—some may have severe abnormalities that preclude valuable futures. However, the vast majority of fetuses ("standard fetuses") do possess futures filled with the same valuable experiences, relationships, and projects that make adult lives worth living.
>
> **Prima Facie Wrongness**
> The conclusion indicates abortion is prima facie wrong—morally wrong unless overridden by competing moral considerations. This allows for exceptions in extreme cases while maintaining that abortion generally constitutes a serious moral wrong comparable to killing adults.

> [!consider] The Contraception Objection
>
> Critics challenge Marquis's Future Like Ours account by arguing it leads to an absurd conclusion: **contraception becomes morally wrong** because it prevents potential persons from experiencing their valuable futures. If denying FLOs makes killing wrong, shouldn't preventing FLOs from existing also be wrong?
>
> **The Objection's Logic**
> Every act of contraception prevents a potential person who would have had a valuable future filled with experiences, relationships, and projects. If we're morally obligated to protect existing FLOs, why aren't we equally obligated to create new ones?
>
> **Marquis's Response: Creation vs. Protection**
> Marquis draws a crucial distinction between two types of moral duties:
> - **Duty to protect existing FLOs**: We have strong moral obligations not to destroy valuable futures that already exist
> - **No duty to create FLOs**: We have no moral obligation to bring new valuable futures into existence
>
> **The Moral Difference**
> Contraception prevents the creation of a new FLO, while abortion destroys an FLO that has already begun. Once a fetus exists with its potential future, we acquire a duty to protect that future. Before conception, no such duty exists because no individual with a future yet exists.
>
> **Preserving Intuitive Morality**
> This distinction allows Marquis to maintain his anti-abortion position while avoiding the counterintuitive conclusion that contraception is immoral, preserving common moral intuitions about reproductive autonomy.
