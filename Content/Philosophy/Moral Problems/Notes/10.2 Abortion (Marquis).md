| 1         | Motivation       | A Different View             | We want to directly reference the prior note and suggest just how contentious this topic is - it is one of, if not the, most contentious topics in all of medical ethics. Allude to the fact that there are more than 1 arguments here for multiple sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2         | Consider         | Personhood Does Not Matter   | Marquis thinks figuring out whether Fetuses are persons or not is a waste of time. Why? because doing so undermines each sides perspective (expand this, i didnt quite word it correctly, )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3         | Consider         | What Does Matter?            | Marquis suggests we look at killing more broadly and figure out why it is wrong, then apply this to abortion.  <br><br>Marquis suggests that killing is wrong because it robs a person (what is a person is not important) of their future valued life - future experiences, acitivities, projects, enjoyments, etc that would have otherwise continued. This specific explanation holds heuristically why not only killing is bad, but why we fear death in the first place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 4         | Idea             | The Future Like Ours Account | If depriving the average adult of a future of value is what makes it wrong to kill them, then marquis argues that it follows from this that depriving any individual with a relevantly similar future of value of that future also makes it wrong to kill it.<br><br>this has 4 major implications:<br>1. FLO is incompatible with the view that is wrong to kill only beings who are biologically human<br>2. it is possible that some non human animals have FLOs such that it is seriously morally wrong to kill them (like our pets)<br>3. FLO does not entail that active euthenasia is wrong - it might be permissable (doing so would be denying the antecedent - a formal fallacy)<br>4. FLO entails that it is seriously moirally wrong to kill children and infants because we think that they have FLOs |
| 5         | Idea             | Marquis' Master Argument     | FLO applies to fetuses, and so abortion is prima faciie morally wrong. We should also note that this applies to fetuses in general - not all would have this FLO but most would. <br><br>P1:  If a standard fetus has a FLO, then abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong. Justification is that since it is wrong to kill an adult with FLO, then it is also wrong for a fetus with FLO<br>P2: A standard fetus has a FLO<br>C: Abortion is prima facie seriously morally wrong                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6         | Consider         | The Contraception Objection  | Some suggest that this view says that contraception is wrong because it denies the FLO of any potential person. <br><br>Marquis disagrees and is not anti contraception because it is not our duty to CREATE FLOs, only protect the ones that already exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
