| 1         | Motivation       | A Different View             | We want to directly reference the prior note and suggest just how contentious this topic is - it is one of, if not the, most contentious topics in all of medical ethics. Allude to the fact that there are more than 1 arguments here for multiple sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2         | Consider         | Personhood Does Not Matter   | Marquis thinks figuring out whether Fetuses are persons or not is a waste of time. Why? because doing so undermines each sides perspective (expand this, i didnt quite word it correctly, )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 3         | Consider         | What Does Matter?            | Marquis suggests we look at killing more broadly and figure out why it is wrong, then apply this to abortion.  <br><br>Marquis suggests that killing is wrong because it robs a person (what is a person is not important) of their future valued life - future experiences, acitivities, projects, enjoyments, etc that would have otherwise continued. This specific explanation holds heuristically why not only killing is bad, but why we fear death in the first place. |
| 4         | Idea             | The Future Like Ours Account | If depriving the average adult of a future of value is what makes it wrong to kill them, then marquis argues that it follows from this that depriving any individual with a relevantly similar future of value of that future also makes it wrong to kill it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
