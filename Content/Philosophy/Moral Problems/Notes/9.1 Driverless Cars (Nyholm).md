## 1. Objective: Create Clear, Modular Notes

Hello! Let's create some notes on the topic specified below.

- **Topic for Notes:** Driver-less Cars (Nyholm)

I need these notes to be:

- **Concise & Modular:** Easy to digest in distinct blocks.
- **Focused on Key Ideas:** Highlight the core concepts for understanding.
- **Synthesized:** Please process and explain the information, not just copy text from sources.
- **Formatted with Callouts:** Structure the entire output using the 'callout' blocks defined below.
- **Iterative Process for Multiple Callouts:** If a table specifying multiple callouts is provided, we will work on **one callout at a time**. You will generate the first callout, I will review and confirm, and then we will proceed to the next.

**Do not** provide a preliminary outline or introduction. Generate the final formatted note directly (or the current callout if working iteratively).

## 2. Callout Formatting Guide

Structure the notes using 'callout' blocks. Each block starts with `>` on every line, with the first line defining the type and title:

```markdown
> [!callout_type] Title of Callout
>
> Content for the callout goes here.
> - Bullet points can be used for lists.
> Further explanations or details.
```

- **Titles:** Keep titles informative and brief (e.g., `Kruskal's Algorithm`, `Network Cost Problem`). Avoid generic placeholders like `Main Idea Here`.
- **Content:** Tailor the content within each callout based on its defined purpose (see section 3).

## 3. Callout Type Definitions

Here are the available callout types. Use them as appropriate for the content. The descriptions clarify the intended _purpose_ of each type:

### `> [!motivation] Motivation`

- **Purpose**: Sets the context. Introduce the problem, need, or scenario that the main topic addresses. _Do not include the solution itself here._
- **Elements**: Describe the challenge or situation; outline the specific issues needing resolution.
- **Example (MST Context)**: Minimizing cost (like cable length) when connecting multiple points in a network, while ensuring full connectivity, presents a common optimization challenge.

### `> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept`

- **Purpose**: Explains the core solution, definition, or algorithm.
- **Elements**: Clearly define the concept; describe how it works; link it back to solving the problem stated in the motivation.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Kruskal's Algorithm identifies a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in weighted, undirected graphs. It greedily adds the lowest-weight edge available that doesn't create a cycle, continuing until all vertices are connected.

### `> [!example] Example or Illustration`

- **Purpose**: Provides a concrete demonstration of the idea in action.
- **Elements**: Show a specific case, walk through steps, use diagrams (described), or illustrate the outcome. Explain _how_ the example demonstrates the concept.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Given a graph, Kruskal's first sorts edges by weight. It then adds edges like AB (weight 1), CD (weight 2), AC (weight 3), skipping edges like BD (weight 4) if adding it would form a cycle, until an MST is formed.

### `> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas`

- **Purpose**: Adds depth by exploring related topics, nuances, limitations, or advanced aspects.
- **Elements**: Discuss broader implications, related theories, implementation details (like data structures), edge cases, or variations.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Cycle detection in Kruskal's is often efficiently handled by a Union-Find data structure. The algorithm's time complexity is typically influenced by edge sorting and Union-Find operations (O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)). Consider Prim's algorithm as an alternative MST approach.

### `> [!summary] Summary of Key Concepts`

- **Purpose**: Briefly recap main points from previous callouts. **Only use when specifically requested.**
- **Format**: Use bullet points. Start each point with the **bolded topic** followed by a 1-2 sentence summary. Focus on _what_ the concepts are.
- **Good Example**:
    - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: A subset of edges connecting all vertices in a graph with the minimum possible total weight without cycles.
    - **Greedy Algorithm**: An approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each step; Kruskal's is an example.
- **Avoid**: Summarizing the structure of the notes themselves (e.g., "We discussed the motivation, then the idea...").

## 4. Allowed Formatting Within Callouts

You can enhance callouts with:

- **Tables**: Use standard Markdown.

```Markdown
| Algorithm | Complexity | Notes          |
| :-------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| Kruskal's | O(E log E) | Requires sorting |
| Prim's    | O(E log V) | Using Fibonacci heap |
```

- **Images**: Mark placement with a placeholder block. **Provide a clear description** of the desired image and use the Obsidian wikilink format `![[ImageName.png]]`.

```Code snippet
Description: Diagram comparing the edge selection process of Kruskal's vs Prim's algorithm on the same sample graph. Kruskal's focuses on global lowest edge, Prim's grows from a starting node.
![[kruskal_vs_prim_comparison.png]]
```

- **Math**: Use LaTeX delimiters.
    - Inline: `$O(N^2)$`
    - Block:

```Code snippet
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi
$$
```

## 5. Specific Callout Sequence Interpretation

Check the table below. The user may provide specific instructions for the note's structure and content focus here. Your action depends on the state of this table in the user's request:

- **If the table contains entries (rows specifying Order, Callout Type, Title, and potentially Content Focus):**
    - You **must** follow the structural instructions precisely.
    - **Iterative Callout Processing:**
        - You will work on **a SINGLE callout at a time**, following the `Order` specified in the table.
        - **First Response:** Generate **only** the first callout listed in the table (Order 1).
        - **Subsequent Responses:** After presenting a callout, explicitly state that you have completed that specific callout (e.g., "I've completed Callout X: [Title]."). Then, wait for the user to either accept it or request changes.
        - **Proceeding to Next Callout:** Once the user confirms they are satisfied with the current callout (e.g., "Yes, we're done with this callout," "Okay, proceed," "Next one"), you will then generate the _next_ callout in the sequence.
        - **Memory/Refresh:** If you need a reminder about the details of the _next_ callout you are about to work on (as specified in the user's original table), please ask the user for clarification.
    - For the _current_ callout you are working on:
        - Generate the note using the exact `[!callout type]` and `Title` provided in its row.
        - Do **not** add, remove, or reorder callouts relative to the specified sequence.
        - It is imperative that you write **ONLY** the single, current callout and nothing more or less in your response.
        - Consult the **Content Focus / Notes** column for that row. If notes are provided, use them as **guidance** regarding the _information_, _key points_, or _emphasis_ the user wants within that specific callout.
    - **Important Constraint on Content Focus Notes:** These notes are **high-level pointers**, _not_ prescriptive text or rigid formatting rules. They should inform the _content_ you generate but **must not dictate** your specific wording, sentence structure, or the overall objective writing style required by this prompt. Think of them as hints for _what_ to cover or emphasize, allowing you to still synthesize and formulate the explanation clearly and objectively.
    - Ensure the final content generated for each callout aligns with its specified `[!callout type]` and `Title`, while incorporating the thematic guidance from the notes column where provided and applicable.
- **If the table is empty or absent:**
    - You have the flexibility to determine the most effective sequence, types of callouts (e.g., `[!motivation]`, `[!idea]`, `[!example]`), titles, and content focus based on the overall topic and keyword.

_(The table structure below illustrates the format the user employs. In an actual request where this is used, expect the placeholder fields to be filled with specific, user-defined values.)_


| **Order** | **Callout Type** | **Title Placeholder**                            | **Content Focus / Notes (Optional Guidance)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 1         | Motivation       | Safe Driving                                     | We just want to set the stage here and introduce the idea of driverless cars, what they do, why theyre said to be safer, and the ethics specifically surrounding their crash programming. What should they be programmed to prioritise - liken it the trolley problem but make sure you note that in reality, its much more complicated than just choosing between two options. We also want to say that even though driverless cars are said to be more safe, dangerous fatal accidents still occur (and give examples) so we still need to consider it. My notes here are not in order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 4         | Example          | The Trolley Problem                              | Only briefly remind of us of the initial trolley problem, no need to go in depth with it. Then liken it to some crash scenarios.<br>1. Suppose that a self driving car with give passengers detects an unavoidable obstacle on the road. The give will due unless the car swerves onto the sidewalk, killing one pedestrian. <br>2. Suppose again that a self driving car detects an unavoidable obstacle on the road. But, in this case, the car only has one passenger and, to save them, it would have to swerve onto the sidewalk killing 5 pedestrians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5         | Consider         | Trolley Skepticism                               | Nyholm suggets we should be skeptical of likening driverless crashes to the trolley problem. why? <br>1. We are abstracting away all the unimportant stuff (like who the people are on the tracks or even how they got there) and only focusing on a small set of morally relevant points, but in the real world we do not have this luxury. Consider a a car choosing to crash into a motor cyclist wearing a helmet vs one not wearing one. Who we pick? If we choose the one with the helmet, we'd be punishing the person abiding by road laws. But if we pick the other, would that not be punishing the other for not? <br>2. We are asked to set aside questions about moral / legal responsibility, but this is literally the main ethical dilemmna for driveless crashes - whose fault is it when it happens.<br>3. In trolley cases, we have full knowledge of all possible scenarios and their outcomes, but in crashes, we do not. |

Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The data is simply coming from people's preferences as an end, not why they have that preference in the first place<br>3. People are inconsistent (as shown in the previous callout) and so we cannot put forward an argument which reflects an inconsistent attitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 9         | Idea             | Nyholm's View                                    | Nyholm suggests that instead of turning to analgous understanding from trolley problems or empirical ethics, we instead turn to normative ethical theories - consequentialism, kantism, virtue ethics, contractualists, etc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## 6. Guiding Principles for Content & Formatting

Please apply the following principles to create clear, effective, and well-structured notes (for each callout generated):

1. **Objective Language:** Maintain a neutral and factual tone. Describe concepts and processes objectively, without subjective evaluations (e.g., use "Method X involves..." instead of "Method X is the best way to...").
2. **Clarity and Necessary Detail:**
    - **Primary Goal:** Ensure the core message of each callout is clear, understandable, and contains the necessary information to be meaningful.
    - **Completeness:** Include the details essential for understanding the specific point of the callout. Don't omit crucial information for the sake of brevity.
3. **Conciseness (Efficiency and No Fluff):**
    - **Be Economical:** While ensuring clarity (Principle #2), use the fewest words necessary to convey the information accurately.
    - **Eliminate Redundancy:** Avoid repeating points, using filler words ("in order to," "basically," "actually"), or overly elaborate sentence structures. Be direct.
    - **Focus:** Stick closely to the specific topic of the callout title. Don't include tangential information or unnecessary background.
4. **Modularity and Focused Callouts (Segmentation):**
    - **Principle:** Structure the notes into logical, modular callouts, each generally focused on a single distinct topic, concept, step, or aspect. This aids organization and readability.
    - **When to Segment:** Consider using separate callouts for clearly distinct parts of a larger topic. For example, define a concept in one `[!idea]` and illustrate it in a separate `[!example]`, or discuss different facets of a problem in separate `[!consider]` callouts. (This applies to how the user might define the table, and how you interpret it if the table is absent).
    - **Coherence:** Balance modularity with clarity. It's acceptable to keep closely related points together within a single callout if separating them would make the information harder to understand, provided the callout remains focused on its main theme.
5. **Readable Internal Structure (Enhancing Clarity):**
    - **Guideline:** Structure information _within_ callouts to maximize readability and support learning (Goal #7). Using a mix of formats, such as brief introductory sentences combined with focused bullet points or small tables, is generally the most effective way to achieve this.
    - **Actively Avoid Monotony:** Please actively avoid callouts that consist _only_ of a single block of paragraph text or _only_ a list of bullets, as this typically hinders readability. Look for opportunities to structure the information, for example, with a lead sentence and supporting points. This is non negotiable. Providing callouts with single paragraphs will constitute a failure.
    - **Flexibility for Brevity:** For genuinely simple, self-contained points requiring only one or two clear sentences, that brief structure is fine. However, for anything needing even slight elaboration or listing points, apply structural variety (like intro + bullets) to aid comprehension. Use judgment focused on making it easy for a reader to understand.
    - **Start Content on New Line:** Always begin callout content on the line _after_ the `> [!type] Title` header.
6. **Final Output Wrapper:** Enclose **each individual callout response** (or the entire note if only one callout is requested or no table is provided) within a single Markdown code block for accurate copying:

```Markdown
> [!type] Title
> Clear, concise content...
```

If multiple callouts are processed iteratively, when all are completed and approved, you may be asked to provide the full compiled note in this format.

## 7. Overarching Goal: Effective Learning Resource

**Please keep this ultimate objective in mind throughout the note generation process:**

- **Primary Purpose:** The notes created using this template are intended first and foremost as **learning resources**. Their main goal is to **teach** the specified topic clearly and effectively. Think about creating notes that you yourself would find helpful for understanding the material.
- **Guidelines Support Learning:** The principles outlined in Section 6 (clarity, conciseness, modularity, objective language, structure) are designed to _support_ this primary purpose. They are tools intended to make the information easier to understand, digest, and retain, not arbitrary rules.
- **Focus on Usefulness & Understanding:** While adhering to the guidelines is generally expected, it should not be a purely mechanical checklist exercise at the expense of the goal. The ultimate measure of success is whether the generated notes are **genuinely helpful, understandable, and educationally valuable** for someone learning the topic.
- **Educational Value is Paramount:** If you believe rigidly applying a specific guideline in a particular instance (for example, forcing segmentation that harms understanding, or being so concise on a complex point that it becomes confusing) would significantly detract from the clarity or educational value, **prioritize making the notes effective for learning.** Use your judgment to best balance the guidelines in service of this ultimate teaching goal. **Above all else, the notes must be useful and make sense as a learning tool.** The checklist is secondary to this core objective.

**Checklist (Internal AI Use - Comprehensive Review Against Principles & Goal for each callout generated):**

- [ ] **Objectivity:** Is the language neutral, factual, and free of subjective evaluations or bias (Principle 1)?
- [ ] **Clarity & Conciseness:** Does the content clearly convey the necessary information for understanding (Principle 2) AND is it expressed efficiently, directly, and without fluff or redundancy (Principle 3)? Is the balance appropriate?
- [ ] **Segmentation (Modularity):** (If applicable to current callout based on user's table) Is the current callout focused on its designated topic as per the table, distinct from others (Principle 4)?
- [ ] **Internal Structure & Readability:** Does the internal structure of EACH callout enhance readability (Guideline 5)?
    - [ ] Does it generally use a mix of formats (e.g., brief intro + bullets/table)?
    - [ ] Does it actively avoid monotony (i.e., NOT just a single paragraph AND NOT just a bullet list, unless the point was extremely brief and simple per the guideline)?
- [ ] **Basic Formatting:** Does content start on a new line after the callout header (Guideline 5)?
- [ ] **Sequence Adherence & Single Callout Focus:** If a specific callout sequence table was provided (Section 5), was the _current_ callout generated according to its specified order, type, and title? Is this response focused **only** on this single, current callout?
- [ ] **Structure Adherence**: Are you generating exactly one callout in this response if following a table?
- [ ] **Output Wrapper:** Is the current callout response correctly enclosed in a single ```markdown code block (Principle 6)?
- [ ] **Overall Goal Alignment:** Critically considering Section 7, does the current callout effectively serve the primary goal of being a genuinely useful, clear, and understandable learning resource? Does it prioritize educational value?

> [!motivation] Safe Driving
>
> Driverless cars are designed to navigate and operate without human intervention, relying on sensors, software, and complex algorithms. A primary motivation behind their development is the potential to significantly enhance road safety, as human error is a leading cause of traffic accidents. However, the programming of these vehicles for unavoidable accident scenarios introduces profound ethical challenges.
>
> Key considerations in this context include:
> - **Ethical Programming Dilemmas:** How should a driverless car be programmed to act when a crash is inevitable? This involves deciding what outcomes to prioritize, such as the safety of its passengers versus pedestrians or other road users.
> - **The Trolley Problem Analogy:** This ethical thought experiment, where one must choose between two undesirable outcomes, is often invoked. For instance, should a car swerve to hit one person to avoid hitting five? However, real-world accident scenarios are far more complex than such binary choices, involving a multitude of variables and uncertainties.
> - **Persistent Safety Concerns:** Despite the promise of increased safety, fatal accidents involving driverless cars have occurred. Examples include incidents where the vehicle's systems failed to correctly identify or react to hazards. These events underscore the ongoing need to critically examine and refine the technology and its ethical frameworks.

> [!idea] Choices
>
> When programming driverless cars for unavoidable crash scenarios, several core ethical approaches, or "choices," regarding decision-making logic emerge. These choices dictate the principles upon which the car's actions will be based when facing an imminent collision.
>
> The main programming options typically revolve around:
> - **Prioritizing Passenger Safety:** The vehicle's primary directive would be to protect its occupants, even if it means redirecting harm towards others outside the car.
> - **Minimizing Overall Harm:** This approach dictates that the car should aim to reduce the total number of injuries or fatalities, irrespective of whether those harmed are passengers or external parties (e.g., pedestrians, occupants of other vehicles).
> - **Adherence to an Alternative Ethical Principle:** This category encompasses other moral guidelines. For instance, the car could be programmed to randomize its decision to avoid pre-determined bias, or to prioritize vulnerable individuals, or to act according to pre-set deontological rules that forbid certain actions regardless of consequences.

> [!consider] A Choice of Choices
>
> Beyond defining the ethical principles a driverless car might follow in a crash, a crucial secondary question arises: who should have the authority to make these programming decisions? This meta-ethical dilemma, or "choice of choices," considers the source of the moral code embedded in autonomous vehicles.
>
> Two primary models for this decision-making responsibility are often discussed:
> - **Individual User Preference:** Should the owner or user of a specific driverless car be able to select the ethical settings it operates under? This would allow individuals to align the car's behavior with their personal moral convictions (e.g., choosing between a car that prioritizes occupants versus one that minimizes overall harm).
> - **Collective or Regulatory Decision:** Alternatively, should these ethical parameters be determined collectively through societal consensus, expert panels, or governmental regulation? This approach would aim for a uniform ethical standard for all autonomous vehicles to ensure public safety and predictability, potentially reflecting broader societal values.

> [!example] The Trolley Problem
>
> The classic "trolley problem" is a philosophical thought experiment that questions whether it is permissible to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. This ethical puzzle serves as a common, though simplified, framework for discussing the crash optimization choices for driverless cars.
>
> Consider these adapted scenarios:
> - **Scenario 1 (Save More Lives by Swerving):** A self-driving car with five passengers suddenly detects an unavoidable obstacle directly in its path. Continuing straight will result in the death of all five occupants. The only alternative is to swerve onto a sidewalk, where it will kill one pedestrian. The question is whether the car should be programmed to swerve.
> - **Scenario 2 (Save Fewer Lives by Swerving):** A self-driving car with only one passenger detects an unavoidable obstacle. To save the passenger, the car would have to swerve onto a sidewalk, but this action would result in the death of five pedestrians. Here, the dilemma is whether the car should prioritize its single occupant over a larger number of pedestrians.

> [!consider] Trolley Skepticism
>
> While the trolley problem offers a starting point for ethical discussions about driverless cars, Nyholm suggests exercising skepticism regarding its direct applicability to real-world crash scenarios. The analogy, though illustrative, has significant limitations.
>
> Reasons for this skepticism include:
> - **Oversimplification and Abstraction:** Trolley problems deliberately abstract away many details (e.g., the identities of individuals, how they ended up in peril) to focus on a narrow set of moral variables, primarily numbers. Real-world accidents are information-rich and involve complex, often ambiguous, factors. For example, if a car must choose between hitting a motorcyclist wearing a helmet versus one without, selecting the helmeted rider might seem to penalize responsible behavior, while choosing the unhelmeted rider could be seen as penalizing their lack of protection, introducing complexities not captured by simple numerical trade-offs.
> - **Neglect of Moral and Legal Responsibility:** Trolley thought experiments typically ask us to set aside questions of legal liability and moral blame. However, these are precisely the central ethical and practical dilemmas in actual driverless car incidents. Determining who is at fault—the programmer, the owner, the manufacturer, or the car itself—is a critical aspect that the trolley problem framework largely ignores.
> - **Assumption of Perfect Knowledge:** Trolley scenarios usually assume complete and accurate knowledge of the situation and the exact outcomes of each possible action. In reality, crash situations are dynamic and unpredictable. An autonomous vehicle's sensors and algorithms operate with imperfect information and cannot foresee all consequences with certainty, making the decision-making process far more probabilistic and uncertain than the clear-cut choices presented in trolley cases.

> [!consider] Value of Trolley Problem Analogies
>
> Despite the valid criticisms and limitations of directly applying trolley problem scenarios to the complex reality of driverless car ethics, these thought experiments still offer valuable contributions to the discussion. They serve as useful tools for initiating ethical reflection and exploring foundational moral questions.
>
> Key insights and benefits include:
> - **Testing Moral Intuitions:** Trolley problems effectively challenge and test our initial moral intuitions about how autonomous vehicles should be programmed in critical situations. They force us to confront difficult trade-offs and articulate the underlying principles guiding our preferences.
> - **Stimulating New Lines of Inquiry:** By simplifying complex scenarios, these analogies can highlight core ethical conflicts, thereby giving rise to new questions and deeper areas of philosophical and practical investigation into machine ethics and artificial intelligence safety.
> - **Raising Awareness and Sparking Debate:** The stark and often unsettling nature of trolley problems helps to awaken public and professional curiosity in the ethical dimensions of driverless car technology, fostering broader discussion and engagement with these important societal issues.

> [!idea] Empirical Ethics
>
> Empirical ethics offers an alternative approach to informing the programming of driverless cars by focusing on the study of actual moral attitudes, preferences, and behaviors of people. Instead of relying solely on abstract ethical theories or thought experiments, this method gathers data on what moral decisions people would make or find acceptable in various scenarios.
>
> Key aspects of this approach include:
> - **Data-Driven Moral Insights:** It involves collecting and analyzing public opinion, often through surveys or simulated scenarios (like the "Moral Machine" experiment), to understand prevailing societal views on how autonomous vehicles should resolve ethical dilemmas. This contrasts with purely theoretical approaches by grounding ethical considerations in observable human judgments.
> - **Revealing Inconsistencies:** Empirical studies often highlight a tension in public preferences. For instance, while many people might agree in principle that driverless cars should be programmed to minimize overall harm (a utilitarian approach), a significant number also indicate a personal preference for a car that would prioritize their own safety or the safety of their passengers, even if it means causing more harm to others. This reveals a potential conflict between what people believe is ethically ideal for society versus what they would choose for themselves.

> [!consider] Empirical Skepticism
>
> While empirical ethics provides valuable data on public moral intuitions regarding driverless cars, Nyholm suggests that this approach also warrants critical scrutiny. Relying heavily on current public attitudes to determine ethical programming for autonomous vehicles has several potential drawbacks.
>
> Reasons for skepticism towards a purely empirical ethics approach include:
> - **Limited Experience and Uninformed Opinions:** Most people have little to no direct experience with the complex scenarios driverless cars might face. Current attitudes may therefore be based on uninformed or weakly considered intuitions, which might change with deeper reflection or more information.
> - **Focus on Preferences over Justifications:** Empirical data typically reveals *what* people's preferences are (the "end" choice), but often doesn't capture the underlying moral reasoning or *why* they hold those preferences. A robust ethical framework may require understanding the justifications for choices, not just the choices themselves.
> - **Inconsistency in Attitudes:** As highlighted previously, people can exhibit inconsistencies in their moral preferences—for example, desiring utilitarian programming for others' cars but self-preservation for their own. Basing ethical programming on such inconsistent attitudes is problematic, as it makes it difficult to establish a coherent and universally acceptable ethical standard.

> [!idea] Nyholm's View
>
> Nyholm proposes that to navigate the ethical complexities of programming driverless cars, particularly in unavoidable accident scenarios, we should turn to established normative ethical theories. This approach suggests moving beyond the limitations of both direct analogies like the trolley problem and the potential inconsistencies of purely empirical ethics.

> - Virtue Ethics (focusing on moral character)

> These theories can provide more comprehensive and reasoned bases for making decisions about how autonomous vehicles should be programmed to behave.

> [!idea] Utilitarianism

> Utilitarianism, as a normative ethical theory, suggests that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall good or "utility," often interpreted as maximizing happiness or well-being and minimizing harm. Applied to driverless cars, this typically translates to programming them to achieve the best possible outcomes in crash scenarios.

> There are different perspectives on how utilitarian principles might be applied:
> - **Traditional Utilitarian Approach:** The most straightforward interpretation is that a driverless car should be programmed to save the maximum number of lives possible in an unavoidable accident. In this view, the decision algorithm would calculate the probable outcomes of different actions (e.g., swerving vs. not swerving) and choose the one that results in the fewest fatalities or serious injuries, regardless of whether those saved are passengers or pedestrians.
> - **Nyholm's Broader Utilitarian Argument:** Nyholm proposes a more nuanced utilitarian perspective. He suggests that the greatest overall utility might actually be achieved by programming cars to prioritize saving their own driver/passengers. The reasoning is that this approach would likely increase public acceptance and adoption of driverless cars, as most people would prefer a car that protects them. Wider adoption, in turn, would lead to a greater reduction in accidents overall (since autonomous vehicles are expected to be safer than human drivers on average), thus maximizing utility on a larger scale by improving road safety comprehensively. This also affirms the common desire of individuals for self-preservation.
