> [!motivation] Moral Inequivalence
> 
> Rachels argues there is no moral difference between killing and letting die, but what if this assumption is incorrect? What if actively killing someone is morally worse than letting them die? This perspective challenges the foundation of arguments for active euthanasia.
> 
> If killing is indeed worse than letting die, then:
> 
> - The distinction between active and passive euthanasia becomes morally significant
> - Medical ethics codes prohibiting active euthanasia may be justified
> - Legal boundaries prohibiting active euthanasia serve an important protective function
> 
> This raises the question: **Is there a defensible moral basis for considering killing to be worse than letting die?**

> [!consider] Critique of Rachels' Equivalence Argument
> 
> A fundamental flaw in Rachels' Smith and Jones thought experiment is that it doesn't actually compare killing to letting die in the way he claims.
> 
> **The Two Killers Problem**:
> 
> - Nesbitt argues that Rachels effectively gives two examples of killing, not one of each
> - Both Smith and Jones fully intend to kill the child and would have actively done so if necessary
> - Jones merely "lets die" in the most superficial sense - he actively chooses not to save someone he wants dead
> 
> **Intention vs. Action**:
> 
> - Jones' non-intervention is morally equivalent to killing precisely because his intention was murderous
> - In a true "letting die" case, the person has no desire for the death to occur
> - Rachels confuses "allowing a death you want" with genuinely "letting die"
> 
> **The Proper Distinction**:
> 
> - Genuine "letting die" involves allowing nature to take its course without desiring the outcome
> - Jones' case is better described as "killing by omission" - using inaction as the method of murder
> - The experiment fails to demonstrate what Rachels claims because it doesn't actually compare killing to letting die
> 
> By constructing an example where both cases involve murderous intent, Rachels hasn't shown that killing and letting die are morally equivalent - only that two forms of intended killing can be equally wrong.

> [!idea] Nesbitt's Moral Inequivalence View
> 
> Philosopher Winston Nesbitt defends the traditional distinction between killing and letting die as morally significant.
> 
> **Nesbitt's Key Arguments**:
> 
> - **Causal Responsibility**: Killing initiates a fatal causal chain; letting die merely allows an existing process to continue
>     - Killer is the primary cause of death
>     - One who lets die is a secondary factor in a process already underway
> - **Rights and Duties**: Killing violates negative rights; letting die fails to fulfill positive duties
>     - We have strong negative duties not to harm others
>     - Positive duties to aid others, while important, are generally weaker
> - **Moral Psychology**: The prohibition against killing forms a fundamental boundary in human moral psychology
>     - The act/omission distinction helps maintain important moral constraints
>     - Eroding this boundary may weaken essential moral prohibitions
> - **Practical Consequences**: Maintaining the distinction protects vulnerable populations
>     - Medical ethics codes prohibiting killing create a bright-line rule against potential abuses
>     - Allowing exceptions risks undermining important protections
> 
> Nesbitt concludes that even when outcomes are identical, the difference between killing and letting die remains morally significant and should be preserved in medical ethics.


> [!consider] Kuhse's Response to the Moral Inequivalence View
> 
> Philosopher Helga Kuhse challenges Nesbitt's defense of the moral distinction between killing and letting die.
> 
> **Kuhse's Key Arguments**:
> 
> - **Responsibility for Outcomes**: When a doctor deliberately withholds treatment knowing death will result, they take responsibility for that death
>     - The doctor makes a decision that directly leads to death
>     - The doctor could have prevented death but chose not to
> - **Arbitrary Distinctions**: The killing/letting die distinction often depends on arbitrary factors
>     - Whether turning off a ventilator is "killing" or "letting die" is unclear
>     - The same outcome with different physical movements may be classified differently
> - **Intention Matters More**: The doctor's intention and the patient's interests should be the central moral focus
>     - If death is in the patient's best interest, the method becomes secondary
>     - Both active and passive methods can be motivated by compassion
> - **Patient-Centered Ethics**: Medical ethics should prioritize patient welfare over abstract distinctions
>     - Suffering can sometimes be worse than death
>     - Prolonging dying through passive means may increase suffering
> 
> Kuhse argues that maintaining the active/passive distinction may actually lead to worse outcomes for patients, as it can result in prolonged, painful deaths that active measures would prevent.
