> [!motivation] Moral Inequivalence
> 
> Rachels argues there is no moral difference between killing and letting die, but what if this assumption is incorrect? What if actively killing someone is morally worse than letting them die? This perspective challenges the foundation of arguments for active euthanasia.
> 
> If killing is indeed worse than letting die, then:
> 
> - The distinction between active and passive euthanasia becomes morally significant
> - Medical ethics codes prohibiting active euthanasia may be justified
> - Legal boundaries prohibiting active euthanasia serve an important protective function
> 
> This raises the question: **Is there a defensible moral basis for considering killing to be worse than letting die?**

> [!consider] Critique of Rachels' Equivalence Argument
> 
> A fundamental flaw in Rachels' Smith and Jones thought experiment is that it doesn't actually compare killing to letting die in the way he claims.
> 
> **The Two Killers Problem**:
> 
> - Nesbitt argues that Rachels effectively gives two examples of killing, not one of each
> - Both Smith and Jones fully intend to kill the child and would have actively done so if necessary
> - Jones merely "lets die" in the most superficial sense - he actively chooses not to save someone he wants dead
> 
> **Intention vs. Action**:
> 
> - Jones' non-intervention is morally equivalent to killing precisely because his intention was murderous
> - In a true "letting die" case, the person has no desire for the death to occur
> - Rachels confuses "allowing a death you want" with genuinely "letting die"
> 
> **The Proper Distinction**:
> 
> - Genuine "letting die" involves allowing nature to take its course without desiring the outcome
> - Jones' case is better described as "killing by omission" - using inaction as the method of murder
> - The experiment fails to demonstrate what Rachels claims because it doesn't actually compare killing to letting die
> 
> By constructing an example where both cases involve murderous intent, Rachels hasn't shown that killing and letting die are morally equivalent - only that two forms of intended killing can be equally wrong.
