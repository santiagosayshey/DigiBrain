The **Difference Thesis** is the claim that there is an intrinsic moral difference between killing (active euthanasia) and letting die (passive euthanasia), regardless of outcomes, intentions, or circumstances.

- **Rachels:** There is no moral difference between active and passive euthanasia (killing vs. letting die). The distinction is morally irrelevant.
- **Nesbitt:** There is a fundamental moral difference between killing and letting die. Killing is inherently worse than letting die regardless of circumstances.
- **Kuhse:** There is a difference between killing and letting die in some contexts, but Nesbitt argued for it incorrectly and for the wrong reasons. The difference doesn't support the broad conclusion that killing is always worse than letting die - in some cases (like euthanasia), active killing can be more humane.
- **Beauchamp:** The killing/letting die distinction is sometimes morally relevant but not always. Both Rachels and Nesbitt are partially right but overgeneralize. We need a context-sensitive approach that considers multiple factors (intention, justification, consent, etc.) beyond just the active/passive distinction. The moral assessment should be nuanced rather than categorical, allowing that both active and passive actions can be either justified or unjustified depending on circumstances.
