The **Difference Thesis** is the claim that there is an intrinsic moral difference between killing (active euthanasia) and letting die (passive euthanasia), regardless of outcomes, intentions, or circumstances.

|Philosopher/Organization|Core Position|
|---|---|
|**American Medical Association (AMA)**|Endorses the Difference Thesis in medical practice. Maintains a strict distinction between active and passive euthanasia. Considers active euthanasia (intentionally terminating life) unethical and contrary to medical profession standards. Accepts passive euthanasia (ceasing extraordinary measures) only under specific conditions: (1) extraordinary means are being used, (2) irrefutable evidence of imminent death exists, and (3) patient/family consent is available.|
|**James Rachels**|Directly challenges the Difference Thesis. Argues the active/passive distinction has no moral importance. Uses the Smith/Jones drowning cases to show that both killing and letting die can be equally wrong. Claims the moral assessment should focus on the outcomes and intentions, not whether the action was active or passive. Believes we ought to abandon the active/passive distinction for moral reasoning.|
|**Winston Nesbitt**|Defends the Difference Thesis against Rachels' critique. Argues there is an intrinsic moral difference between killing and letting die. Rejects Rachels' examples as misleading because they equalize all other morally relevant factors. Maintains that the act of killing itself carries unique moral significance that letting die does not, regardless of consequences. Believes the difference is not merely psychological but genuinely moral.|
|**Helga Kuhse**|Directly challenges Nesbitt's defense of the Difference Thesis through rigorous logical analysis. Reconstructs Nesbitt's argument as: (1) People willing to kill for personal gain pose greater social threat than those only willing to let die; (2) Morality's purpose is enabling peaceful coexistence; (3) Actions posing greater threats to social peace are morally worse; therefore (4) Killing is morally worse than letting die. Identifies this as a fallacy of overgeneralization: Nesbitt's premises only support the narrower conclusion that "killing for personal gain is worse than letting die for personal gain," not the universal claim about all killing versus letting die. Points out additional logical problems: Nesbitt conflates agent evaluation with action evaluation; examines only cases with harmful intent, ignoring benevolent motives; and fails to consider comparative cases like mercy killing versus allowing prolonged suffering. Uses this analysis to demonstrate that active euthanasia can sometimes be morally preferable to passive euthanasia, particularly when passive approaches would cause more suffering. Supports Rachels' view that other factors (intention, consent, suffering) are what truly matter morally, not the killing/letting die distinction itself.|
|**Tom Beauchamp**|Takes a nuanced position on the Difference Thesis. Argues it's sometimes valid but not universally applicable. Critiques Rachels for overgeneralizing from specific cases while acknowledging the force of his examples. Critiques the traditional medical ethics position for oversimplifying complex moral issues. Believes the moral assessment should consider multiple factors including justification, context, intention, and consentâ€”treating the active/passive distinction as one relevant factor among many. Suggests both active and passive actions can be either justified or unjustified depending on circumstances.|
