The **Difference Thesis** is the claim that there is an intrinsic moral difference between killing (active euthanasia) and letting die (passive euthanasia), regardless of outcomes, intentions, or circumstances.

| **American Medical Association (AMA)** | Endorses the Difference Thesis in medical practice. Maintains a strict distinction between active and passive euthanasia. Accepts passive euthanasia only under specific conditions: (1) extraordinary means are being used, (2) irrefutable evidence of imminent death exists, and (3) patient/family consent is available.                                    | Active euthanasia should be prohibited as contrary to medical profession standards. Passive euthanasia (ceasing extraordinary measures) may be permitted under specific, limited circumstances with appropriate safeguards and conditions.                                                                                                     |
| **James Rachels**                      | Rejects the Difference Thesis. Argues there is no intrinsic moral difference between killing and letting die. Uses the Smith/Jones drowning cases to show both acts can be equally wrong when all other factors are held constant. Focuses on outcomes and intentions rather than the nature of the act itself.                                                 | Active euthanasia should be permitted in the same circumstances where passive euthanasia is permitted. Since there's no moral difference between killing and letting die, it's inconsistent to allow passive euthanasia while forbidding active euthanasia.                                                                                    |
| **Winston Nesbitt**                    | Defends the Difference Thesis. Argues killing is inherently morally worse than letting die because people willing to kill pose a greater threat to social peace. Believes the act itself carries moral significance regardless of outcomes or intentions. Grounds morality in social utility and threat assessment.                                             | Active euthanasia should remain prohibited, even while permitting passive euthanasia in some circumstances. The inherent moral difference between killing and letting die justifies treating them differently in medical practice and policy.                                                                                                  |
| **Helga Kuhse**                        | Critiques the Difference Thesis by exposing logical fallacies in Nesbitt's defense. Identifies his overgeneralization from specific cases to universal principles. Uses his own reasoning structure to show active euthanasia can sometimes be preferable. Focuses on patient welfare rather than abstract distinctions.                                        | Active euthanasia can sometimes be morally preferable to passive euthanasia, particularly when passive approaches would cause extended suffering. The prohibition on active euthanasia is not justified by the arguments typically used to defend it.                                                                                          |
| **Tom Beauchamp**                      | Takes a nuanced position on the Difference Thesis. Argues the killing/letting die distinction is sometimes morally relevant but not universally so. Introduces medical fallibility and uncertainty as creating morally relevant differences in some contexts. Believes moral assessment should consider multiple factors beyond the active/passive distinction. | Whether active euthanasia is permissible depends on context. There can be morally relevant differences between active and passive approaches (particularly related to medical fallibility), but this doesn't support a universal prohibition. Each case should be evaluated on multiple factors including intention, consent, and uncertainty. |
