> [!motivation] A Terrible World
>
> Sexual assault represents one of the most pervasive forms of harm in contemporary society, affecting individuals across all demographic groups. Understanding its prevalence provides essential context for examining the ethical frameworks surrounding sexual conduct and consent.
>
> **Scope of the Problem:**
> - Research indicates that approximately 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men experience rape at some point in their lives
> - Nearly 1 in 2 women and 1 in 5 men experience some form of sexual violence during their lifetime
> - These statistics likely underrepresent actual occurrences due to significant underreporting
>
> **University Context:**
> College campuses present particular challenges:
> - Studies suggest 13% of all college students experience rape or sexual assault
> - First-year students face heightened vulnerability, particularly during the initial months
> - Alcohol involvement occurs in approximately half of sexual assault cases on campuses
>
> **Disproportionate Impact on Marginalized Communities:**
> - Transgender individuals face assault rates exceeding 47% according to the U.S. Transgender Survey
> - Bisexual women experience significantly higher rates of sexual violence compared to heterosexual women
> - LGBTQ+ students report sexual harassment at nearly double the rate of their heterosexual peers
> - These communities often face additional barriers to reporting and accessing support services
>
> The widespread nature of sexual violence and its devastating impact on survivors creates an urgent need for rigorous ethical analysis of sexual conduct, consent, and the moral obligations we hold toward one another in intimate contexts.

> [!idea] The Lenient Thesis
>
> The Lenient Thesis holds that **deceiving someone into sex by misleading them about certain personal features constitutes only a minor moral wrong** - a view that creates a hierarchy of deceptions with varying moral weights.
>
> **The Basic Distinction:**
> - Serious wrongs: Lying about STI status, contraception, identity, or consent itself
> - Minor wrongs: Misrepresenting age, wealth, feelings, accomplishments, or relationship intentions
> - Gray areas: Concealing past relationships, using old photos, exaggerating personal qualities
>
> This common intuition rests on several assumptions. First, it treats some deceptions as "white lies" that are normal in dating contexts - everyone embellishes a little when trying to attract someone. Second, it suggests the deceived party bears some responsibility for verifying important claims rather than taking everything at face value.
>
> **Why People Find This View Plausible:**
> The thesis aligns with how many people actually behave in romantic contexts, where presenting an idealized version of oneself is often expected. It also preserves a distinction between deception and assault - maintaining that while lying is wrong, it's not as serious as physical coercion or threats.
>
> This is precisely the view Dougherty will challenge, arguing **instead that all deception undermining sexual consent constitutes a serious moral wrong** regardless of what information is misrepresented.

> [!idea] Dougherty's Master Argument
>
> Dougherty directly opposes the Lenient Thesis, arguing that **all deception leading to sex is seriously morally wrong**. His position rests on understanding how deception violates consent through the concept of "dealbreakers."
>
> **The Dealbreaker Concept:**
> A dealbreaker is **any feature of a sexual encounter to which a person's will is opposed** - something that, if known, would lead them to refuse consent. When someone is deceived about a potential dealbreaker, they cannot give morally valid consent because their agreement is based on false information.
>
> Consider this example: Alex tells Jordan he's single when he's actually married. Jordan has made clear in past conversations that they would never sleep with someone who's married. Alex's marital status is a dealbreaker for Jordan. By concealing this information, Alex ensures Jordan's agreement is based on a false understanding of the situation - Jordan consents to sex with a single person, not a married one.
>
> **The Formal Argument:**
> Dougherty's position can be formalized as follows:
>
> - **P1:** Having sex with someone while lacking their morally valid consent is seriously wrong
> - **P2:** Deceiving another person into sex involves having sex with that person while lacking her morally valid consent
> - **C:** Therefore, deceiving someone into sex is seriously morally wrong
>
> This argument's power lies in connecting deception to the fundamental wrong of non-consensual sex. By showing that deception undermines morally valid consent (P2), Dougherty places all sexual deception in the same moral category as other serious violations of sexual autonomy.

> [!idea] Morally Valid Consent
>
> The key to Dougherty's argument lies in recognizing that **agreement is not sufficient for morally valid consent**. Someone can agree to sex while their consent remains morally invalid if that agreement is based on deception.
>
> **What Morally Valid Consent Requires:**
> Beyond mere agreement or saying "yes," morally valid consent requires:
> - Knowledge of relevant facts about the encounter
> - Freedom from coercion or undue pressure
> - Mental capacity to make informed decisions
> - Agreement based on accurate understanding of what one is consenting to
>
> This distinction explains why various forms of agreement don't constitute real consent. **A person who agrees to sex based on lies lacks knowledge of relevant facts**. Someone who says yes under threat lacks freedom. An intoxicated person may lack capacity. In each case, agreement exists without morally valid consent.

> [!consider] Rights Based Argument
>
> Rape is wrong because it violates an individual's autonomy right to control their own body and sexual self-determination. We have similar rights over our persons and property - we don't allow people to enter our homes without permission.
>
> **How Consent Works:**
> - By providing consent, we waive some rights (like allowing a hairdresser to touch our hair but not other body parts)
> - These waivers are revocable - we can withdraw permission at any time
> - Sexual rights are especially stringent because sexual contact is morally significant behavior
>
> Having control over who touches us sexually is centrally important, making these rights particularly strong. Breaking them is seriously morally wrong, not a minor infraction.
>
> **This Supports P1:** Having sex without morally valid consent violates sexual autonomy rights. Due to the stringency of these rights, doing so is seriously morally wrong.

> [!example] Chihuahuas
>
> To defend P2, we must show that deceived parties don't offer morally valid consent. Consider this case:
>
> Amy asks to let her dog into my apartment. Knowing I hate Chihuahuas, she falsely claims it's a Great Dane, and I hand over my keys. I come home to find a Chihuahua instead. Amy argues I consented since I agreed to let "her dog" in.
>
> **Why This Violates Consent:**
> - Clear dealbreaker: I wouldn't have agreed if I knew the truth
> - Amy didn't need explicit warning ("I hate Chihuahuas") to know she violated my consent
> - My agreement was to a Great Dane, not any dog
> - Concealing or lying about dealbreaker-relevant information undermines consent
>
> This illustrates Dougherty's key point: being explicit about dealbreakers isn't required for consent to be violated. Just as Amy violated my consent by lying about the dog, someone who lies about dealbreaker features before sex violates their partner's sexual consent - even if that partner never explicitly stated their dealbreakers.

> [!consider] Deceptive Consent
>
> Building on the Chihuahua example, deception violates valid consent in three key ways:
>
> **1. Explicitly Voiced Dealbreakers Are Ignored**
> Sarah tells Mark she absolutely won't sleep with anyone who's currently in a relationship. Mark lies and says he's single when he's actually married. Sarah's explicit boundary was violated through deception.
>
> **2. Implicitly Known Dealbreakers Are Ignored**  
> Tom knows his girlfriend Emma is deeply religious and would never have sex before marriage, though she's never explicitly said this to him. He tells her they're "spiritually married in God's eyes" to manipulate her into sex, knowing this violates her implicit values.
>
> **3. Information About Potential Dealbreakers Is Concealed**
> Alex suspects Jordan might not want to sleep with someone who has children (based on past comments about not wanting kids in their life), but isn't certain. Instead of mentioning his three kids and letting Jordan decide, Alex deliberately avoids the topic and hides all evidence of his children during their dates.
>
> In each case, the deceiver prevents their partner from making an informed decision by manipulating information about potential dealbreakers, thereby undermining morally valid consent.

> [!consider] Blameless Violation
>
> Sometimes a person will be blameless for violating another's consent when they couldn't reasonably know about a dealbreaker.
>
> **Example:**
> Candace asks to store her antique skis in Courtney's basement. Unbeknownst to either of them, the skis were once owned by Stalin. If Courtney knew this fact, it would be a dealbreaker - she would never allow Stalin's possessions in her home.
>
> According to Dougherty:
> - Candace did violate Courtney's consent (the skis had a dealbreaker property)
> - But Candace is blameless because she was justifiably ignorant of the skis' origins
> - The violation occurred without moral culpability
>
> This distinction matters for sexual cases too. If someone unknowingly possesses a dealbreaker quality their partner hasn't disclosed and couldn't reasonably be expected to know about, they may violate consent without being morally culpable for that violation.

> [!idea] Amending the Master Argument
>
> The blameless violation cases require Dougherty to refine his argument by adding the concept of culpability:
>
> **Amended Argument:**
> - **P1:** Having sex with someone while CULPABLY lacking their morally valid consent is seriously wrong
> - **P2:** Deceiving another person into sex involves having sex with that person while CULPABLY lacking her morally valid consent
> - **C:** Therefore, deceiving someone into sex is seriously morally wrong
>
> **What "Culpably" Means:**
> You culpably lack someone's consent when:
> - You know about their dealbreakers and violate them
> - You suspect potential dealbreakers and deliberately avoid finding out
> - You should reasonably know about likely dealbreakers given the context
> - You actively deceive them about information relevant to consent
>
> The addition of "culpably" excludes cases like the Stalin skis where someone unknowingly violates consent despite reasonable care. In sexual contexts, deception always involves culpability because the deceiver knowingly provides false information or conceals truth.

> [!consider] Implications of Dougherty's Framework
>
> Dougherty's view leads to several important conclusions about deception and sexual ethics:
>
> **1. Deception Isn't Wrong Per Se**
> Lying becomes seriously wrong specifically when it undermines sexual consent. Deception remains acceptable or expected in other contexts:
> - White lies to spare feelings ("Your haircut looks nice")
> - Privacy protection (giving fake names to telemarketers)
> - Fiction and entertainment (magic shows, novels)
> - Competitive contexts where deception is part of the game (poker, sports feints)
>
> **2. Culpability Is Morally Central**
> The amended argument shows that moral wrongness depends not just on outcomes but on whether someone culpably violated consent. This preserves important distinctions between intentional deception and unknowing violations.
>
> **3. Parallel Moral Status**
> Under this framework, deceiving someone into sex shares the same moral foundation as having sex with an unconscious person - both involve culpably lacking morally valid consent. While the methods differ (deception vs. incapacitation), the fundamental wrong is identical: violating someone's sexual autonomy rights by proceeding without their morally valid consent.
>
> This framework radically expands what counts as seriously wrong in sexual contexts while maintaining that deception itself isn't inherently immoral.
