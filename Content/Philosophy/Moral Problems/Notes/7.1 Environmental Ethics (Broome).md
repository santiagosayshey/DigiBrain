> [!motivation] A Threat to Humanity
>
> Climate change constitutes a recognized global threat, demanding ethical consideration. Key scientific observations include:
> - **Temperature Rise:** Global average surface temperature has increased by approximately $1^\circ C$ over the past century.
> - **Observed Effects:** Consequences include rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.
> - **Primary Cause:** This warming is primarily attributed to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with the burning of fossil fuels being a major contributor.

> [!consider] 2015 Paris Climate Agreement
>
> This legally binding international treaty established a global framework for climate action.
> - **Central Aim:** To limit global warming to well below $2$, preferably to $1.5$ degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
> - **Participation:** Adopted by 196 Parties (nearly every nation) at COP 21.
> - **Ethical Context:** It underscores the question of obligations—for nations and potentially individuals—to mitigate climate change's negative effects.
