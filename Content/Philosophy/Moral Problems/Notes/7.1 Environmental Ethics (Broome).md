> [!motivation] Climate Change: A Real and Credible Threat
> Climate change presents a significant challenge.
> - Global surface temperature has risen by approximately $1^{\circ}C$ over the last century.
> - As a result, we observe impacts like rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems.
> - This warming is primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions, with a major focus on the burning of fossil fuels in areas like energy production and transportation.

> [!consider] The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement
> The Paris Agreement is a major international treaty on climate change adopted in 2015 by nearly all countries.
> - **What it says**: Its main goal is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to $1.5$ degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
> - **How it sets the stage**: By establishing this global goal and requiring countries to outline their efforts (NDCs), the agreement reinforces the view that climate change requires action, framing current discussions about whether governments and individuals have obligations to address its negative effects.
