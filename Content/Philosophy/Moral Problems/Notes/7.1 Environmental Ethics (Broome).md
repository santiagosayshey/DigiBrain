> [!motivation] A Threat to Humanity
>
> Global climate change presents a scientifically established and significant threat to human well-being and ecological stability. Key indicators underscore the scale of this challenge:
> - The global average surface temperature has increased by approximately $1$°C ($1.8$°F) over the past century, with most warming occurring since the mid-20th century.
>
> This warming trend precipitates numerous observable consequences, including:
> - Rising sea levels due to thermal expansion of water and melting ice sheets/glaciers.
> - Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and powerful storms.
> - Significant disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, impacting agriculture and natural resources.
>
> The primary driver of current climate change is the increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities. The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy, industry, and transportation is the dominant source of these emissions, particularly carbon dioxide ($CO_2$). Deforestation and certain agricultural practices also contribute significantly. Understanding this causal link is fundamental to addressing the ethical dimensions of climate change.

> [!consider] 2015 Paris Climate Agreement
>
> The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), represents a major international effort to address climate change. Nearly every nation globally (196 Parties) agreed to its terms.
>
> Key objectives outlined in the Agreement include:
> - Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below $2$°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to $1.5$°C.
> - Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development.
> - Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.
>
> A central mechanism is the use of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), where each country outlines and communicates its post-2020 climate actions. The Agreement operates on a 5-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action.
>
> From an environmental ethics perspective, the Paris Agreement is significant because it formalizes a global consensus on the need for action. It implicitly acknowledges a shared, albeit differentiated, responsibility among nations. This framework heavily influences ongoing debates about the extent of moral obligations—both for governments (in setting policy and meeting NDC targets) and potentially for individuals (in terms of consumption, advocacy, and lifestyle choices)—to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and contribute to global solutions.
