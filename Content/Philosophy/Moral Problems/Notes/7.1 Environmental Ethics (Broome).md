> [!motivation] A Threat to Humanity
>
> Climate change presents a significant and credible threat to humanity. Key indicators highlight its severity:
> - Global average surface temperature has risen by approximately $1^{\circ}C$ over the last century.
> - Consequences include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems.
> The primary cause is the emission of greenhouse gases, largely from burning fossil fuels in sectors like energy and transport.

> [!consider] 2015 Paris Climate Agreement
>
> This is a legally binding international treaty on climate change, adopted by nearly every country.
> - Its central aim is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to $1.5^{\circ}C$, compared to pre-industrial levels.
> The agreement implicitly raises questions about the moral obligations of both governments and individuals to mitigate climate change impacts.

> [!consider] Broome's Glossary
>
> John Broome, an economist and philosopher, analyzes climate change ethics using distinct moral categories.
> - **Public Morality:** Refers to the moral duties applicable to governments and other public bodies.
> - **Private Morality:** Refers to the moral duties applicable to individuals in their private capacity.

> [!idea] Broome's View
>
> Broome argues climate change imposes moral duties in both the public and private spheres, distinguishing between two types:
>
> | Duty Type          | Description                               | Primary Bearer (Broome) |
> | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
> | Duties of Goodness | Obligation to make the world better       | Governments             |
> | Duties of Justice  | Obligation not to harm others unjustly    | Individuals             |
>
> He challenges the common assumption that only governments bear responsibility, asserting individuals primarily hold duties of justice regarding their emissions.

> [!idea] Private Morality
>
> Broome posits that individuals have a moral duty of justice not to cause greenhouse gas emissions without compensating for the resulting harm. Harming others through emissions constitutes an injustice.
>
> Evidence supporting this individual duty includes:
> 1. Harm results from our actions (emissions).
> 2. The harm is serious (climate impacts).
> 3. Emissions are generally not accidental.
> 4. Compensation is typically not made by emitters to victims.
> 5. Many emissions serve non-essential purposes ("selfish").
> 6. Harm disproportionately affects the poor, often without reciprocation.
> 7. Reducing personal emissions is feasible for many.

> [!consider] Broome's Demands
>
> Broome intends his conclusions on private morality not to be excessively demanding. He explores ways to fulfill the duty of justice:
> - Direct compensation to harmed individuals is impractical due to scale and identification issues.
> - International aid donations face similar challenges in targeting specific compensation.
> The most practical approach, he suggests, is to first reduce personal emissions significantly, then offset the remainder.

> [!idea] Offsetting
>
> Fulfilling the individual duty of justice involves two main actions:
> - **Reduction:** Live less wastefully (e.g., conserve resources, reduce meat consumption, choose local products).
> - **Offsetting:** Ensure that for every unit of greenhouse gas emitted, one unit is removed from the atmosphere.
> Calculating precise offsets is difficult; methods include overestimating needs, planting trees, or funding certified offset projects via reputable organizations.
> *(Note: Critics argue Broome's reliance on individual offsetting as justice is problematic, given the difficulty in calculation and execution, potentially favouring governmental regulation like carbon pricing for effectiveness and fairness).*
