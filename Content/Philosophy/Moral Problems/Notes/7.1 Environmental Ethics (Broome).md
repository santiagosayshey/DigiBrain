> [!motivation] A Threat to Humanity
>
> Climate change represents a significant and credible threat to global well-being. Scientific consensus indicates that the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by approximately $1^\circ C$ over the last century. This warming trend, primarily driven by human activities, is causing substantial environmental disruption.
> - **Consequences:** Observable effects include rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (heatwaves, droughts, floods), ocean acidification, and widespread impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity.
> - **Causes:** The primary driver is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) resulting from human activities. Key sources include the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial processes, deforestation, and certain agricultural practices. Establishing this reality is crucial for understanding the ethical dimensions that follow.

> [!consider] 2015 Paris Climate Agreement
>
> The Paris Agreement is a landmark international treaty adopted in 2015 by nearly every country. Its central aim is to limit global warming to well below $2^\circ C$, preferably to $1.5^\circ C$, compared to pre-industrial levels.
> - **Mechanism:** It operates through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), where each country sets its own targets for emission reductions and reports on progress.
> - **Ethical Context:** The agreement implicitly acknowledges a collective responsibility to address climate change. However, it primarily focuses on governmental actions. This sets the stage for debates, such as those explored by Broome, regarding the specific moral obligations of governments versus those of individuals in mitigating climate change harms.

> [!consider] Broome's Glossary
>
> John Broome, an economist and philosopher, analyzes the ethics of climate change by distinguishing between two spheres of morality:
> - **Public Morality:** This concerns the moral duties and responsibilities of governments and other public institutions. In the context of climate change, this involves decisions about national policies, regulations, and international cooperation.
> - **Private Morality:** This concerns the moral duties and responsibilities of private individuals in their personal capacity. This relates to individual actions, consumption patterns, and personal contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.

> [!idea] Broome's View
>
> Broome argues that climate change imposes distinct moral obligations within both public and private morality. He differentiates between:
> - **Duties of Goodness:** Obligations to promote well-being and make the world better. Broome generally assigns these duties primarily to governments in the climate context, involving actions like efficient resource management and cost-benefit analysis for the public good.
> - **Duties of Justice:** Obligations related to fairness, rights, and not harming others. Crucially, Broome challenges the common assumption that only governments bear responsibility for climate action. He contends that *individuals* have a stringent duty of justice concerning their personal emissions, specifically the duty not to cause harm without compensation. Governments, in his view, do not bear this same kind of duty of justice directly, though their policies (driven by goodness) impact justice outcomes.

> [!idea] Private Morality
>
> Broome posits that individual greenhouse gas emissions constitute an injustice – a violation of the duty not to harm others. He argues that individuals must not emit greenhouse gases unless they compensate for the harm caused by their emissions. This duty stems from the moral principle that one should not harm others. He provides seven characteristics of emission-causing activities to support this claim:
> 1.  **Causality:** The harm resulting from climate change (e.g., impacts of storms, sea-level rise) is a direct result of actions we take (emitting GHGs).
> 2.  **Severity:** The harm caused by climate change is serious, potentially leading to death, displacement, and loss of livelihood for many.
> 3.  **Intentionality:** The harm is not accidental; emitting GHGs is a known consequence of many common activities (driving, flying, consuming energy).
> 4.  **Lack of Compensation:** Generally, individuals do not compensate the specific people harmed by their personal emissions.
> 5.  **Selfishness:** Many emissions result from activities undertaken for personal benefit or convenience, where the harm falls disproportionately on others.
> 6.  **Non-Reciprocity:** The harm is often inflicted by wealthier individuals/nations upon poorer ones, who contribute less to the problem and are more vulnerable to its effects.
> 7.  **Feasibility of Reduction:** Individuals possess the means to reduce their emissions significantly without undue sacrifice.

> [!consider] Broome's Demands
>
> Broome argues that the duty of justice requires individuals to ensure their actions do not result in net harm through emissions. He explores ways to fulfill this duty:
> - **Direct Compensation:** Paying specific individuals harmed by one's emissions. Broome acknowledges this is impractical due to the dispersed, numerous, and often unidentifiable nature of victims.
> - **International Aid:** Donating to aid organizations. While potentially helpful, this doesn't directly fulfill the duty of justice owed to specific individuals harmed by one's *own* emissions.
> - **Reduction and Offsetting:** Broome concludes the most feasible approach is twofold:
>     - First, reduce personal emissions as much as practically possible.
>     - Second, offset the remaining unavoidable emissions to achieve a net-zero personal impact.
> Broome intends this not as an extreme demand but as a requirement of basic justice (not harming others).

> [!idea] Offsetting
>
> Fulfilling the individual duty of justice, according to Broome, primarily involves minimizing and neutralizing one's personal carbon footprint.
> - **Reduction:** This entails actively modifying behaviour to decrease emissions. Examples include:
>     - Reducing energy consumption (e.g., improving home insulation, using less heating/cooling).
>     - Minimizing waste (e.g., reducing consumption, recycling).
>     - Adopting lower-carbon transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, public transport, less flying).
>     - Changing dietary habits (e.g., reducing meat consumption).
>     - Consuming locally sourced goods.
> - **Offsetting:** For emissions that cannot be eliminated, individuals must ensure an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas is removed from the atmosphere.
>     - This means achieving 'carbon neutrality' for one's lifestyle.
>     - Methods include funding reputable carbon offsetting projects (e.g., reforestation, renewable energy development, methane capture).
>     - Calculating the exact offset needed is complex, often requiring estimation (Broome suggests overestimation to be safe).
>
> **Author's Note:** Broome's focus on individual justice through offsetting faces criticism. Assigning this complex calculation and moral weight primarily to individuals, while admitting its practical difficulties, seems potentially naive. Critics argue that systemic change driven by governments, capable of large-scale measurement and enforcement (e.g., via carbon taxes or cap-and-trade), is essential for effective and equitable climate action, rather than relying solely on individual, often hard-to-verify, acts of justice.

> [!idea] Public Morality
>
> Broome assigns governments duties of *goodness* regarding climate change. This means governments are morally obligated to act in ways that promote the overall well-being of their citizens and, to some extent, the global population. Their actions should be guided by principles aimed at achieving the best possible outcomes given the challenge of climate change.

> [!idea] Efficiency and Externalities
>
> A key aspect of the government's duty of goodness is promoting efficiency. Climate change involves significant *externalities*:
> - Individuals or companies emitting greenhouse gases typically do not bear the full cost of the climate harms their emissions cause. These costs (e.g., damages from extreme weather, adaptation costs) are imposed on others, often globally and in the future.
> - This mismatch between private costs and social costs represents a market failure, leading to inefficiently high levels of emissions.
> - Governments, through their duty of goodness, should implement policies to correct this inefficiency. Examples include carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, which aim to "internalize the externality" by making emitters pay for the societal cost of their emissions. The goal is to achieve *Pareto improvements* – policy changes that benefit some without harming others, or ideally, benefit society overall.

> [!idea] Optimisation
>
> Stemming from the duty of goodness, governments should ideally aim for *optimisation*. This involves managing resources – including the planet's capacity to absorb emissions – in a way that produces the greatest overall good for people, considering both present and future generations. This often involves complex cost-benefit analyses of climate policies, weighing the costs of mitigation and adaptation against the avoided damages from climate change. However, pure optimisation based solely on aggregate well-being might raise justice concerns if it imposes disproportionate burdens on vulnerable groups, even if it maximizes total good.

> [!idea] Compensation (Government Role)
>
> While Broome assigns the primary duty of justice (not harming or compensating) to individuals, governments acting out of goodness play a role related to compensation and fairness.
> - Government policies aimed at efficiency (like carbon pricing) can generate revenue. This revenue *can* be used in ways that address fairness concerns, potentially compensating those negatively impacted by climate change or by the policies themselves (e.g., rebates to low-income households).
> - However, Broome distinguishes this from the individual's direct moral duty of justice. For governments, compensation is part of the broader calculus of achieving good and efficient outcomes, rather than a direct response to having unjustly harmed specific individuals (as is the case for personal emissions). Broome suggests that efficient policies, guided by goodness, can often achieve significant climate mitigation without necessarily requiring immense sacrifice from the current generation.
