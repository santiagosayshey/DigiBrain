> [!motivation] A Threat to Humanity
>
> Climate change represents a significant and credible threat to global well-being. Scientific consensus indicates that the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by approximately $1^\circ C$ over the last century. This warming trend, primarily driven by human activities, is causing substantial environmental disruption.
> - **Consequences:** Observable effects include rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (heatwaves, droughts, floods), ocean acidification, and widespread impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity.
> - **Causes:** The primary driver is the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) resulting from human activities. Key sources include the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, industrial processes, deforestation, and certain agricultural practices. Establishing this reality is crucial for understanding the ethical dimensions that follow.

> [!consider] 2015 Paris Climate Agreement
>
> The Paris Agreement is a landmark international treaty adopted in 2015 by nearly every country. Its central aim is to limit global warming to well below $2^\circ C$, preferably to $1.5^\circ C$, compared to pre-industrial levels.
> - **Mechanism:** It operates through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), where each country sets its own targets for emission reductions and reports on progress.
> - **Ethical Context:** The agreement implicitly acknowledges a collective responsibility to address climate change. However, it primarily focuses on governmental actions. This sets the stage for debates, such as those explored by Broome, regarding the specific moral obligations of governments versus those of individuals in mitigating climate change harms.

> [!consider] Broome's Glossary
>
> John Broome, an economist and philosopher, analyzes the ethics of climate change by distinguishing between two spheres of morality:
> - **Public Morality:** This concerns the moral duties and responsibilities of governments and other public institutions. In the context of climate change, this involves decisions about national policies, regulations, and international cooperation.
> - **Private Morality:** This concerns the moral duties and responsibilities of private individuals in their personal capacity. This relates to individual actions, consumption patterns, and personal contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.

> [!idea] Broome's View
>
> Broome argues that climate change imposes distinct moral obligations within both public and private morality. He differentiates between:
> - **Duties of Goodness:** Obligations to promote well-being and make the world better. Broome generally assigns these duties primarily to governments in the climate context, involving actions like efficient resource management and cost-benefit analysis for the public good.
> - **Duties of Justice:** Obligations related to fairness, rights, and not harming others. Crucially, Broome challenges the common assumption that only governments bear responsibility for climate action. He contends that *individuals* have a stringent duty of justice concerning their personal emissions, specifically the duty not to cause harm without compensation. Governments, in his view, do not bear this same kind of duty of justice directly, though their policies (driven by goodness) impact justice outcomes.

> [!idea] Private Morality
>
> Broome posits that individual greenhouse gas emissions constitute an injustice – a violation of the duty not to harm others. He argues that individuals must not emit greenhouse gases unless they compensate for the harm caused by their emissions. This duty stems from the moral principle that one should not harm others. He provides seven characteristics of emission-causing activities to support this claim:
> 1.  **Causality:** The harm resulting from climate change (e.g., impacts of storms, sea-level rise) is a direct result of actions we take (emitting GHGs).
> 2.  **Severity:** The harm caused by climate change is serious, potentially leading to death, displacement, and loss of livelihood for many.
> 3.  **Intentionality:** The harm is not accidental; emitting GHGs is a known consequence of many common activities (driving, flying, consuming energy).
> 4.  **Lack of Compensation:** Generally, individuals do not compensate the specific people harmed by their personal emissions.
> 5.  **Selfishness:** Many emissions result from activities undertaken for personal benefit or convenience, where the harm falls disproportionately on others.
> 6.  **Non-Reciprocity:** The harm is often inflicted by wealthier individuals/nations upon poorer ones, who contribute less to the problem and are more vulnerable to its effects.
> 7.  **Feasibility of Reduction:** Individuals possess the means to reduce their emissions significantly without undue sacrifice.

> [!consider] Broome's Demands
>
> Broome argues that the duty of justice requires individuals to ensure their actions do not result in net harm through emissions. He explores ways to fulfill this duty:
> - **Direct Compensation:** Paying specific individuals harmed by one's emissions. Broome acknowledges this is impractical due to the dispersed, numerous, and often unidentifiable nature of victims.
> - **International Aid:** Donating to aid organizations. While potentially helpful, this doesn't directly fulfill the duty of justice owed to specific individuals harmed by one's *own* emissions.
> - **Reduction and Offsetting:** Broome concludes the most feasible approach is twofold:
>     - First, reduce personal emissions as much as practically possible.
>     - Second, offset the remaining unavoidable emissions to achieve a net-zero personal impact.
> Broome intends this not as an extreme demand but as a requirement of basic justice (not harming others).

> [!idea] Offsetting
>
> Fulfilling the individual duty of justice, according to Broome, primarily involves minimizing and neutralizing one's personal carbon footprint.
> - **Reduction:** This entails actively modifying behaviour to decrease emissions. Examples include:
>     - Reducing energy consumption (e.g., improving home insulation, using less heating/cooling).
>     - Minimizing waste (e.g., reducing consumption, recycling).
>     - Adopting lower-carbon transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, public transport, less flying).
>     - Changing dietary habits (e.g., reducing meat consumption).
>     - Consuming locally sourced goods.
> - **Offsetting:** For emissions that cannot be eliminated, individuals must ensure an equivalent amount of greenhouse gas is removed from the atmosphere.
>     - This means achieving 'carbon neutrality' for one's lifestyle.
>     - Methods include funding reputable carbon offsetting projects (e.g., reforestation, renewable energy development, methane capture).
>     - Calculating the exact offset needed is complex, often requiring estimation (Broome suggests overestimation to be safe).
>
> **Author's Note:** Broome's focus on individual justice through offsetting faces criticism. Assigning this complex calculation and moral weight primarily to individuals, while admitting its practical difficulties, seems potentially naive. Critics argue that systemic change driven by governments, capable of large-scale measurement and enforcement (e.g., via carbon taxes or cap-and-trade), is essential for effective and equitable climate action, rather than relying solely on individual, often hard-to-verify, acts of justice.

> [!idea] Public Morality
>
> Broome assigns governments duties of *goodness* regarding climate change. This means governments are morally obligated to act in ways that promote the overall well-being of their citizens and, to some extent, the global population. Their actions should be guided by principles aimed at achieving the best possible outcomes given the challenge of climate change.

> [!idea] Efficiency and Externalities (A Primary Strategy)
>
> As part of their duty of goodness, Broome argues governments should primarily focus on promoting **economic efficiency** regarding climate change. This strategy addresses the core problem of *externalities*:
> - Emitters impose climate damage costs on others without paying for them, an inefficient *market failure*.
> - Policies like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade aim to correct this inefficiency by "internalizing the externality."
> - Broome views achieving efficiency improvements, ideally *Pareto improvements* (benefiting some without harming others), as a central way governments can fulfill their duty to manage resources well for collective benefit.

> [!idea] Optimisation (A Cautious Aim)
>
> While pursuing efficiency is key, the duty of goodness might also suggest aiming for **optimisation** – policies maximizing the *total* overall good (using cost-benefit analysis). However, Broome advises caution with this aim:
> - Strict optimisation might require actions that, while increasing the total good, impose unfair burdens on some individuals or groups, potentially violating justice.
> - Therefore, while cost-benefit analysis is a vital government tool (part of goodness), Broome suggests prioritising clear efficiency gains over optimisation strategies that risk being unjust. Improving outcomes fairly is often preferable.

> [!idea] Compensation (A Supporting Tool)
>
> Within the government's duty of goodness, **compensation** functions primarily as a **tool** to support strategies like pursuing efficiency, rather than being a standalone goal itself or a direct governmental duty of justice.
> - When efficiency policies (like carbon taxes) cause negative side effects for some (e.g., higher costs), governments can use revenues for compensation.
> - This makes the primary policy fairer and more acceptable, thereby helping the government successfully implement actions that promote overall well-being (goodness). It helps ensure that the pursuit of efficiency doesn't unduly harm vulnerable populations.

> [!consider] Government Duties: Compensation, Efficiency & Optimisation
>
> Under the government's **duty of goodness** regarding climate change, several interconnected strategies are considered within Broome's framework. One specific interpretation emphasizes the following roles and rationale:
>
> | Concept           | Role/Goal                                                                          | Evaluation (Based on Specific Interpretation)                                       |
> | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | **Compensation** | Using policy revenues or funds to offset negative impacts or costs of climate action on individuals/groups. | **Key Aim (with Efficiency):** Seen as crucial for enabling emission reductions *without sacrifice* by ensuring fairness. |
> | **Efficiency** | Implementing policies (like carbon pricing) to correct market failures and reduce emissions cost-effectively.  | **Key Aim (with Compensation):** Also crucial for enabling reductions *without societal sacrifice* by improving welfare. |
> | **Optimisation** | Using cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to evaluate policies and aim for the maximum overall societal good.        | **Guiding Tool:** Informs policy choices under 'goodness', but must be balanced with justice concerns. |
>
> **Rationale Emphasized:**
> This interpretation highlights Broome's argument that governments, acting from their duty of goodness, should aim for **Compensation and Efficiency** specifically because these approaches create conditions where emission reductions can occur **without imposing a sacrifice** on individuals or society. This linkage makes them central to ethically acceptable and effective climate policy in this view. **Optimisation** serves as a tool for evaluation within this framework.
