> [!motivation] Climate Change: The Problem and Its Moral Questions
> The Earth's average temperature has risen by about $1^{\circ}C$ in the last century, mainly because of greenhouse gases released from burning fossil fuels.
> - **Effects**: This causes sea levels to rise, leads to more extreme weather, and harms natural systems. These effects cause real harm to people and the environment.
> - **Key Moral Questions**: This situation makes us ask:
>     - How should we balance the cost of reducing emissions now against the harm climate change could cause in the future?
>     - How do we decide what to do when we are uncertain about the exact future impacts?
>     - Who is responsible for fixing a problem largely caused by the combined emissions of many people over time?

> [!consider] The Paris Agreement: Global Goals and Remaining Questions
> The 2015 Paris Agreement is a global treaty where countries agreed to try and limit global warming to well below $2^{\circ}C$, aiming for $1.5^{\circ}C$.
> - **How it Works**: Countries set their own targets (Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) for cutting emissions.
> - **What it Means Ethically**:
>     - It shows global agreement that action is needed and provides common goals.
>     - However, it focuses on what countries promise, not directly on the moral duties of individuals.
>     - It doesn't fully answer complex questions about fairness between current and future generations.
