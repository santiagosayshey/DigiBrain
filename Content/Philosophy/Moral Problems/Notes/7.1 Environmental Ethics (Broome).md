## 1. Objective: Create Clear, Modular Notes

Hello! Let's create some notes on the topic specified below.

- **Topic for Notes:** `[Environmental Ethics (Broome)]`

I need these notes to be:

- **Concise & Modular:** Easy to digest in distinct blocks.
- **Focused on Key Ideas:** Highlight the core concepts for understanding.
- **Synthesized:** Please process and explain the information, not just copy text from sources.
- **Formatted with Callouts:** Structure the entire output using the 'callout' blocks defined below.

**Do not** provide a preliminary outline or introduction. Generate the final formatted note directly.

## 2. Callout Formatting Guide

Structure the notes using 'callout' blocks. Each block starts with `>` on every line, with the first line defining the type and title:

Markdown

```
> [!callout_type] Title of Callout
>
> Content for the callout goes here.
> - Bullet points can be used for lists.
> Further explanations or details.
```

- **Titles:** Keep titles informative and brief (e.g., `Kruskal's Algorithm`, `Network Cost Problem`). Avoid generic placeholders like `Main Idea Here`.
- **Content:** Tailor the content within each callout based on its defined purpose (see section 3).

## 3. Callout Type Definitions

Here are the available callout types. Use them as appropriate for the content. The descriptions clarify the intended _purpose_ of each type:

### `> [!motivation] Motivation`

- **Purpose**: Sets the context. Introduce the problem, need, or scenario that the main topic addresses. _Do not include the solution itself here._
- **Elements**: Describe the challenge or situation; outline the specific issues needing resolution.
- **Example (MST Context)**: Minimizing cost (like cable length) when connecting multiple points in a network, while ensuring full connectivity, presents a common optimization challenge.

### `> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept`

- **Purpose**: Explains the core solution, definition, or algorithm.
- **Elements**: Clearly define the concept; describe how it works; link it back to solving the problem stated in the motivation.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Kruskal's Algorithm identifies a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in weighted, undirected graphs. It greedily adds the lowest-weight edge available that doesn't create a cycle, continuing until all vertices are connected.

### `> [!example] Example or Illustration`

- **Purpose**: Provides a concrete demonstration of the idea in action.
- **Elements**: Show a specific case, walk through steps, use diagrams (described), or illustrate the outcome. Explain _how_ the example demonstrates the concept.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Given a graph, Kruskal's first sorts edges by weight. It then adds edges like AB (weight 1), CD (weight 2), AC (weight 3), skipping edges like BD (weight 4) if adding it would form a cycle, until an MST is formed.

### `> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas`

- **Purpose**: Adds depth by exploring related topics, nuances, limitations, or advanced aspects.
- **Elements**: Discuss broader implications, related theories, implementation details (like data structures), edge cases, or variations.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Cycle detection in Kruskal's is often efficiently handled by a Union-Find data structure. The algorithm's time complexity is typically influenced by edge sorting and Union-Find operations (O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)). Consider Prim's algorithm as an alternative MST approach.

### `> [!summary] Summary of Key Concepts`

- **Purpose**: Briefly recap main points from previous callouts. **Only use when specifically requested.**
- **Format**: Use bullet points. Start each point with the **bolded topic** followed by a 1-2 sentence summary. Focus on _what_ the concepts are.
- **Good Example**:
    - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: A subset of edges connecting all vertices in a graph with the minimum possible total weight without cycles.
    - **Greedy Algorithm**: An approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each step; Kruskal's is an example.
- **Avoid**: Summarizing the structure of the notes themselves (e.g., "We discussed the motivation, then the idea...").

## 4. Allowed Formatting Within Callouts

You can enhance callouts with:

- **Tables**: Use standard Markdown.
```markdown
| Algorithm | Complexity | Notes           |
| :-------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| Kruskal's | O(E log E) | Requires sorting |
| Prim's    | O(E log V) | Using Fibonacci heap |
```
    
- **Images**: Mark placement with a placeholder block. **Provide a clear description** of the desired image and use the Obsidian wikilink format `![[ImageName.png]]`.
```image-goes-here
Description: Diagram comparing the edge selection process of Kruskal's vs Prim's algorithm on the same sample graph. Kruskal's focuses on global lowest edge, Prim's grows from a starting node.
![[kruskal_vs_prim_comparison.png]]
```

- **Math**: Use LaTeX delimiters.
    - Inline: `$O(N^2)$`
    - Block:
```math
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi
$$
```
        
## 5. Specific Callout Sequence Interpretation

Check the table below. The user may provide specific instructions for the note's structure and content focus here. Your action depends on the state of this table in the user's request:

- **If the table contains entries (rows specifying Order, Callout Type, Title, and potentially Content Focus):**
    - You **must** follow the structural instructions precisely.
    - Generate the note using the exact sequence, `[!callout type]`, and `Title` provided in each row.
    - Do **not** add, remove, or reorder the callouts relative to the specified sequence.
    - It is imperative that you write **ONLY** the provided callouts and nothing more or less. 
    - Consult the **Content Focus / Notes** column for each row. If notes are provided, use them as **guidance** regarding the _information_, _key points_, or _emphasis_ the user wants within that specific callout.
    - **Important Constraint:** These notes are **high-level pointers**, _not_ prescriptive text or rigid formatting rules. They should inform the _content_ you generate but **must not dictate** your specific wording, sentence structure, or the overall objective writing style required by this prompt. Think of them as hints for _what_ to cover or emphasize, allowing you to still synthesize and formulate the explanation clearly and objectively.
    - Ensure the final content generated for each callout aligns with its specified `[!callout type]` and `Title`, while incorporating the thematic guidance from the notes column where provided and applicable.
- **If the table is empty or absent:**
    - You have the flexibility to determine the most effective sequence, types of callouts (e.g., `[!motivation]`, `[!idea]`, `[!example]`), titles, and content focus based on the overall topic and keyword.

_(The table structure below illustrates the format the user employs. In an actual request where this is used, expect the placeholder fields to be filled with specific, user-defined values.)_

| **Order** | **Callout Type** | **Title Placeholder**        | **Content Focus / Notes (Optional Guidance)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 6. CRITICAL: Content & Formatting Rules

**Follow these instructions meticulously:**

1.  **Objective Language:** Be neutral and factual. Describe _what_ things are and _how_ they work.
    * _Avoid:_ "This essential step significantly improves efficiency."
    * _Prefer:_ "This step uses data structure X to perform Y."

2.  **Structure: Extreme Conciseness, MANDATORY Segmentation & Internal Variety:**
    * **Core Principle:** Notes **must** be aggressively concise and modular. Break information into the *absolute smallest* logical units (segmentation between callouts).
    * **Internal Structure MANDATE:** Within **each and every** callout, you **must** use a **mix of formatting elements**. You cannot create callouts containing *only* a single paragraph of text, nor callouts containing *only* a list of bullet points. Combine elements appropriately for clarity and adherence to this rule.
        * *Examples of Required Internal Structure:*
            * A brief introductory sentence (1-2 short sentences max) followed by 1-3 highly focused bullet points.
            * A short statement paired with a small, relevant table.
            * A couple of very short, distinct sentences addressing the micro-topic.
    * **Techniques:** Use very short sentences, minimal bullet points (1-3 items max per list, single micro-topic), compact tables. Eliminate *all* unnecessary words.
    * **Strictly Prohibited:**
        * **Callouts containing ONLY one block of paragraph text.** (Direct violation).
        * **Callouts containing ONLY a list of bullet points.** (Direct violation).
        * Any paragraph *within* a callout longer than 2-3 short sentences.
        * Bullet lists covering multiple distinct ideas or having more than 2-3 brief items.
        * Any form of "information dumping".
    * **MANDATORY Segmentation (Between Callouts):** If a point requires more than minimal explanation, or involves multiple distinct facets:
        * **DO NOT** create one long callout.
        * **DO** break it down into **multiple, shorter, highly focused callouts**. Use specific titles for each. (e.g., An `[!idea]` for a definition, followed by another `[!idea]` or `[!consider]` for its main implication, followed by an `[!example]`).
    * **Start Content on New Line:** Always begin content on the line _after_ the `> [!type] Title` header.

3.  **No Evaluations:** Do not insert opinions or judgments about the utility or correctness of the concepts.

4.  **Callout Length - Enforce Brevity:**
    * **Target Brevity:** Actively enforce conciseness. As a **strong guideline**, aim for **approximately 3-5 sentences OR 50-75 words maximum** per callout total content. Treat this as a target ceiling, not a floor. This limit applies to the *combined elements* within the callout, which itself must adhere to the internal structure mandate (Rule #2).
    * **Justify Exceeding Target:** Only exceed this guideline *minimally* if explaining a *single, indivisible point* is impossible otherwise, AND the result still adheres strictly to Rule #2 (no dense blocks/lists AND internal variety mandate).
    * **Segmentation Over Length:** The principle of **extreme segmentation (Rule #2, both between and within callouts) always takes precedence**. It is strongly preferred to have multiple short, focused callouts than a single one approaching or exceeding the length guideline or violating the internal structure mandate.
    * `[!summary]` remains exception: 1-2 sentences per bullet (inherently mixed structure if multiple points exist).

5.  **Final Output Wrapper:** The **entire** note, including all `>` lines for all callouts, **must** be enclosed in a single Markdown code block:

```markdown
> [!motivation] Example Title
> Brief sentence.
> - Focused bullet point.

> [!idea] Another Title
> Short statement 1.
> Short statement 2.
```


**Checklist (Internal AI Use):**

* [ ] Language is objective and non-judgmental?
* [ ] Content is **aggressively** concise and segmented **between** callouts (Rule #2)?
* [ ] **Internal structure uses a mix of formats? (CRITICAL: Not just paragraph, not just bullets?) (Rule #2)?**
* [ ] Avoided prohibited structures (long paras/lists/dumps)? Used segmentation as default?
* [ ] Callout content starts on a new line below the header?
* [ ] **Callout lengths strictly adhere to brevity target (approx. 3-5 sentences/50-75 words max), with segmentation prioritized over length?**
* [ ] Followed specific callout sequence if table was provided?
* [ ] Final output is fully wrapped in ` ```markdown ... ``` `?
* [ ] **Self-Correction Applied: Final review explicitly confirms all above rules, especially #2 (Segmentation & *Internal Variety*) and #4 (Length), are met?**
