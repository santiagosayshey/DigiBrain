> [!motivation] Climate Change as a Pressing Issue
> The scientific consensus points to significant alterations in the global climate system.
> - Global average surface temperature has increased by approximately $1^{\circ}C$ over the last century.
> - Observed consequences include rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems.
> - The primary driver identified is the emission of greenhouse gases, largely from the burning of fossil fuels for energy, industry, transport, and agriculture.

> [!consider] The 2015 Paris Agreement
> The Paris Agreement is an international treaty adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in 2015.
> - **Goal**: To limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to $1.5$ degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.
> - **Mechanism**: Requires countries to set nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and report regularly on emissions and implementation efforts.
> - **Context**: It represents a global consensus on the need for climate action, framing discussions around the responsibilities of governments and potentially individuals to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
