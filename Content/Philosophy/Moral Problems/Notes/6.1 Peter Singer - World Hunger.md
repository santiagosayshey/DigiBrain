> |Africa|20%|~250 million|
> |Asia|8.6%|~418 million|
> |Latin America|7%|~42 million|

> The persistence and severity of world hunger raise crucial ethical questions: **Do individuals, governments, or affluent societies have a moral obligation to aid the world's poor?** If so, how strong or binding is this obligation? Alternatively, should such aid be viewed merely as charitable generosity rather than a duty of justice?

> [!idea] Justice vs. Charity
> 
> Distinguishing between charity and justice is essential for addressing ethical obligations towards global poverty.
> 
> - **Justice** involves actions owed as moral or ethical duties. Failing to act justly constitutes wrongdoing or injustice.
>     
> - **Charity** refers to voluntary giving or assistance beyond moral obligations. Charity is commendable but not ethically mandatory.
>     
> 
> The ethical debate on world hunger revolves around classifying aid as justice (mandatory ethical duty) or charity (optional generosity).
