> [!motivation] Critical Thinking
> 
> In today's information-saturated environment, we face a constant barrage of messages, claims, and appeals designed to influence our decisions. From marketing and media to personal communications, distinguishing reliable information from manipulation requires specific cognitive skills. Without these skills, we risk making decisions based on incomplete or misleading information.

> [!idea] Uncritical Thinking
> 
> Uncritical thinking **accepts information at face value** without examining its validity or considering alternatives.
> 
> - Relies on emotional appeals rather than evidence
> - Accepts claims based on authority rather than merit
> - Fails to identify logical fallacies or inconsistencies
> 
> |Characteristic|Result|
> |---|---|
> |Confirmation bias|Seeking only information that supports existing beliefs|
> |Appeal to emotion|Making decisions based on feelings rather than facts|
> |Black and white thinking|Seeing issues as having only two possible positions|

> [!idea] Critical Thinking
> 
> Critical thinking involves systematically **evaluating information through analysis, interpretation, and reasoned judgment before accepting it as valid.**
> 
> - Examines assumptions, evidence, and reasoning
> - Requires recognition of biases (both in sources and ourselves)
> - Involves questioning rather than passive acceptance
> 
> |Component|Function|
> |---|---|
> |Analysis|Breaking down complex information into parts|
> |Evaluation|Assessing credibility and logical strength|
> |Inference|Drawing reasonable conclusions from evidence|
> |Self-regulation|Monitoring one's own thinking process|

> [!example] Phishing Email Analysis
> 
> **Email Content:** "URGENT: Your account has been compromised. Click here immediately to verify your details or your account will be terminated within 24 hours. - PayBal Security Team"
> 
> **Uncritical Thinking Approach:**
> 
> - Reacts immediately to urgent tone and threat of account termination
> - Focuses on fear of losing account access rather than evaluating message authenticity
> - Clicks provided link without verifying where it actually leads
> - Enters personal information based solely on the email's request
> 
> **Critical Thinking Approach:**
> 
> - Checks sender email address for legitimacy (not just display name)
> - Questions urgency and threat-based language designed to provoke immediate action
> - Notices spelling inconsistencies in company name ("PayBal" vs "PayPal")
> - Verifies independently by contacting the company through official channels

> [!consider] Emotions and Critical Thinking
> 
> Emotions play an integral role in decision-making and cannot be completely separated from rational thought processes.
> 
> - Acknowledging emotions allows for their appropriate inclusion in decision processes
> - Suppressing emotions doesn't eliminate their influenceâ€”it removes awareness of their impact
> - Emotional awareness enables evaluation of whether feelings are proportionate to situations
> 
> Responsible critical thinking involves:
> 
> - Recognizing when emotions are influencing judgment
> - Pausing before making emotion-driven decisions
> - Using emotions as data points rather than dismissing them entirely

| 1. They say it's probably the best beer in the world? It must be great: I'll buy some.                                       | No                                                 | It's taking the information at face value without ever considering the alternative - that it's not the best beer in the world. The statement fails to consider subjectivity - do you like every other foods / drinks that other people consider "great"? Probably not, right?                                                                                                 |
| 2. She wrote the world's leading psychology text-book: her views on psychology must be worth taking seriously.               | In the middle                                      | It considers the possibility that her views are valid, that is to say, the person allows themselves to be convinced by their views, not that their views are right. However, we should also question where this information about "worlds leading textbook" came from. How do we know this is true? Have we verified it?                                                      |
| 3. She wrote the world's leading psychology text-book: her views on the PlayStation 4 must be worth taking seriously.        | No                                                 | The assertion here has nothing to do with prior evidence, critical thinking would question why being a psychology expert makes her opinion on games consoles valid                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4. French fries are delicious. I'm going to eat them all the time.                                                           | In the middle                                      | It really depends on what matters to you here. If your only goal is to enjoy food, then youve outlined all the evidence and come to a reasonable conclusion. food is good, therefore i should eat it. However, what if we consider health? Are french fries healthy? Not really - and maybe i should consider again if i should eat them all the time.                        |
| 5. My friend has hurt his leg and is lying close to me, in pain: I must rush and help him right now.                         | In the middle                                      | This is similar to the french fry example. With the limited evidence, it seems logical to make a decision like that. However, what if we consider other things - like how his friend hurt his leg. If I am with him, and he is hurt, am I hurt too? I should also consider that before trying to help someone else.                                                           |
| 6. My friend has hurt his leg and is lying on the other side of that busy road, in pain: I must rush and help him right now. | In the middle, but more critical than the last one | This is the same reasoning as last time, but the person now considers the environment at hand. It would be uncritical to not think about the busy road, not the act of defying it. You can still critically analyse something as perhaps dangerous, but choosing to do it, even despite the evidence is not uncritical in and of itself. Dangerous maybe, but not uncritical. |
| 7. The video my friend posted on Facebook is really funny. I'm going to click 'like'.                                        | No                                                 | No, but i think questioning whether this is crtical thinking or not is arbitrary at best, anxiety at worst. You shouldn't need to critically analyse everything. If we did, we'd all be agoraphobic.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 8. The video my friend posted on Facebook is pathetic. I'm going to post an insulting personal comment.                      | No                                                 | The person fails to consider reasons why they should not say something so drastic. They fail to even consider why something is pathetic and why pathetic things require insults. Why should we be critical over this post and not the last one? Because we are                                                                                                                |
