Philosophy is about *learning how to think* in more sophisticated, nuanced and rigorous ways.
- How to construct and evaluate arguments
- How to identify hidden assumptions
- How to consider multiple perspectives
- How to question the obvious
- How to define and clarify precisely
- How to connect unrelated ideas

Reading philosophy helps us to witness these thinking processes in action through the work of great minds, absorb their methods through exposure, and practice these skills by engaging directly with challenging texts.

- Shows us masterful thinking modeled on the page
- Forces us to slow down and follow complex reasoning step by step
- Exposes us to historically influential ideas in their original form
- Challenges us to interpret difficult passages, building analytical strength
- Provides concrete examples of argument structures we can learn from
- Creates a direct dialogue between our mind and the philosopher's

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Before Reading** | Identify the central problem/question   | For an ethics reading: "Is it ever okay to lie?"                                                                                                                                              |
|                    | Note historical context and influences  | Written after World War II, when people were questioning moral absolutes                                                                                                                      |
|                    | Set one specific question for this text | "Does the author think there are exceptions to telling the truth?"                                                                                                                            |
| **During Reading** | Map arguments visually                  | Simple argument about lying:<br>Premise 1: Causing harm to innocent people is wrong<br>Premise 2: Some lies prevent harm to innocent people<br>Conclusion: Therefore, some lies are not wrong |
|                    | Write dialogue with the author          | When author says "Truth is always best":<br>Me: "But what about white lies that spare feelings?"<br>Author might respond: "Even small lies can damage trust over time"                        |
|                    | Highlight core principles               | From a reading on friendship:<br>1. True friendship is based on mutual respect<br>2. Friends want what's best for each other<br>3. Friendship requires honesty                                |
|                    | Create examples of abstract concepts    | For "justice": When siblings split a cookie exactly in half, that's an example of equal distribution as justice                                                                               |
|                    | Note agreements/disagreements           | "I agree that we should help others when we can, but disagree that we must always put others before ourselves"                                                                                |
| **After Reading**  | Translate a key concept                 | "Free will" in my words: "Being able to make choices that aren't completely forced by outside factors"<br>My example: Deciding what to study in college despite family pressure               |
|                    | Identify challenged beliefs             | This reading challenged my belief that being "good" always means following rules                                                                                                              |
|                    | Formulate strongest objection           | The author claims people are naturally selfish, but what about when people spontaneously help strangers with no benefit to themselves?                                                        |
|                    | Connect to problems you care about      | How this discussion of fairness relates to dividing chores with my roommates                                                                                                                  |
|                    | One idea worth keeping                  | The idea that listening well to others is an ethical action, not just a social skill                                                                                                          |
