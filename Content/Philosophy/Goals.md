Philosophy is about *learning how to think* in more sophisticated, nuanced and rigorous ways.
- How to construct and evaluate arguments
- How to identify hidden assumptions
- How to consider multiple perspectives
- How to question the obvious
- How to define and clarify precisely
- How to connect unrelated ideas

Reading philosophy helps us to witness these thinking processes in action through the work of great minds, absorb their methods through exposure, and practice these skills by engaging directly with challenging texts.

- Shows us masterful thinking modeled on the page
- Forces us to slow down and follow complex reasoning step by step
- Exposes us to historically influential ideas in their original form
- Challenges us to interpret difficult passages, building analytical strength
- Provides concrete examples of argument structures we can learn from
- Creates a direct dialogue between our mind and the philosopher's
