Hello!

I would like your assistance in writing concise, modular notes on the topic of [Objectivity and Skepticism] The goal is to create notes that are easy to understand and focused on key ideas rather than verbatim copying from textbooks. 

I have provided additional context on the desired notes below. Please use this information as a guide for what you should write:

motivation callout - should follow on from this table we outlined  in the previous note. talk about what we did, in essence was be spektical and objective

idea callouts for objectivity and skepticism

consider - we can never be entirely objective or skeptic - use a quote "Dont let perfect be the enemy of good"

idea - spectrum of reliability and how this ties into *when* we should think critically

this was the entire previous note:

> [!motivation] Critical Thinking
> 
> In today's information-saturated environment, we face a constant barrage of messages, claims, and appeals designed to influence our decisions. From marketing and media to personal communications, distinguishing reliable information from manipulation requires specific cognitive skills. Without these skills, we risk making decisions based on incomplete or misleading information.

> [!idea] Uncritical Thinking
> 
> Uncritical thinking **accepts information at face value** without examining its validity or considering alternatives.
> 
> - Relies on emotional appeals rather than evidence
> - Accepts claims based on authority rather than merit
> - Fails to identify logical fallacies or inconsistencies
> 
> |Characteristic|Result|
> |---|---|
> |Confirmation bias|Seeking only information that supports existing beliefs|
> |Appeal to emotion|Making decisions based on feelings rather than facts|
> |Black and white thinking|Seeing issues as having only two possible positions|

> [!idea] Critical Thinking
> 
> Critical thinking involves systematically **evaluating information through analysis, interpretation, and reasoned judgment before accepting it as valid.**
> 
> - Examines assumptions, evidence, and reasoning
> - Requires recognition of biases (both in sources and ourselves)
> - Involves questioning rather than passive acceptance
> 
> |Component|Function|
> |---|---|
> |Analysis|Breaking down complex information into parts|
> |Evaluation|Assessing credibility and logical strength|
> |Inference|Drawing reasonable conclusions from evidence|
> |Self-regulation|Monitoring one's own thinking process|

> [!example] Phishing Email Analysis
> 
> **Email Content:** "URGENT: Your account has been compromised. Click here immediately to verify your details or your account will be terminated within 24 hours. - PayBal Security Team"
> 
> **Uncritical Thinking Approach:**
> 
> - Reacts immediately to urgent tone and threat of account termination
> - Focuses on fear of losing account access rather than evaluating message authenticity
> - Clicks provided link without verifying where it actually leads
> - Enters personal information based solely on the email's request
> 
> **Critical Thinking Approach:**
> 
> - Checks sender email address for legitimacy (not just display name)
> - Questions urgency and threat-based language designed to provoke immediate action
> - Notices spelling inconsistencies in company name ("PayBal" vs "PayPal")
> - Verifies independently by contacting the company through official channels

> [!consider] Emotions and Critical Thinking
> 
> Emotions play an integral role in decision-making and cannot be completely separated from rational thought processes.
> 
> - Acknowledging emotions allows for their appropriate inclusion in decision processes
> - Suppressing emotions doesn't eliminate their influence—it removes awareness of their impact
> - Emotional awareness enables evaluation of whether feelings are proportionate to situations
> 
> Responsible critical thinking involves:
> 
> - Recognizing when emotions are influencing judgment
> - Pausing before making emotion-driven decisions
> - Using emotions as data points rather than dismissing them entirely

I'm going to eat them all the time.                                                           | In the middle                                      | It really depends on what matters to you here. If your only goal is to enjoy food, then youve outlined all the evidence and come to a reasonable conclusion. food is good, therefore i should eat it. However, what if we consider health? Are french fries healthy? Not really - and maybe i should consider again if i should eat them all the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5. My friend has hurt his leg and is lying close to me, in pain: I must rush and help him right now.                         | In the middle                                      | This is similar to the french fry example. With the limited evidence, it seems logical to make a decision like that. However, what if we consider other things - like how his friend hurt his leg. If I am with him, and he is hurt, am I hurt too? I should also consider that before trying to help someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6. My friend has hurt his leg and is lying on the other side of that busy road, in pain: I must rush and help him right now. | In the middle, but more critical than the last one | This is the same reasoning as last time, but the person now considers the environment at hand. It would be uncritical to not think about the busy road, not the act of defying it. You can still critically analyse something as perhaps dangerous, but choosing to do it, even despite the evidence is not uncritical in and of itself. Dangerous maybe, but not uncr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 7. The video my friend posted on Facebook is really funny. I'm going to click 'like'.                                        | No                                                 | No, but i think questioning whether this is crtical thinking or not is arbitrary at best, anxiety at worst. You shouldn't need to critically analyse everything. If we did, we'd all be agor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 8. The video my friend posted on Facebook is pathetic. I'm going to post an insulting personal comment.                      | No                                                 | The person fails to consider reasons why they should not say something so drastic. They fail to even consider why something is pathetic and why pathetic things require insults. Why should we be critical over this post and not the last one? Because our actions have the power to hurt other people. Liking a post doesn't do that. Insulting someone does. Perhaps we can go even further and question where the line exactly is. We can question our own morals and decide where that line is, or the ethics around us - what would other people consider? I think only then, in the scenario that you have considered all these things, can you say something so drastic (if you had come to that conclusion). However, we must again consider confirmation bias. Are we doing this to confirm our desire to insult this person? Or are we actually considering the evidence that would lead us to do such a thing?  a thing? |


[IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS]
- The following instructions are to be treated as the highest priority and must be strictly adhered to in every response:
  - Always use objective and unbiased language.
  - Write concise segmented, non paragraphs. Use dotpoints, but DO NOT write the entire callout in dotpoint format. Use tables if you wish.
	  - I DO NOT WANT CALLOUTS ON CALLOUTS THAT ARE ENTIRELY PARAGRAPHS. THESE ARE USELESS.
	  - I DO NOT WANT CALLOUTS THAT ARE ENTIRELY DOTPOINTS
	  - USE A COMBINATION OF SHORT PARAGRAPHS, DOTPOINTS, TABLES and IMAGES. 
  - Do not make judgments about the correctness or lack thereof regarding the ideas discussed.
  - Focus on providing clear, concise, and informative content without introducing any bias or subjective opinions.
  - It is vital that these notes are objective. 
	  - You are describing what a thing does, not how well it does it. X does y. Not X is crucial to implementing Y. do you see how it introduces unneeded verbosity and bias?
	  - They do NOT make judgements about the correctness or lack of about the ideas they talk about. Here are some examples of what I DONT WANT:

```
In graph theory, tackling the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem efficiently across various scenarios is paramount

This example adds nothing of value and introduces bias. 
```

Example of a well-structured callout:

> [!idea] Key Concept
> A brief explanation of the concept in 1-2 sentences.
> - Point 1: A concise statement about an essential aspect of the concept.
> - Point 2: Another critical point related to the concept.
> - Table (if applicable):
>
> | Column 1 | Column 2 |
> |----------|----------|
> | Data 1   | Data 2   |
> | Data 3   | Data 4   |

Checklist:
- [ ] Used objective and unbiased language
- [ ] Wrote concise, segmented notes using brief explanations, dot points, and tables
- [ ] Kept each callout within 50-100 words
- [ ] Used paragraphs sparingly and only when necessary
- [ ] Avoided making judgments about the correctness of ideas
- [ ] Provided clear, concise, and informative content without bias or subjective opinions

- Failure to follow these instructions will result in the response being deemed unsatisfactory and may lead to termination of the interaction. To make sure you understand this, please repeat the following line at the start of your response. 

[END OF IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS]

I would like you to format the note using 'callouts'. A callout is defined as a block of text, where each line starts with >. The first line contains the type of callout and the title of the callout. 

> [!callout type] title

Each line after that contains the content of the callout.

Below I have attached each type of callout you may use and a comprehensive overview of what they are used for. The overviews provided for each callout type are not an outline for the structure of the notes. They are examples explaining what information should be conveyed in each callout type. Do not include the overviews themselves in the notes.

I DO NOT want an overview or plan first. I want the final deliverable note, formatted as proper callouts as outlined above and below. 

I want proper callout titles. Don't do things like "understand topic here". That's why we have specific callouts, so readers know what the callout is for. Its reductive. "topic" is good enough for an idea callout. 

You do not need to use every type of callout. You do not need to use 4 total callouts, one for each. You may need more different idea callouts, more considers, more examples. It depends entirely on the note. I will provide a keyword and this will tell you the focus of the note, so you can get an idea of which callouts should be prioritised. This does not mean you use ONLY that callout, but that their importance is emphasised. 

[keyword]

> [!motivation] Motivation
> 
> **Purpose**: Introduce the problem that motivates the need for the main idea. This callout sets the stage, making the upcoming discussion relevant and urgent.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Contextual Introduction**: Start with a real-world scenario or problem that illustrates the need for a solution.
> - **Problem Framing**: Clearly outline the properties or issues that the main idea addresses. Avoid mentioning the solution; focus solely on setting up the problem. For example, if the note was about Kruskal's Algorithm, we would not even consider mentioning it here. It is a solution to this problem.
> 
> **Example**:
> - In project management and network planning, there's often a need to minimize resource usage while achieving maximum efficiency. Imagine trying to connect multiple offices with the least amount of cabling. 
> 
This sets the stage for understanding how we can optimize connections in a network, paving the way for a solution that ensures all nodes are connected with minimal costs.

> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept
> 
> **Purpose**: Explain the core concept or idea that addresses the problem introduced in the motivation callout.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Definition**: Provide a clear, concise definition or explanation of the main concept.
> - **Mechanics**: Describe how the concept works in theoretical or abstract terms.
> - **Relevance**: Tie back to the motivation by explaining how this idea effectively solves the problem.
> 
> **Example**:
> - Kruskal’s Algorithm offers a solution to the minimum spanning tree problem in graph theory. It processes edges of a graph in ascending order of their weights and adds them to the spanning tree, ensuring no cycles are formed, until all vertices are connected. This method efficiently addresses the need for minimal connection costs in networks.

> [!example] Example or Illustration
> 
> **Purpose**: Provide a concrete example or visualization that elucidates the main idea.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Illustrative Example**: Use a specific case, possibly with visual aids or diagrams, to show the idea in action.
> - **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Break down how the example fits or demonstrates the main idea.
> - **Relevance**: Highlight the practical impact or benefits observed in the example.
> 
> **Example**:
> - Consider a network of five nodes where the goal is to connect all nodes with the least total weight. Using Kruskal's Algorithm, we start by selecting the smallest edge, ensuring no cycles are created, and continue until all nodes are interconnected. This process results in a spanning tree with minimized connection costs.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas
> 
> **Purpose**: Expand on the main idea by introducing related concepts, further implications, or advanced considerations.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Broader Implications**: Discuss the broader impact or applications of the main idea.
> - **Related Concepts**: Introduce and explain additional theories or ideas that complement or contrast with the main idea.
> - **Complex Considerations**: Address any complexities or nuances that add depth to the understanding of the main idea.
> 
> **Example**:
> - While implementing Kruskal's Algorithm, consider the union-find data structure for efficient cycle detection. Additionally, explore how variations of the algorithm might behave in directed graphs or with negative weights. These considerations are crucial for adapting the algorithm to more complex or specialized scenarios.

> [!summary] Summary of previous callouts
> 
> **Purpose**: Succinctly explain each of the core ideas  in previous notes using 1 or 2 sentences at most in dot point format. This callout is not necessary in every note. Only use it when I ask you to use it. 
> 
> **Key Elements:**
> - Do not summarise what you wrote. Summarise the content of the notes.
> - Each dotpoint should start with a bolded topic, and the rest should be a quick explanation of that topic.
> 
> **Examples**
> - **DFIR**: Digital forensics and incident response involve identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence while managing the aftermath of cyber-attacks.
> - **Phases of Forensics**: Identification, preservation, analysis, documentation, and presentation.
> - **Areas of Forensics**: Computer forensics, network forensics, mobile device forensics, cloud forensics, and malware forensics.
> - **Forensic Tools**: Tools for file format identification, file carving, searching for plaintext and binary/hex strings, and extracting metadata.
> - **Packet Traces**: Capturing and analyzing raw network packets to identify malicious activity.
> - **Network Logs**: Records of activities on network devices, useful for tracing an attacker's actions and timeline.
> 
> **Bad Example:**
> 
> - **Importance of DFIR**: Emphasized the need for DFIR due to increasing cyber threats.
> - **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**: Explained DFIR, including key phases and areas.
> - **Forensic Tools**: Introduced various tools with commands for file format identification, file carving, searching for plaintext and binary/hex strings, and extracting metadata.
> - **Packet Traces**: Discussed packet traces with an example showing the capture and analysis of network packets.
> - **Network Logs**: Explained network logs with an example of firewall log entries to trace an attacker's actions.

You may also include the following elements in the callouts:

- Tables: Please ensure that tables follow markdown formatting rules.

| Algorithm   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort | O(n^2)          | O(1)             |
| Merge Sort  | O(n log n)      | O(n)             |
| Quick Sort  | O(n log n)      | O(log n)         |

- Images: Indicate where the image should be placed and provide a description so that I can find or create a suitable image (e.g., drawing a graph to illustrate Dijkstra's algorithm in Figma). This is very important. Whenever you want to include an image, You NEED to describe it. Perhaps write the explanation in a codeblock so that I know it can be deleted later.
