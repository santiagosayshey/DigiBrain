# Introduction

Edward Koch believes in a retributive society. He suggests that murder is so morally wrong that it deserves an equally just punishment - state sanctioned killing. He argues that killing murderers is a necessary requirement for public safety. In this essay, I will show why this argument ignores crucial statistical evidence about murder, relies on self contradictory premises, presents a false dichotomy of choice, and ultimately fails to justify its conclusion from both an empirical and logical standpoint. 

Koch's argument requires careful examination. He suggests that the death penalty helps affirm the value of human life rather than diminishing it. It serves as the _only_ adequate response to heinous murder by ensuring justice for victims and preventing murderers from killing again. While Koch makes several claims to support this position, his most substantial reasoning centres on public safety. This argument can be mapped as follows:

- Premise 1: If a convicted murderer will murder again, then we must kill them to prevent murder.
- Premise 2: A convicted murderer will murder again.
- Conclusion: Therefore, we must kill convicted murderers. 

Koch's argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of killing; according to the U.S Department of Justice's studies on violent crime, approximately 90% of murders are committed by first-time offenders, while repeat offenders account for less than 1% of all homicides (*Prescott, Pyle & Starr 2020, p. 1670*). This empirical evidence directly contradicts Koch's first premise, undermining his entire argument. Even if we were to accept his logic that execution is necessary to prevent future murders, implementing the death penalty would, at most, prevent only 1% of future homicides. Furthermore, studies from states with and without capital punishment show no significant difference in murder rates, suggesting that the death penalty fails even as a deterrent (*Death Penalty Information Center 2023*). Koch's argument for public safety through execution collapses under the weight of statistical evidence.

Let us now consider Koch's self contradictory premises to show how absurd his argument really is. When we map his argument to it's analogous form, we get:

- P1: If Y will do X, then we must do X to Y to prevent X
- P2: Y will X
- C: Therefore, we must X to Y

Koch's argument assumes killing is so morally wrong that it justifies killing in response. Let us apply this logical reasoning to an equally reprehensible act: rape. 

- P1: If a rapist will rape again, then we must rape them to prevent rape
- P2: Rapists will rape again
- C: Therefore, we must rape rapists

The argument admits to the moral impermissibility of an action, then justifies the same action as a form of moral retribution. This reveals how Koch's argument contradicts itself: it can't coherently claim that an action is so wrong it justifies doing that exact action as punishment.
