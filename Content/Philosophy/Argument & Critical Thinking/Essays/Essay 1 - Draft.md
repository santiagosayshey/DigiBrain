Edward Koch believes in a retributive society. He suggests that murder is so morally wrong that it deserves an equally just punishment - state sanctioned killing. He argues that killing murderers is a necessary requirement for public safety. In this essay, I will show why this argument relies on self contradictory premises, ignores crucial statistical evidence about murder, presents a false dichotomy of choice, and ultimately fails to justify its conclusion from both a logical and empirical standpoint. 

First, let us consider Koch's argument in more detail. He suggests that the death penalty helps affirm the value of human life rather than diminishing it. It serves as the *only* adequate response to heinous murder by ensuring justice for victims and preventing murderers from killing again. While Koch makes several claims to support this argument, his most substantial reasoning centres on public safety. This can be formalised as the following argument:

- Premise 1: If a convicted murderer will murder again, then we must kill them to prevent murder.
- Premise 2: A convicted murderer will murder again.
- Conclusion: Therefore, we must kill convicted murderers.
