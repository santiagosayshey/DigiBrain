Edward Koch believes in a retributive society. He suggests that murder is so morally wrong that it deserves an equally just punishment - state sanctioned killing. He argues that killing murderers is a necessary requirement for public safety. In this essay, I will show why this argument ignores crucial statistical evidence about murder, relies on self contradictory premises, presents a false dichotomy of choice, and ultimately fails to justify its conclusion from both an empirical and logical standpoint. 

Koch's central argument hinges on a striking paradox: he claims that executing murderers affirms rather than diminishes the value of human life. He presents capital punishment as the _only_ adequate response to murder, arguing it both delivers justice for victims and prevents future killings. While Koch offers several justifications for this position, his argument ultimately rests on a claim about public safety. His reasoning can be mapped as follows:

- Premise 1: If a convicted murderer will murder again, then we must kill them to prevent murder.
- Premise 2: A convicted murderer will murder again.
- Conclusion: Therefore, we must kill convicted murderers. 

Koch's argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of killing; according to the U.S Department of Justice's studies on violent crime, approximately 90% of murders are committed by first-time offenders, while repeat offenders account for less than 1% of all homicides (*Prescott, Pyle & Starr 2020, p. 1670*). This empirical evidence directly contradicts Koch's first premise, undermining his entire argument. Even if we were to accept his logic that execution is necessary to prevent future murders, implementing the death penalty would, at most, prevent only 1% of future homicides. Furthermore, studies from states with and without capital punishment show no significant difference in murder rates, suggesting that the death penalty fails even as a deterrent (*Death Penalty Information Center 2023*). Koch's argument for public safety through execution collapses under the weight of statistical evidence.

Let us now consider Koch's self-contradictory premises. When we map his argument to its analogous form, we get:

- P1: If Y will do X, then we must do X to Y to prevent X
- P2: Y will X
- C: Therefore, we must X to Y

To demonstrate the logical absurdity of this reasoning, we can apply it to another serious crime. Consider how Koch's argument structure would apply to sexual assault:

- P1: If a rapist who has committed sexual assault will do so again, then we must sexually assault them to prevent future assaults
- P2: Such rapists will sexually assault someone again
- C: Therefore, we must sexually assault rapists

The absurdity of this parallel argument reveals the fundamental contradiction in Koch's reasoning. An action cannot be both so morally wrong that it demands an equally just punishment, while also being morally permissible when used as that punishment.

Moreover, Koch's argument presents a false dichotomy; either we execute murderers, or we accept that they will kill again. This oversimplified framing ignores the wide spectrum of preventive and rehabilitative measures available to society. Our approach to other serious crimes demonstrates this point effectively. When addressing sexual assault, for instance, society employs a comprehensive strategy including incarceration, rehabilitation programs, offender registries, and preventive education - none of which require committing the original offence as punishment. Similarly, we can address homicide through multiple evidence-based approaches: improving mental health services, implementing effective gun control measures, strengthening early intervention programs, and providing better education and economic opportunities in high-crime areas. The empirical evidence suggests these preventive measures are far more effective at reducing murder rates than capital punishment. Koch's binary choice between execution and inaction falls apart when confronted with the full range of available solutions.
