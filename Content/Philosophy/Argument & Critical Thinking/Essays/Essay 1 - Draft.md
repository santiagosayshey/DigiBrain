Edward Koch believes in a retributive society. He suggests that murder is so morally wrong that it deserves an equally just punishment - state sanctioned killing. He argues that killing murderers is a necessary requirement for public safety. In this essay, I will show why this argument ignores crucial statistical evidence about murder, relies on self contradictory premises, presents a false dichotomy of choice, and ultimately fails to justify its conclusion from both a logical and empirical standpoint. 

Koch's argument requires careful examination. He suggests that the death penalty helps affirm the value of human life rather than diminishing it. It serves as the _only_ adequate response to heinous murder by ensuring justice for victims and preventing murderers from killing again. While Koch makes several claims to support this position, his most substantial reasoning centers on public safety. This argument can be mapped as follows:

- Premise 1: If a convicted murderer will murder again, then we must kill them to prevent murder.
- Premise 2: A convicted murderer will murder again.
- Conclusion: Therefore, we must kill convicted murderers. 

The claim that we *must* kill murderers to prevent killing from occurring again is demonstrably false. 90% of murders are actually committed by first time murder offenders, while less than 1% are by repeat offenders (). This single counterexample proves that executing convicted murderers cannot provide public safety because the majority of them are happening before one can even intervene. Even if we executed *every* convicted murderer, we would at best prevent only 1% of future murders.
