Edward Koch believes in a retributive society. He suggests that murder is so morally wrong that it deserves an equally just punishment - state sanctioned killing. He argues that killing murderers is a necessary requirement for public safety. In this essay, I will show why this argument ignores crucial statistical evidence about murder, relies on self contradictory premises, presents a false dichotomy of choice, and ultimately fails to justify its conclusion from both an empirical and logical standpoint. 

Koch's claims that executing murderers affirms rather than diminishes the value of human life. He presents the death penalty as the _only_ adequate response to murder, arguing it both delivers justice for victims and prevents future killings. While Koch offers several justifications for this position, his argument ultimately rests on a claim about public safety. His reasoning can be mapped as follows:

- Premise 1: If a convicted murderer will murder again, then we must kill them to prevent murder.
- Premise 2: A convicted murderer will murder again.
- Conclusion: Therefore, we must kill convicted murderers. 

Koch's argument fundamentally misunderstands the pattern nature of homicides; according to the U.S Department of Justice's studies on violent crime, approximately 90% of murders are committed by first-time murderers, while repeat offenders account for less than 1% of all homicides (*Prescott, Pyle & Starr 2020, p. 1670*). This empirical evidence directly contradicts Koch's first premise, undermining his entire argument. Even if we were to accept his logic that execution is necessary to prevent future murders, implementing the death penalty would, at most, prevent only 1% of future homicides. Furthermore, studies from states with and without capital punishment show no significant difference in murder rates, suggesting that the death penalty fails even as a deterrent (*Death Penalty Information Center 2023*). Koch's argument for public safety through execution collapses under the weight of statistical evidence.

This evidence exposes Koch's empirical errors, but his argument suffers from an even deeper logical contradiction. When we map his argument to its analogous form, we get:

- P1: If Y will do X, then we must do X to Y to prevent X
- P2: Y will X
- C: Therefore, we must X to Y

To demonstrate the logical absurdity of this reasoning, we can apply it to another serious crime. Consider how Koch's argument structure would apply to sexual assault:

- P1: If a rapist who has committed sexual assault will do so again, then we must sexually assault them to prevent future assaults
- P2: Such rapists will sexually assault someone again
- C: Therefore, we must sexually assault rapists

The absurdity of this parallel argument reveals the fundamental contradiction in Koch's reasoning. An action cannot be both so morally wrong that it demands an equally just punishment, while also being morally permissible when used as that punishment.

Even if we set aside the statistical and logical failures, Koch's argument collapses into a false dichotomy; either we execute murderers, or we accept that they will kill again. Society's approach to other serious crimes demonstrates why this is overly simplistic. When addressing sexual assault, society employs comprehensive strategies including incarceration, rehabilitation, and preventive education - none of which require committing the original offence as punishment. Similarly, we can address homicide through evidence-based approaches like mental health services and effective gun control measures. These preventive measures have proven far more effective at reducing murder rates than capital punishment, revealing how Koch's binary choice between execution and inaction ignores viable alternatives.

# Conclusion

Koch's argument for the death penalty fails on multiple levels: it ignores empirical evidence about murder rates, relies on self-contradictory logic, and presents a false dichotomy between execution and inaction. His vision of a retributive society ultimately devolves into an emotional appeal for vengeance, rather than offering evidence-based solutions that could actually prevent murder and protect human life.
