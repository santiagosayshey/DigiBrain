- likely want to argue 'against' Koch here. I'm inclined to take a stance against the death penalty, so I feel my writing will be better if i write from a perspective i share and so happen to align with (criticising his argument)

Koch argues that the death penalty is morally justified and necessary because it affirms the highest value of human life by imposing the ultimate consequence for taking it, ensures justice in cases where lesser punishments would be inadequate, and serves as the only absolute guarantee that murderers cannot kill again.
