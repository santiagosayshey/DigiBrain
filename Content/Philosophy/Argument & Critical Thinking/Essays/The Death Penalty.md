# Notes
- likely want to argue 'against' Koch here. I'm inclined to take a stance against the death penalty, so I feel my writing will be better if i write from a perspective i share and so happen to align with (criticising his argument)

Koch argues that the death penalty helps affirm the value of human life rather than diminishing it, serving as the only adequate response to heinous murder by ensuring justice for victims and preventing murderers from killing again.

Koch's most powerful(?) reasoning for this is the public safety argument. It can be mapped as follows:

- P1: Murderers will kill again, both in prison and after release
- P2: Only the death penalty guarantees a murderer will never kill again
- C: The death penalty is necessary to protect innocent people

disproving data
- data that says that 90% of murders in the US happen from a first time murdered (ie, there was no oppurtunity to sentence them to the death penalty because they had not murdered before).
- the numbers get increasingly lower for repeat offenders, roughly 1% of all murders occur from these people after either having served any amount of time or even while still incarcerated.


logical form
- P1: X will cause Y
- P2: Z
