# Notes
- likely want to argue 'against' Koch here. I'm inclined to take a stance against the death penalty, so I feel my writing will be better if i write from a perspective i share and so happen to align with (criticising his argument)


p1: killing people is wrong
p2: people who do wrong things deserve to be punished
p3: the death penalty is a suitable punishment
c: we should subject murderers to the death penalty

using analogy, we get:

p1: raping people is wrong
p2: people do wrong things deserve to be punished
p3: a hypothetical rape penalty is a suitable punishment (????)
c: we should sodomise
