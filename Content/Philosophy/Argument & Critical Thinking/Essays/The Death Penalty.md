- likely want to argue 'against' Koch here. I'm inclined to take a stance against the death penalty, so I feel my writing will be better if i write from a perspective i share and so happen to align with (criticising his argument)


- killing people is wrong
- 
- the death penalty exists as the ultimate affirmation of life
