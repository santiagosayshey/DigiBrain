**Page 1 - What the author is discussing:**
The author defines the Bermuda Triangle as a region in the western Atlantic bounded by Bermuda, southern Florida, and Puerto Rico (extending to 40Â° west longitude). They claim over 100 planes and ships have vanished since 1945, with 1000+ lives lost in 26 years, no bodies or wreckage ever found, and disappearances increasing despite better technology and record-keeping.

**Analysis:**
- **Affect heuristic/framing** - "disturbing and almost unbelievable," "literally vanished into thin air," "world's catalogue of unexplained mysteries" - emotional language triggers fear/mystery before presenting evidence
- **Base rate neglect setup** - 100+ disappearances given without context (total traffic volume? comparison to other ocean regions?)
- **Alternative hypotheses not considered** - better record-keeping could mean more documented (not actual) disappearances; high-traffic area might have proportionally normal accident rates; selection bias in defining triangle boundaries


**Page 2 - What the author is discussing:**
The author describes various disappearances in detail. They claim planes vanished while in normal radio contact, with some reporting strange phenomena: non-functioning instruments, spinning compasses, yellow/hazy sky on clear days, and ocean "not looking right." They cite Flight 19 (five Navy TBM Avengers) from December 5, 1945, plus the rescue plane sent after them, as subjects of intensive searches that found no wreckage. They mention large ships (Marine Sulphur Queen, USS Cyclops with 309 people) vanishing completely, while other vessels were found drifting with only animals surviving. The author states this continues today, with the Coast Guard classifying cases as "search discontinued" while the public feels there's a connection between past and present incidents.

**Analysis:**

- **Cherry-picking/Confirmation bias** - Selects dramatic cases (Flight 19, USS Cyclops) while mentioning but dismissing found vessels with survivors
- **Representativeness heuristic** - "snatched into another dimension," "flown through a hole in the sky" - makes events seem to fit a supernatural pattern
- **Affect heuristic continues** - "extraordinary messages," emphasizing crew silence, surviving animals but not humans - all amplify mystery
- **False dichotomy setup** - Either ships vanish completely OR are found with animal survivors, ignoring normal maritime accidents
- **Ignoring alternative explanations** - Instrument malfunction, weather disorientation, communication failure are mentioned but not explored as causes
