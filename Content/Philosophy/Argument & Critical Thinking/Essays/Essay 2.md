**Page 1 - What the author is discussing:**

The author defines the Bermuda Triangle as a region in the western Atlantic bounded by Bermuda, southern Florida, and Puerto Rico (extending to 40Â° west longitude). They claim over 100 planes and ships have vanished since 1945, with 1000+ lives lost in 26 years, no bodies or wreckage ever found, and disappearances increasing despite better technology and record-keeping.

**Analysis:**

- **Affect heuristic/framing** - "disturbing and almost unbelievable," "literally vanished into thin air," "world's catalogue of unexplained mysteries" - emotional language triggers fear/mystery before presenting evidence
- **Base rate neglect setup** - 100+ disappearances given without context (total traffic volume? comparison to other ocean regions?)
- **Alternative hypotheses not considered** - better record-keeping could mean more documented (not actual) disappearances; high-traffic area might have proportionally normal accident rates; selection bias in defining triangle boundaries
