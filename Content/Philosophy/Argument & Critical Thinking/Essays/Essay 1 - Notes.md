# Notes
- likely want to argue 'against' Koch here. I'm inclined to take a stance against the death penalty, so I feel my writing will be better if i write from a perspective i share and so happen to align with (criticising his argument)

Koch argues that the death penalty helps affirm the value of human life rather than diminishing it, serving as the only adequate response to heinous murder by ensuring justice for victims and preventing murderers from killing again.

Koch's most powerful(?) reasoning for this is the public safety argument. It can be mapped as follows:

- P1: Some murderers will kill again, both in prison and after release
- P2: The death penalty guarantees a murderer will never kill again
- C: The death penalty is necessary to protect innocent people from murderers

disproving data
- data that says that 90% of murders in the US happen from a first time murdered (ie, there was no oppurtunity to sentence them to the death penalty because they had not murdered before).
- the numbers get increasingly lower for repeat offenders, roughly 1% of all murders occur from these people after either having served any amount of time or even while still incarcerated.

logical form
- P1: Some people will do harmful act X
- P2: Doing X to them first prevents them from doing X
- C: Therefore, we should do X to prevent X

analogy:
- P1: Some people will rape other people
- P2: Raping rapists prevents them from raping again
- C: Therefore, we should rape people to prevent rape

even closer:
- P1: Some people will kill other people (which by the data, is most murders, not just repeat offdenders)
- P2: Killing people prevents them from killing in the first place
- C: Therefore we should klill people to prevent people killing

# More Formal Notes

Koch argues that the death penalty helps affirm the value of human life rather than diminishing it, serving as the only adequate response to heinous murder by ensuring justice for victims and preventing murderers from killing again.

Koch's most powerful reasoning centers on the public safety argument. It can be mapped as follows:

Original Argument:
- P1: If a convicted murderer will murder again, then we must kill them to prevent murder
- P2: A convicted murderer will murder again
- C: Therefore, we must kill convicted murderers

Mapped Logically:
- P1: If Y will do X, then we must do X to Y to prevent X
- P2: Y will X
- C: Therefore, we must X to Y

Rape Analogy:
- P1: If a rapist will rape again, then we must rape them to prevent rape
- P2: Rapists will rape again
- C: Therefore, we must rape rapists

The rape analogy not only shows the absurdity of Koch's logic but exposes a crucial hidden premise:

Koch's argument assumes killing is so morally wrong that it justifies killing in response. When we apply this same moral reasoning to rape:

- If rape is so morally wrong that it justifies the most extreme response...
- And we use rape itself as that response...
- Then we're admitting rape is simultaneously morally wrong AND morally justified

This reveals how Koch's argument contradicts itself: it can't coherently claim that an action is so wrong it justifies doing that exact action as punishment.

Counter Argument: 
- Koch claims the death penalty is necessary to prevent murders by executing convicted murderers. However, this claim is demonstrably false: 90% of murders are committed by first-time offenders, while only 1% are by repeat offenders. This single counterexample proves that executing convicted murderers cannot prevent the majority of murders, since they haven't killed before. Even if we executed every convicted murderer, we would at best prevent only 1% of future murders, while being powerless to prevent the other 90%. Furthermore, Koch presents a false choice between execution and allowing murders to occur, ignoring proven alternatives like life imprisonment, maximum security facilities, and rehabilitation programs. His argument not only fails to address the main source of murders (first-time offenders) but also falsely suggests execution is the only way to prevent the small percentage of repeat offenses.
