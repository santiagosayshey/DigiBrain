Dear Dr. Opie,

I hope you're doing well. After reviewing my first quiz results, I feel some questions were marked a bit unfairly and would appreciate if they could be reviewed.

Regarding question 7 about "matters of perspective," I received partial credit (0.5/1). My understanding of the concept is that: 
- "Mars is the most interesting planet orbiting the sun" is a matter of perspective because what makes a planet "interesting" is subjective and varies from person to person 
- "Elon Musk thinks Mars is the most interesting planet" is not a matter of perspective but a claim about someone's belief that can be factually verified 
- The statements about planet counts, Mars's proximity, and Jupiter's position are all objective facts that can be verified through measurement, not matters of perspective

For question 8, my definition for "uncritical thinking" was marked as missing, but I did include this definition in my response.

For question 9 on the helicopter parenting passage, I identified the same conclusion as the model answer. However, I felt I approached it by mapping out the argument's logical structure more thoroughly:

- I identified the specific premises about helicopter parents' supervision and its negative outcomes
- I recognised how these premises support a sub-conclusion about helicopter parenting being a barrier to independence
- I noted how the parents' preference for doing things themselves (premise 4) ironically works against their goals as another premise
- I arrived at the main conclusion that "if parents stopped helicopter parenting, their children would develop the skills that they are concerned about in the first place"

I felt my presentation mapped the argument structure more thoroughly - the substance of my analysis identified the same conclusion and supporting reasoning. It seems quite unfair to have lost 3/4 of the marks for taking this approach. 

Thank you for considering these points.

Cheers,
Samuel Chau
