> [!motivation] Faulty Reasoning
>
> While formal argumentation involves structured steps like presenting premises and evaluating soundness or validity, **everyday communication rarely adheres to such strict formats.** In real-world discussions, arguments are often presented imperfectly, and the reasoning employed can be flawed.
> - The challenge lies in **recognizing these errors in reasoning,** both in others' arguments and our own.
> - Understanding how to identify these common pitfalls is crucial for critical thinking and **avoiding being misled by defective arguments.**

> [!idea] Fallacies
>
> Faulty reasoning often manifests as "fallacies," which are **errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument.** Unlike sound deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning where the truth of premises generally supports the truth of the conclusion, fallacies lead to invalid or unsound conclusions even if the premises seem plausible.
>
> Fallacies can be broadly categorized:
> - **Formal Fallacies**: These are errors in the logical structure or form of an argument. The argument is invalid because of how it is constructed, regardless of the truth or falsity of its content. If the form is flawed, any argument using that form is a formal fallacy.
>     - *Example Idea*: A flawed blueprint for a house (the structure) will result in an unstable house, no matter how good the building materials (the content) are.
> - **Informal Fallacies**: These are errors related to the content, context, or delivery of an argument, rather than its logical structure. The argument's structure might appear valid, but the reasoning is flawed due to issues like irrelevant information, ambiguity, assumptions, or emotional appeals.
>     - *Example Idea*: An argument might have a correct logical form, but if it's based on incorrect facts, misleading language, or aims to distract, it becomes an informal fallacy. The same logical structure with different, accurate content might not be fallacious.
>
> The key distinction is that formal fallacies are about the *invalidity of the argument's form*, while informal fallacies are about *unsoundness arising from the argument's content or context*.

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: Affirming the Consequent
>
> Affirming the consequent is a formal fallacy that occurs when one incorrectly assumes that if the consequent (the "then" part) of a conditional statement is true, then the antecedent (the "if" part) must also be true. This fallacy confuses necessary and sufficient conditions.
>
> - **Logical Form:**
>   1. If P, then Q.
>   2. Q is true.
>   3. Therefore, P is true. (Fallacious inference)
>
> - **Explanation of Error:** In a statement "If P, then Q," P is a **sufficient condition** for Q (P being true is enough to guarantee Q is true). Q is a **necessary condition** for P (if P is true, then Q *must* be true). However, Q being true does not make Q a sufficient condition to conclude P. The fallacy arises from treating Q as if it were a sufficient condition for P, ignoring that other conditions (besides P) might also lead to Q.
>
> - **Example:**
>   - **Premise 1:** If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).
>     - *Here, raining (P) is a sufficient condition for the ground being wet (Q). The ground being wet (Q) is a necessary condition if it is indeed raining (P).*
>   - **Premise 2:** The ground is wet (Q is true).
>   - **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, it is raining (P is true).
>
>   This is fallacious because while rain is sufficient to make the ground wet, the ground being wet is not sufficient to conclude it's raining. Other causes (e.g., sprinklers, a spilled bucket of water) could make the ground wet. The argument incorrectly infers the specific sufficient condition (P) from the observation of a necessary condition (Q).

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: Denying the Antecedent
>
> Denying the antecedent is a formal fallacy where one incorrectly concludes that if the antecedent (the "if" part) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the "then" part) must also be false. This fallacy also stems from a misunderstanding of necessary and sufficient conditions.
>
> - **Logical Form:**
>   1. If P, then Q.
>   2. P is false (Not P).
>   3. Therefore, Q is false (Therefore, Not Q). (Fallacious inference)
>
> - **Explanation of Error:**
>   In the statement "If P, then Q," P is a **sufficient condition** for Q (P's truth guarantees Q's truth). However, P is not necessarily a **necessary condition** for Q (Q could still be true even if P is false, due to other factors).
>   The fallacy occurs by incorrectly assuming that because the specific sufficient condition P is not met, Q cannot occur. It overlooks other potential sufficient conditions for Q.
>
> - **Example:**
>   - **Premise 1:** If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).
>     - *Raining (P) is a sufficient condition for the ground being wet (Q).*
>   - **Premise 2:** It is not raining (P is false).
>   - **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, the ground is not wet (Q is false).
>
>   This is fallacious because the ground could still be wet for other reasons even if it's not raining (e.g., sprinklers were on, someone spilled water). Denying the specific antecedent (rain) doesn't negate the consequent (wet ground) if other causes exist.

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: The Undistributed Middle
>
> The fallacy of the undistributed middle is a formal error that occurs in categorical syllogisms. A categorical syllogism has two premises and a conclusion, and involves three terms, each appearing twice. The "middle term" is the one that appears in both premises but not in the conclusion. For the syllogism to be valid, this middle term must be "distributed" in at least one premise, meaning the premise makes a claim about all members of the class designated by that term.
>
> - **Problem Structure:**
>   1. All A are B. (Major premise)
>   2. All C are B. (Minor premise)
>   3. Therefore, all A are C. (Fallacious conclusion)
>   Here, 'B' is the middle term. In both premises, 'B' is the predicate and is undistributed. We know something about things that are A (they are B) and things that are C (they are also B), but we don't know if the set of A's and the set of C's have any necessary overlap just because they both share the property of being B.
>
> - **Explanation of Error:**
>   The middle term fails to connect the major term (A) and the minor term (C) because neither premise tells us anything about *all* members of the class B. Both A and C share a property B, but this doesn't mean A and C are related to each other. It's like saying two people live in the same city (middle term), therefore they must live in the same house (fallacious connection).
>
> - **Example:**
>   - **Premise 1:** All dogs (A) are mammals (B).
>     - *(The middle term "mammals" (B) is undistributed here; this premise tells us something about all dogs, but not all mammals.)*
>   - **Premise 2:** All cats (C) are mammals (B).
>     - *(The middle term "mammals" (B) is also undistributed here; this premise tells us something about all cats, but not all mammals.)*
>   - **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, all dogs (A) are cats (C).
>
>   The conclusion is clearly false. Both dogs and cats belong to the larger class of mammals, but this shared characteristic doesn't mean they are the same thing or that one is a subset of the other in the way the conclusion claims. The middle term "mammals" doesn't adequately link "dogs" and "cats" because it's not distributed in either premise.

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: Base Rate Neglect
>
> Base Rate Neglect is a fallacy where individuals tend to ignore general statistical information (the "base rate") about the prevalence of an event or characteristic, focusing instead on specific, vivid, or individuating information, even if that specific information is less reliable or relevant for making a judgment. While often considered a cognitive bias, it leads to formally incorrect probabilistic reasoning when base rates are crucial for accurate conclusions.
>
> - **How it Works:**
>   People often overweight specific evidence (e.g., a description of a person) and underweight or ignore the prior probability or underlying frequency (the base rate) of an outcome or category.
>
> - **Explanation of Error:**
>   The error lies in failing to properly incorporate the background frequency of an event when assessing the likelihood of a specific case. Sound statistical reasoning, such as Bayesian inference, requires considering both the specific evidence and the prior probabilities (base rates). Ignoring the base rate leads to skewed judgments about probability.
>
> - **Example:**
>   Imagine a city has 1 million inhabitants.
>   - **Base Rate Information:**
>     - There are 100 known spies in the city (0.01% of the population).
>     - There are 999,900 non-spies (99.99% of the population).
>   - **Specific, but Imperfect, Test:**
>     - A new spy detection system correctly identifies a spy 99% of the time (true positive).
>     - The system incorrectly identifies a non-spy as a spy 1% of the time (false positive).
>
>   Suppose someone triggers the alarm. What is the probability they are actually a spy?
>
>   - **Fallacious Reasoning (Neglecting Base Rate):** Many might intuitively think the probability is very high, perhaps around 99%, focusing only on the test's accuracy for identifying spies.
>
>   - **Correct Reasoning (Incorporating Base Rate):**
>     - Expected true positives (actual spies correctly identified): $100 \text{ spies} \times 0.99 = 99 \text{ spies}$
>     - Expected false positives (non-spies incorrectly identified): $999,900 \text{ non-spies} \times 0.01 = 9,999 \text{ non-spies}$
>     - Total people identified as spies: $99 + 9,999 = 10,098$
>     - Probability that a person identified as a spy is actually a spy: $\frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Total Identified}} = \frac{99}{10098} \approx 0.0098 \text{ or } 0.98\%$
>
>   By neglecting the very low base rate of spies, one would drastically overestimate the probability that a positive test result indicates an actual spy. The specific information (the positive test) is important, but it must be weighed against the general information (the rarity of spies).
