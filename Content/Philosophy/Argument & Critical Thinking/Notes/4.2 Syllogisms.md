> [!motivation] From One Premise to Two
> 
> In logic, we've examined one-premise arguments that establish relationships between two classes. For example, "All humans are mortal" relates the classes of humans and mortals.
> 
> However, more complex reasoning often requires connecting multiple relationships to draw conclusions about classes that aren't directly compared in any single premise.
> 
> This introduces the question: **How can we systematically connect multiple premises to derive valid conclusions about indirectly related classes?**

> [!idea] Syllogisms
> 
> A syllogism is a deductive argument consisting of **two premises and a conclusion, involving exactly three terms** (classes).
> 
> **Structure:**
> 
> - Major premise: Relates the major term (P) to the middle term (M)
> - Minor premise: Relates the minor term (S) to the middle term (M)
> - Conclusion: Relates the minor term (S) to the major term (P)
> 
> **The middle term (M) appears in both premises but not in the conclusion, serving as the connecting link between the other terms.**
> 

> [!example] Standard Syllogism with Venn Diagram Explanation
> 
> **Major premise:** All Gorillas (G) are Primates (P)
> - This shades all regions of G that are outside of P (meaning no gorillas exist outside the primates circle)

> 
> **Minor premise:** All Primates (P) are Mammals (M)
> - This shades all regions of P that are outside of M (meaning no primates exist outside the mammals circle)
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20250327000258.png|500]]
> 
> **Conclusion:** Therefore, all Gorillas (G) are Mammals (M)
> 
> **Why the Venn diagram confirms validity:**
> 
> - When we combine both premises, we've shaded all regions of G that are outside of P, and all regions of P that are outside of M
> - This means that any part of G must be inside P, and any part of P must be inside M
> - Therefore, any part of G must necessarily be inside M (since G is contained within P, which is contained within M)
> - This establishes that "All Gorillas are Mammals" must be true if the premises are true
> 
> The validity doesn't depend on any elements actually existing in G - it only establishes that IF any gorillas exist, they MUST be mammals because they must be primates (premise 1) and all primates must be mammals (premise 2).

> [!consider] Validity vs. Soundness
> 
> **Validity** concerns the logical structure of a syllogism:
> 
> - A syllogism is valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises
> - Validity depends only on the form, not the content
> 
> **Soundness** requires both:
> 
> - The syllogism must be valid (correct form)
> - All premises must be true
> 
> **Invalid Syllogism Forms:**
> 
> - Fallacy of the undistributed middle: When the middle term isn't universal in at least one premise Example: "All dogs are animals. All cats are animals. Therefore, all dogs are cats."
>     
> - Illicit major/minor: When a term is distributed in the conclusion but not in its premise Example: "All cats are mammals. No dogs are cats. Therefore, no dogs are mammals."
