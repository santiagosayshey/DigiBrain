> [!motivation] From One Premise to Two
> 
> In logic, we've examined one-premise arguments that establish relationships between two classes. For example, "All humans are mortal" relates the classes of humans and mortals.
> 
> However, more complex reasoning often requires connecting multiple relationships to draw conclusions about classes that aren't directly compared in any single premise.
> 
> This introduces the question: **How can we systematically connect multiple premises to derive valid conclusions about indirectly related classes?**

> [!idea] Syllogisms
> 
> A syllogism is a deductive argument consisting of two premises and a conclusion, involving exactly three terms (classes).
> 
> **Structure:**
> 
> - Major premise: Relates the major term (P) to the middle term (M)
> - Minor premise: Relates the minor term (S) to the middle term (M)
> - Conclusion: Relates the minor term (S) to the major term (P)
> 
> The middle term (M) appears in both premises but not in the conclusion, serving as the connecting link between the other terms.
> 
> **Categorical Statements in Syllogisms:**
> 
> |Type|Form|Name|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|All S are P|Universal Affirmative|All humans are mortal|
> |E|No S are P|Universal Negative|No cats are dogs|
> |I|Some S are P|Particular Affirmative|Some birds are black|
> |O|Some S are not P|Particular Negative|Some students are not seniors|

> [!example] Standard Syllogism
> 
> **Major premise:** All mammals are animals (All M are P) **Minor premise:** All dogs are mammals (All S are M) **Conclusion:** Therefore, all dogs are animals (All S are P)
> 
> This syllogism works because:
> 
> - The middle term "mammals" connects dogs and animals
> - The relationship between each pair is clearly established
> - The conclusion follows necessarily from the premises
> 
> We can visualize this using Euler circles:
> 
> ```image_goes_here
> Three nested circles: Largest circle labeled "Animals (P)", middle circle labeled "Mammals (M)", innermost circle labeled "Dogs (S)"
> ```

> [!consider] Validity vs. Soundness
> 
> **Validity** concerns the logical structure of a syllogism:
> 
> - A syllogism is valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises
> - Validity depends only on the form, not the content
> 
> **Soundness** requires both:
> 
> - The syllogism must be valid (correct form)
> - All premises must be true
> 
> **Invalid Syllogism Forms:**
> 
> - Fallacy of the undistributed middle: When the middle term isn't universal in at least one premise Example: "All dogs are animals. All cats are animals. Therefore, all dogs are cats."
>     
> - Illicit major/minor: When a term is distributed in the conclusion but not in its premise Example: "All cats are mammals. No dogs are cats. Therefore, no dogs are mammals."
