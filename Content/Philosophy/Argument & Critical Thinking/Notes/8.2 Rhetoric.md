## 1. Objective: Create Clear, Modular Notes

Hello! Let's create some notes on the topic specified below.

- **Topic for Notes:** `[INSERT NOTES TOPIC HERE]`

I need these notes to be:

- **Concise & Modular:** Easy to digest in distinct blocks.
- **Focused on Key Ideas:** Highlight the core concepts for understanding.
- **Synthesized:** Please process and explain the information, not just copy text from sources.
- **Formatted with Callouts:** Structure the entire output using the 'callout' blocks defined below.

**Do not** provide a preliminary outline or introduction. Generate the final formatted note directly.

## 2. Callout Formatting Guide

Structure the notes using 'callout' blocks. Each block starts with `>` on every line, with the first line defining the type and title:

Markdown

```
> [!callout_type] Title of Callout
>
> Content for the callout goes here.
> - Bullet points can be used for lists.
> Further explanations or details.
```

- **Titles:** Keep titles informative and brief (e.g., `Kruskal's Algorithm`, `Network Cost Problem`). Avoid generic placeholders like `Main Idea Here`.
- **Content:** Tailor the content within each callout based on its defined purpose (see section 3).

## 3. Callout Type Definitions

Here are the available callout types. Use them as appropriate for the content. The descriptions clarify the intended _purpose_ of each type:

### `> [!motivation] Motivation`

- **Purpose**: Sets the context. Introduce the problem, need, or scenario that the main topic addresses. _Do not include the solution itself here._
- **Elements**: Describe the challenge or situation; outline the specific issues needing resolution.
- **Example (MST Context)**: Minimizing cost (like cable length) when connecting multiple points in a network, while ensuring full connectivity, presents a common optimization challenge.

### `> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept`

- **Purpose**: Explains the core solution, definition, or algorithm.
- **Elements**: Clearly define the concept; describe how it works; link it back to solving the problem stated in the motivation.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Kruskal's Algorithm identifies a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in weighted, undirected graphs. It greedily adds the lowest-weight edge available that doesn't create a cycle, continuing until all vertices are connected.

### `> [!example] Example or Illustration`

- **Purpose**: Provides a concrete demonstration of the idea in action.
- **Elements**: Show a specific case, walk through steps, use diagrams (described), or illustrate the outcome. Explain _how_ the example demonstrates the concept.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Given a graph, Kruskal's first sorts edges by weight. It then adds edges like AB (weight 1), CD (weight 2), AC (weight 3), skipping edges like BD (weight 4) if adding it would form a cycle, until an MST is formed.

### `> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas`

- **Purpose**: Adds depth by exploring related topics, nuances, limitations, or advanced aspects.
- **Elements**: Discuss broader implications, related theories, implementation details (like data structures), edge cases, or variations.
- **Example (Kruskal's Algorithm)**: Cycle detection in Kruskal's is often efficiently handled by a Union-Find data structure. The algorithm's time complexity is typically influenced by edge sorting and Union-Find operations (O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)). Consider Prim's algorithm as an alternative MST approach.

### `> [!summary] Summary of Key Concepts`

- **Purpose**: Briefly recap main points from previous callouts. **Only use when specifically requested.**
- **Format**: Use bullet points. Start each point with the **bolded topic** followed by a 1-2 sentence summary. Focus on _what_ the concepts are.
- **Good Example**:
    - **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: A subset of edges connecting all vertices in a graph with the minimum possible total weight without cycles.
    - **Greedy Algorithm**: An approach that makes the locally optimal choice at each step; Kruskal's is an example.
- **Avoid**: Summarizing the structure of the notes themselves (e.g., "We discussed the motivation, then the idea...").

## 4. Allowed Formatting Within Callouts

You can enhance callouts with:

- **Tables**: Use standard Markdown.
```markdown
| Algorithm | Complexity | Notes           |
| :-------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| Kruskal's | O(E log E) | Requires sorting |
| Prim's    | O(E log V) | Using Fibonacci heap |
```
    
- **Images**: Mark placement with a placeholder block. **Provide a clear description** of the desired image and use the Obsidian wikilink format `![[ImageName.png]]`.
```image-goes-here
Description: Diagram comparing the edge selection process of Kruskal's vs Prim's algorithm on the same sample graph. Kruskal's focuses on global lowest edge, Prim's grows from a starting node.
![[kruskal_vs_prim_comparison.png]]
```

- **Math**: Use LaTeX delimiters.
    - Inline: `$O(N^2)$`
    - Block:
```math
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi
$$
```
        
## 5. Specific Callout Sequence Interpretation

Check the table below. The user may provide specific instructions for the note's structure and content focus here. Your action depends on the state of this table in the user's request:

- **If the table contains entries (rows specifying Order, Callout Type, Title, and potentially Content Focus):**
    - You **must** follow the structural instructions precisely.
    - Generate the note using the exact sequence, `[!callout type]`, and `Title` provided in each row.
    - Do **not** add, remove, or reorder the callouts relative to the specified sequence.
    - It is imperative that you write **ONLY** the provided callouts and nothing more or less. 
	    - This means if it only has 1 row, then you write a callout for that 1 row. It is vital that you understand this and do not try to generate more than what is asked. 
    - Consult the **Content Focus / Notes** column for each row. If notes are provided, use them as **guidance** regarding the _information_, _key points_, or _emphasis_ the user wants within that specific callout.
    - **Important Constraint:** These notes are **high-level pointers**, _not_ prescriptive text or rigid formatting rules. They should inform the _content_ you generate but **must not dictate** your specific wording, sentence structure, or the overall objective writing style required by this prompt. Think of them as hints for _what_ to cover or emphasize, allowing you to still synthesize and formulate the explanation clearly and objectively.
    - Ensure the final content generated for each callout aligns with its specified `[!callout type]` and `Title`, while incorporating the thematic guidance from the notes column where provided and applicable.
- **If the table is empty or absent:**
    - You have the flexibility to determine the most effective sequence, types of callouts (e.g., `[!motivation]`, `[!idea]`, `[!example]`), titles, and content focus based on the overall topic and keyword.

_(The table structure below illustrates the format the user employs. In an actual request where this is used, expect the placeholder fields to be filled with specific, user-defined values.)_

i have already writen some callouts, which you can see below. please do not repeat them back to me, only write was is asked for. 


> [!idea] Rhetoric
>
> Rhetoric refers to the art of effective or persuasive speaking and writing, encompassing techniques that extend beyond pure logical reasoning. Dating back to ancient Greece, rhetoric represents the systematic study of persuasive communication.
>
> **The Classical Rhetorical Appeals**:
>
> - **Ethos** (Ethical Appeal)
>   - Appeals based on the speaker's credibility, character, and trustworthiness
>   - Builds audience confidence through demonstrated expertise, honesty, and shared values
>   - Examples: Professional credentials, reputation, moral consistency, personal experience
>
> - **Logos** (Logical Appeal)
>   - Appeals based on reasoning, evidence, and logical argument structure
>   - Persuades through facts, statistics, case studies, and sound argument progression
>   - Represents the most rational component of rhetoric, closest to pure reasoning
>
> - **Pathos** (Emotional Appeal)
>   - Appeals targeting audience emotions and values (as detailed in the previous callout)
>   - Creates psychological states that make audiences more receptive to messages
>   - Often the most immediately powerful but potentially manipulative element
>
> **Ethical Considerations**:
> - Rhetoric itself is morally neutral—a set of tools and techniques for persuasion
> - Ethical rhetoric maintains a balance between all three appeals rather than overrelying on emotion
> - Problematic rhetoric often features imbalance: heavy pathos with minimal logos, manufactured ethos
> - The responsibility lies with both communicators (to use rhetoric ethically) and audiences (to recognize rhetorical techniques)
>
> Recognizing these rhetorical approaches helps us identify when persuasion moves beyond pure reasoning—allowing us to evaluate both the logical merits and the persuasive techniques being employed.

> [!example] Donald Trump's Rhetoric
>
> Donald Trump's communication style demonstrates distinctive rhetorical patterns that have proven highly effective with his target audience. His approach shows a consistent emphasis on certain rhetorical techniques across different contexts.
>
> **Key Rhetorical Characteristics**:
> - Simple, direct language with repetition
> - Strong emotional appeals (particularly fear and pride)
> - Establishment of personal authority through claimed expertise
> - Creation of clear in-groups and out-groups
>
> **Analysis of Trump's Rhetorical Techniques**:
>
> | Statement/Approach | Appeal Type | Rhetorical Technique | Intended Effect |
> |-------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
> | "I alone can fix it." | Ethos | Self-aggrandizement | Establishes personal authority without institutional credibility |
> | "We're going to win so much you'll get tired of winning." | Pathos | Hyperbole & collective language | Creates shared emotional anticipation and group identity |
> | "The election was stolen from us." | Pathos & Ethos | Assertion without evidence | Generates outrage and positions speaker as truth-teller |
> | "America is no longer respected around the world." | Pathos | Appeal to national pride/shame | Triggers emotional response about collective status |
> | "I've built a tremendous company. I know more about..." | Ethos | Claimed expertise | Transfers business credibility to political/policy domains |
> | "These are the worst trade deals ever negotiated." | Logos (weak) | Superlative without comparison | Creates impression of factual assessment while avoiding specifics |
> | "Many people are saying..." | Ethos | Anonymous authority | Suggests widespread agreement without verifiable sources |
> | Use of nicknames ("Crooked Hillary," "Sleepy Joe") | Pathos | Ad hominem | Replaces policy critique with emotional characterization |
>
> **Rhetorical Effectiveness Factors**:
> - Consistency of messaging across platforms
> - Emotional resonance with existing audience concerns
> - Simple language that increases message retention
> - Clear contrast between problems and promised solutions
> - Strategic ambiguity that allows audience projection
>
> This analysis demonstrates how effective rhetoric can prioritize emotional and character appeals (pathos and ethos) while minimizing detailed logical argumentation (logos), particularly when targeting audiences receptive to these approaches.

> [!idea] Register
>
> Linguistic register refers to the variety of language we select based on social context and audience. It fundamentally shapes how persuasive messages are received before content is even evaluated.
>
> **Core Dimensions of Register:**
> - **Formality:** The level of ceremonial language and adherence to linguistic conventions
> - **Technicality:** The degree of specialized vocabulary and conceptual complexity
> - **Emotionality:** How explicitly feelings are expressed or invoked
> - **Directness:** Whether meanings are stated explicitly or implied
>
> Register typically falls along this spectrum:
>
> | Register Type | Characteristics | Example Contexts |
> |--------------|-----------------|------------------|
> | Frozen | Unchanging, ritualized | Legal documents, religious ceremonies |
> | Formal | Structured, impersonal | Academic writing, business reports |
> | Consultative | Professional but interactive | Classroom teaching, workplace meetings |
> | Casual | Relaxed, colloquial | Social media, everyday conversation |
> | Intimate | Private, highly familiar | Close relationships, family talk |
>
> The rhetorical power of register comes from its ability to:
>
> 1. Signal group membership and establish credibility
> 2. Create appropriate psychological distance or closeness with the audience
> 3. Frame the level of seriousness and urgency of your message
>
> Effective persuaders adjust their register dynamically, sometimes even within a single communication event, to maintain both authority and connection with their audience.

> [!example] Case Study: Register
>
> Register adaptation significantly impacts how the same essential message is received across different contexts. Consider these variations:
>
> **Political Communication Registers:**
>
> A policy expert discussing economic inequality might use:
>
> - **Academic Paper (Formal):** 
>   "Income disparities have demonstrated statistically significant expansion since the 1980s, with Gini coefficient increases averaging 0.3% annually when controlled for inflation."
>
> - **Congressional Testimony (Consultative):**
>   "The data shows that the gap between top earners and the middle class has been growing steadily for four decades. This trend has accelerated in recent years, particularly following the 2008 financial crisis."
>
> - **Town Hall Meeting (Casual-Consultative):**
>   "Folks, the numbers are clear: working families are getting a smaller piece of the pie every year, while the very top keeps taking more. This isn't an accident—it's the result of specific policies we can change."
>
> **Medical Communication Across Registers:**
>
> Information about diabetes management might appear as:
>
> 1. **Medical Journal (Formal):** 
>    Technical description of glycemic control mechanisms and intervention efficacy
>
> 2. **Doctor-Patient Consultation (Consultative):** 
>    "Your A1C levels indicate your average blood sugar has been too high for several months. Let's discuss adjusting your medication and some lifestyle changes that could help."
>
> 3. **Health Education Pamphlet (Casual):** 
>    "Managing diabetes is about balance. Think of insulin as a key that unlocks your cells so sugar can enter. Without enough keys, sugar builds up in your bloodstream instead."
>
> The most persuasive communicators consciously select their register based on:
> - Their relationship with the audience
> - The audience's expectations and knowledge level
> - The specific persuasive goals of the communication
> - The emotional state they wish to evoke
>
> Register misalignment often creates immediate barriers to persuasion that even the strongest logical arguments cannot overcome.

## 6. Guiding Principles for Content & Formatting

Please apply the following principles to create clear, effective, and well-structured notes:

1.  **Objective Language:** Maintain a neutral and factual tone. Describe concepts and processes objectively, without subjective evaluations (e.g., use "Method X involves..." instead of "Method X is the best way to...").

2.  **Clarity and Necessary Detail:**
    * **Primary Goal:** Ensure the core message of each callout is clear, understandable, and contains the necessary information to be meaningful.
    * **Completeness:** Include the details essential for understanding the specific point of the callout. Don't omit crucial information for the sake of brevity.

3.  **Conciseness (Efficiency and No Fluff):**
    * **Be Economical:** While ensuring clarity (Principle #2), use the fewest words necessary to convey the information accurately.
    * **Eliminate Redundancy:** Avoid repeating points, using filler words ("in order to," "basically," "actually"), or overly elaborate sentence structures. Be direct.
    * **Focus:** Stick closely to the specific topic of the callout title. Don't include tangential information or unnecessary background.

4.  **Modularity and Focused Callouts (Segmentation):**
    * **Principle:** Structure the notes into logical, modular callouts, each generally focused on a single distinct topic, concept, step, or aspect. This aids organization and readability.
    * **When to Segment:** Consider using separate callouts for clearly distinct parts of a larger topic. For example, define a concept in one `[!idea]` and illustrate it in a separate `[!example]`, or discuss different facets of a problem in separate `[!consider]` callouts.
    * **Coherence:** Balance modularity with clarity. It's acceptable to keep closely related points together within a single callout if separating them would make the information harder to understand, provided the callout remains focused on its main theme.

5.  **Readable Internal Structure (Enhancing Clarity):**
    * **Guideline:** Structure information *within* callouts to maximize readability and support learning (Goal #7). Using a mix of formats, such as brief introductory sentences combined with focused bullet points or small tables, is generally the most effective way to achieve this.
    * **Actively Avoid Monotony:** Please actively avoid callouts that consist *only* of a single block of paragraph text or *only* a list of bullets, as this typically hinders readability. Look for opportunities to structure the information, for example, with a lead sentence and supporting points. This is non negotiable. Providing callouts with single paragraphs will constitute a failure.
    * **Flexibility for Brevity:** For genuinely simple, self-contained points requiring only one or two clear sentences, that brief structure is fine. However, for anything needing even slight elaboration or listing points, apply structural variety (like intro + bullets) to aid comprehension. Use judgment focused on making it easy for a reader to understand.
    * **Start Content on New Line:** Always begin callout content on the line *after* the `> [!type] Title` header.

6.  **Final Output Wrapper:** Enclose the **entire** final note (all callout blocks) within a single Markdown code block for accurate copying:

```markdown
> [!type] Title
> Clear, concise content...

> [!type] Another Title
> More clear, concise content...
> - Supporting point 1 (no fluff).
> - Supporting point 2 (no fluff).
```

## 7. Overarching Goal: Effective Learning Resource

**Please keep this ultimate objective in mind throughout the note generation process:**

* **Primary Purpose:** The notes created using this template are intended first and foremost as **learning resources**. Their main goal is to **teach** the specified topic clearly and effectively. Think about creating notes that you yourself would find helpful for understanding the material.
* **Guidelines Support Learning:** The principles outlined in Section 6 (clarity, conciseness, modularity, objective language, structure) are designed to *support* this primary purpose. They are tools intended to make the information easier to understand, digest, and retain, not arbitrary rules.
* **Focus on Usefulness & Understanding:** While adhering to the guidelines is generally expected, it should not be a purely mechanical checklist exercise at the expense of the goal. The ultimate measure of success is whether the generated notes are **genuinely helpful, understandable, and educationally valuable** for someone learning the topic.
* **Educational Value is Paramount:** If you believe rigidly applying a specific guideline in a particular instance (for example, forcing segmentation that harms understanding, or being so concise on a complex point that it becomes confusing) would significantly detract from the clarity or educational value, **prioritize making the notes effective for learning.** Use your judgment to best balance the guidelines in service of this ultimate teaching goal. **Above all else, the notes must be useful and make sense as a learning tool.** The checklist is secondary to this core objective.

**Checklist (Internal AI Use - Comprehensive Review Against Principles & Goal):**

* [ ] **Objectivity:** Is the language neutral, factual, and free of subjective evaluations or bias (Principle 1)?
* [ ] **Clarity & Conciseness:** Does the content clearly convey the necessary information for understanding (Principle 2) AND is it expressed efficiently, directly, and without fluff or redundancy (Principle 3)? Is the balance appropriate?
* [ ] **Segmentation (Modularity):** Are distinct topics, concepts, steps, or facets appropriately segmented into separate, focused callouts to enhance organisation and readability (Principle 4)? Was segmentation used effectively without making the flow disjointed where coherence was needed?
* [ ] **Internal Structure & Readability:** Does the internal structure of EACH callout enhance readability (Guideline 5)? Specifically:
    * [ ] Does it generally use a mix of formats (e.g., brief intro + bullets/table)?
    * [ ] Does it actively avoid monotony (i.e., NOT just a single paragraph AND NOT just a bullet list, unless the point was extremely brief and simple per the guideline)?
* [ ] **Basic Formatting:** Does content start on a new line after the callout header (Guideline 5)?
* [ ] **Sequence Adherence:** If a specific callout sequence table was provided (Section 5), was it followed precisely in terms of order, type, and title?
* [ ] **Structure Adherence**: Was the structure of callouts followed completely? If x callouts was requested, were x callouts made? Are you certain that it exactly this structure and not more / less?
* [ ] **Output Wrapper:** Is the entire final output correctly enclosed in a single ```markdown code block (Principle 6)?
* [ ] **Overall Goal Alignment:** Critically considering Section 7, does the final output effectively serve the primary goal of being a genuinely useful, clear, and understandable learning resource? Does it prioritize educational value?
