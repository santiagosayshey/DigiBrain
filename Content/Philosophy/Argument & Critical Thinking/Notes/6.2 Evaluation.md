> [!motivation] Selecting Between Explanations
> A detective has three possible suspects for a crime. A scientist examines multiple hypotheses about climate change. A doctor considers different diagnoses for a set of symptoms.
> 
> These situations share a common challenge: **how do we choose between competing explanations?** When multiple explanations could account for our observations, we need systematic criteria to evaluate them.

> [!idea] Criteria for Evaluation
> We need a way to systematically evaluate competing explanations. These **criteria provide a framework for assessing the strength of potential explanations**, helping us select the most viable options from alternatives.
>
> | Criterion | Description | Example in Science |
> |-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
> | Testability | Explanation must generate specific predictions that can be proven false | Einstein's theory predicted light bending around stars during solar eclipse |
> | Mechanism | Must describe a concrete process showing how causes lead to effects | Germ theory explains disease transmission through specific microorganisms |
> | Predictive Power | Should successfully predict phenomena not yet observed when formulated | Mendeleev's periodic table predicted properties of undiscovered elements |
> | Explanatory Scope | Should explain a broad range of related phenomena, not just isolated cases | Maxwell's equations explain electricity, magnetism, and light as one phenomenon |
> | Ockham's Razor | Choose the explanation with fewest assumptions that explains all evidence | Copernican model eliminated need for complex epicycles in planetary motion |
> | Conservatism | New explanation should preserve successful aspects of existing theories | Quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics at large scales |
>
> These criteria often trade off against each other - an explanation might excel at some while performing poorly on others.
