> [!motivation] Faulty Reasoning
>
> While formal argumentation involves structured steps like presenting premises and evaluating soundness or validity, **everyday communication rarely adheres to such strict formats.** In real-world discussions, arguments are often presented imperfectly, and the reasoning employed can be flawed.
> - The challenge lies in **recognizing these errors in reasoning,** both in others' arguments and our own.
> - Understanding how to identify these common pitfalls is crucial for critical thinking and **avoiding being misled by defective arguments.**

> [!idea] Fallacies
>
> Faulty reasoning often manifests as "fallacies," which are **errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument.** Unlike sound deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning where the truth of premises generally supports the truth of the conclusion, fallacies lead to invalid or unsound conclusions even if the premises seem plausible.
>
> Fallacies can be broadly categorized:
> - **Formal Fallacies**: These are errors in the logical structure or form of an argument. The argument is invalid because of how it is constructed, regardless of the truth or falsity of its content. If the form is flawed, any argument using that form is a formal fallacy.
>     - *Example Idea*: A flawed blueprint for a house (the structure) will result in an unstable house, no matter how good the building materials (the content) are.
> - **Informal Fallacies**: These are errors related to the content, context, or delivery of an argument, rather than its logical structure. The argument's structure might appear valid, but the reasoning is flawed due to issues like irrelevant information, ambiguity, assumptions, or emotional appeals.
>     - *Example Idea*: An argument might have a correct logical form, but if it's based on incorrect facts, misleading language, or aims to distract, it becomes an informal fallacy. The same logical structure with different, accurate content might not be fallacious.
>
> The key distinction is that formal fallacies are about the *invalidity of the argument's form*, while informal fallacies are about *unsoundness arising from the argument's content or context*.

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: Affirming the Consequent
>
> Affirming the consequent is a formal fallacy that occurs when one incorrectly assumes that if the consequent (the "then" part) of a conditional statement is true, then the antecedent (the "if" part) must also be true. This fallacy confuses necessary and sufficient conditions.
>
> - **Logical Form:**
>   1. If P, then Q.
>   2. Q is true.
>   3. Therefore, P is true. (Fallacious inference)
>
> - **Explanation of Error:** In a statement "If P, then Q," P is a **sufficient condition** for Q (P being true is enough to guarantee Q is true). Q is a **necessary condition** for P (if P is true, then Q *must* be true). However, Q being true does not make Q a sufficient condition to conclude P. The fallacy arises from treating Q as if it were a sufficient condition for P, ignoring that other conditions (besides P) might also lead to Q.
>
> - **Example:**
>   - **Premise 1:** If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).
>     - *Here, raining (P) is a sufficient condition for the ground being wet (Q). The ground being wet (Q) is a necessary condition if it is indeed raining (P).*
>   - **Premise 2:** The ground is wet (Q is true).
>   - **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, it is raining (P is true).
>
>   This is fallacious because while rain is sufficient to make the ground wet, the ground being wet is not sufficient to conclude it's raining. Other causes (e.g., sprinklers, a spilled bucket of water) could make the ground wet. The argument incorrectly infers the specific sufficient condition (P) from the observation of a necessary condition (Q).

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: Denying the Antecedent
>
> Denying the antecedent is a formal fallacy where one incorrectly concludes that if the antecedent (the "if" part) of a conditional statement is false, then the consequent (the "then" part) must also be false. This fallacy also stems from a misunderstanding of necessary and sufficient conditions.
>
> - **Logical Form:**
>   1. If P, then Q.
>   2. P is false (Not P).
>   3. Therefore, Q is false (Therefore, Not Q). (Fallacious inference)
>
> - **Explanation of Error:**
>   In the statement "If P, then Q," P is a **sufficient condition** for Q (P's truth guarantees Q's truth). However, P is not necessarily a **necessary condition** for Q (Q could still be true even if P is false, due to other factors).
>   The fallacy occurs by incorrectly assuming that because the specific sufficient condition P is not met, Q cannot occur. It overlooks other potential sufficient conditions for Q.
>
> - **Example:**
>   - **Premise 1:** If it is raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).
>     - *Raining (P) is a sufficient condition for the ground being wet (Q).*
>   - **Premise 2:** It is not raining (P is false).
>   - **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, the ground is not wet (Q is false).
>
>   This is fallacious because the ground could still be wet for other reasons even if it's not raining (e.g., sprinklers were on, someone spilled water). Denying the specific antecedent (rain) doesn't negate the consequent (wet ground) if other causes exist.

> [!example] Formal Fallacy: The Undistributed Middle
>
> The fallacy of the undistributed middle is a formal error that occurs in categorical syllogisms. A categorical syllogism has two premises and a conclusion, and involves three terms, each appearing twice. The "middle term" is the one that appears in both premises but not in the conclusion. For the syllogism to be valid, this middle term must be "distributed" in at least one premise, meaning the premise makes a claim about all members of the class designated by that term.
>
> - **Problem Structure:**
>   1. All A are B. (Major premise)
>   2. All C are B. (Minor premise)
>   3. Therefore, all A are C. (Fallacious conclusion)
>   Here, 'B' is the middle term. In both premises, 'B' is the predicate and is undistributed. We know something about things that are A (they are B) and things that are C (they are also B), but we don't know if the set of A's and the set of C's have any necessary overlap just because they both share the property of being B.
>
> - **Explanation of Error:**
>   The middle term fails to connect the major term (A) and the minor term (C) because neither premise tells us anything about *all* members of the class B. Both A and C share a property B, but this doesn't mean A and C are related to each other. It's like saying two people live in the same city (middle term), therefore they must live in the same house (fallacious connection).
>
> - **Example:**
>   - **Premise 1:** All dogs (A) are mammals (B).
>     - *(The middle term "mammals" (B) is undistributed here; this premise tells us something about all dogs, but not all mammals.)*
>   - **Premise 2:** All cats (C) are mammals (B).
>     - *(The middle term "mammals" (B) is also undistributed here; this premise tells us something about all cats, but not all mammals.)*
>   - **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, all dogs (A) are cats (C).
>
>   The conclusion is clearly false. Both dogs and cats belong to the larger class of mammals, but this shared characteristic doesn't mean they are the same thing or that one is a subset of the other in the way the conclusion claims. The middle term "mammals" doesn't adequately link "dogs" and "cats" because it's not distributed in either premise.


> [!example] Formal Fallacy: Base Rate Neglect
>
> Base Rate Neglect is a fallacy where a judgment about the probability of an event is made by focusing on specific, individuating information (case-specific details) while ignoring or underweighting the general statistical frequency of that event (the "base rate"). This leads to an argument where the conclusion is not properly supported, even if the premises about the specific information seem plausible.
>
> - **Example Argument Structure Exhibiting Base Rate Neglect:**
>   Consider the following line of reasoning:
>   1. **Premise 1:** Most people who belong to Group X (e.g., criminals) exhibit Characteristic A (e.g., "look dangerous").
>      - *This suggests that if someone is in Group X, they are likely to have Characteristic A.*
>   2. **Premise 2:** Very few people who do *not* belong to Group X (e.g., non-criminals) exhibit Characteristic A.
>      - *This suggests that if someone is not in Group X, they are unlikely to have Characteristic A.*
>   3. **Premise 3 (Observation):** Individual Y exhibits Characteristic A ("looks dangerous").
>   4. **Fallacious Conclusion:** Therefore, Individual Y probably belongs to Group X (is a criminal).
>
> - **Crucial Missing Information (The Base Rate):**
>   The argument is fallacious because it fails to consider the **base rate** of Group X in the overall population. That is, what proportion of the total population actually belongs to Group X?
>
> - **Explanation of Error:**
>   Even if Premises 1 and 2 are true, the conclusion can be false if the base rate of Group X is very low.
>   - For instance, imagine criminals (Group X) make up only 0.1% of a population, while non-criminals make up 99.9%.
>   - Let's say "most" in P1 means 80% of criminals "look dangerous." So, $0.1\% \times 80\% = 0.08\%$ of the total population are criminals who look dangerous.
>   - Let's say "very few" in P2 means 1% of non-criminals "look dangerous." So, $99.9\% \times 1\% \approx 0.999\%$ of the total population are non-criminals who look dangerous.
>   - In this scenario, the number of non-criminals who "look dangerous" ($0.999\%$ of the population) is much larger than the number of criminals who "look dangerous" ($0.08\%$ of the population).
>   - Thus, if you meet someone who "looks dangerous" (Characteristic A), it's actually more probable they are a non-criminal, despite Premises 1 and 2.
>
>   The fallacy occurs by being swayed by the descriptive link between the characteristic and the group, without factoring in how common or rare the group is in the first place. The argument incorrectly estimates the probability P(Group X | Characteristic A) by ignoring P(Group X).
