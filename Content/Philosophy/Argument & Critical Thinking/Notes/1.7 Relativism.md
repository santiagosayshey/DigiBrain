> [!motivation] Whats true for you might not be true for me

> When people disagree, we often face a fundamental question: can contradictory beliefs both be true?
> 
> Consider these scenarios:
> 
> - Two cultures with opposing views on appropriate eating customs
> - Individuals with different political ideologies interpreting the same economic data
> - Religious and scientific explanations for natural phenomena
> 
> These disagreements raise the possibility that truth might not be universal but instead depends on perspective, background, or cultural context.

> [!idea] Relativism - Interesting vs Boring Relativism
> 
> Relativism holds that truth, knowledge, or morality are relative to particular frameworks rather than absolute.
> 
> **Boring (Trivial) Relativism:**
> 
> - Acknowledges that statements contain implicit reference points
> - Examples: "This food is spicy" depends on taste sensitivity; "It's late" depends on time zone
> - Not philosophically controversial - just recognizes contextual factors
> 
> **Interesting (Substantive) Relativism:**
> 
> - Claims that seemingly objective matters can be relative
> - Challenges the existence of universal truths in domains like science, ethics, or logic
> - Example: Scientific "facts" are shaped by theoretical paradigms and cultural assumptions
> - Philosophically significant as it questions fundamental assumptions about reality
> 
> **Key Distinction:** Boring relativism is resolved by clarifying context, while interesting relativism maintains that contradictory claims about the same subject can both be true within different frameworks.

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | I say 'There's a bank in Bindford' and you say 'There's a bank in Bindford'. What I say is true and what you say is false. This is because we're using the term 'bank' differently: I'm talking about a financial bank and you a river bank. | Boring                            |
| 2   | Mary claims that Jesus is the son of God. Isaac, a Jew, denies this. Olaf insists that, though they disagree, Mary and Isaac are both right: that Jesus is the son of God is true from a Christian perspective but false from a Jewish one.  | Interesting                       |
| 3   | Dick and Dan are having a phone conversation. Dan is in Denver and Dick in New York. Both say 'It's raining here'. However, one of them is correct while the other is lying.                                                                 | Boring                            |
> [!consider] Plato's Objection to Relativism
> 
> Plato challenged relativism through his critique of Protagoras' claim that "man is the measure of all things."
> 
> **Self-Refutation Problem:**
> 
> - If all truth is relative, is that statement itself relative or absolute?
> - If relative, then relativism isn't universally true
> - If absolute, then relativism contradicts itself by claiming at least one non-relative truth
> 
> **Other Platonic Objections:**
> 
> - Relativism confuses appearance with reality
> - It undermines the possibility of genuine knowledge (episteme) vs. mere opinion (doxa)
> - Relativism makes education pointless if all perspectives are equally valid
> 
> Plato argued instead for objective Forms/Ideas that provide absolute standards of truth independent of human perception.

> [!consider] Problems with Moral Relativism
> 
> Despite its appeal for promoting tolerance, moral relativism faces serious philosophical challenges:
> 
> **Self-Contradiction in Application:**
> 
> - People typically apply relativism selectively
> - They relativize practices like polygamy but consider others (genocide, slavery) absolutely wrong
> - This inconsistency suggests most self-described relativists actually retain absolute moral standards
> 
> **Undermines Universal Standards:**
> 
> - Cannot condemn atrocities as objectively wrong
> - Example: Would have to say Holocaust was "wrong-for-us but right-for-Nazis"
> 
> **False Dichotomy:**
> 
> - Rejecting relativism doesn't require arrogance or closed-mindedness
> - One can believe in objective moral truths while acknowledging limited ability to access them
> - Non-relativists can still be tolerant, open-minded, and willing to learn from other cultures
> 
> **Tolerance Paradox:**
> 
> - If tolerance is a virtue only relative to our culture, relativists cannot consistently promote it as universally applicable
> - When faced with intolerant cultures, relativists must concede intolerance is "right for them"

> [!consider] The Self-Justification Problem of Reasoning
> 
> A particularly powerful argument for relativism comes from examining the foundations of logical and scientific reasoning itself.
> 
> **The Circularity Problem:**
> 
> - To justify traditional logic/scientific reasoning, we must use reasoning
> - But if we use the same form of reasoning to justify itself, our justification is circular
> - Example: Using Dave's trust in The Great Mystica - if he justifies this trust by appealing to what she says about her own reliability, his justification is circular
> 
> **The Relativist Conclusion:**
> 
> - No form of reasoning can ultimately justify itself without circularity
> - Alternative reasoning systems (mystical, intuitive, etc.) face the same justification problem
> - This suggests all reasoning systems are equally unjustifiable at their foundation
> 
> **Important Limitation:**
> 
> - While this problem shows we cannot prove our reasoning methods are "correct"
> - It does not establish that all reasoning methods are equally valid
> - The inability to justify a method doesn't mean it isn't objectively better
> - Relativism about reasoning doesn't automatically follow from the justification problem
