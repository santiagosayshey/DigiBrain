> [!motivation] Whats true for you might not be true for me
> 
> When people disagree, we often face a fundamental question: can contradictory beliefs both be true?
> 
> Consider these scenarios:
> 
> - Two cultures with opposing views on appropriate eating customs
> - Individuals with different political ideologies interpreting the same economic data
> - Religious and scientific explanations for natural phenomena
> 
> These disagreements raise the possibility that truth might not be universal but instead depends on perspective, background, or cultural context.

> [!idea] Relativism - Interesting vs Boring Relativism
> 
> Relativism holds that truth, knowledge, or morality are relative to particular frameworks rather than absolute.
> 
> **Boring (Trivial) Relativism:**
> 
> - Acknowledges that statements contain implicit reference points
> - Examples: "This food is spicy" depends on taste sensitivity; "It's late" depends on time zone
> - Not philosophically controversial - just recognizes contextual factors
> 
> **Interesting (Substantive) Relativism:**
> 
> - Claims that seemingly objective matters can be relative
> - Challenges the existence of universal truths in domains like science, ethics, or logic
> - Example: Scientific "facts" are shaped by theoretical paradigms and cultural assumptions
> - Philosophically significant as it questions fundamental assumptions about reality
