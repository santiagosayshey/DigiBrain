> [!motivation] Whats true for you might not be true for me

> When people disagree, we often face a fundamental question: can contradictory beliefs both be true?
> 
> Consider these scenarios:
> 
> - Two cultures with opposing views on appropriate eating customs
> - Individuals with different political ideologies interpreting the same economic data
> - Religious and scientific explanations for natural phenomena
> 
> These disagreements raise the possibility that truth might not be universal but instead depends on perspective, background, or cultural context.

> [!idea] Relativism - Interesting vs Boring Relativism
> 
> Relativism holds that truth, knowledge, or morality are relative to particular frameworks rather than absolute.
> 
> **Boring (Trivial) Relativism:**
> 
> - Acknowledges that statements contain implicit reference points
> - Examples: "This food is spicy" depends on taste sensitivity; "It's late" depends on time zone
> - Not philosophically controversial - just recognizes contextual factors
> 
> **Interesting (Substantive) Relativism:**
> 
> - Claims that seemingly objective matters can be relative
> - Challenges the existence of universal truths in domains like science, ethics, or logic
> - Example: Scientific "facts" are shaped by theoretical paradigms and cultural assumptions
> - Philosophically significant as it questions fundamental assumptions about reality

| 1   | I say 'There's a bank in Bindford' and you say 'There's a bank in Bindford'. What I say is true and what you say is false. This is because we're using the term 'bank' differently: I'm talking about a financial bank and you a river bank. | Boring                            |
| 2   | Mary claims that Jesus is the son of God. Isaac, a Jew, denies this. Olaf insists that, though they disagree, Mary and Isaac are both right: that Jesus is the son of God is true from a Christian perspective but false from a Jewish one.  |                                   |
| 3   | Dick and Dan are having a phone conversation. Dan is in Denver and Dick in New York. Both say 'It's raining here'. However, one of them is correct while the other is lying.                                                                 |                                   |
