> [!motivation] Reasoning in Everyday Life
> 
> We've examined how to analyze existing arguments, but **what about when we need to construct our own?** Daily life constantly requires us to develop reasons that support conclusions.
> 
> - Whether deciding what to eat for lunch
> - Which route to take to work
> - How to allocate our budget We need tools to move beyond analyzing arguments to creating effective ones ourselves.

> [!idea] Reasoning
> 
> Reasoning is the cognitive process of **drawing conclusions from premises through logical connections.**
> 
> - Involves recognizing patterns and relationships
> - Applies principles to new situations
> - Forms the foundation of argument construction
> 
> Types of reasoning:
> 
> |Type|Description|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Deductive|From general to specific|All humans need water; Sam is human; therefore Sam needs water|
> |Inductive|From specific to general|Every swan observed is white; therefore all swans might be white|
> |Abductive|Best explanation|The grass is wet; it likely rained|

> [!example] Everyday Reasoning
> 
> We reason constantly throughout our daily lives:
> 
> - **Practical decisions**: "This route has less traffic, so I'll arrive faster"
> - **Consumer choices**: "This product costs more but lasts longer, making it more economical"
> - **Social interactions**: "She hasn't responded to my message, perhaps she's busy"
> - **Health choices**: "I feel better when I exercise regularly, so I should continue"
> 
> Each instance involves connecting premises (observations, facts) to conclusions through logical steps.

> [!consider] Inference
> 
> Inference is the process of **deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true.**
> 
> - Forms the core mechanism of reasoning
> - Allows us to see what follows from what
> - Bridges the gap between established knowledge and new conclusions
> 
> Qualities of sound inference:
> 
> - Validity: conclusion follows logically from premises
> - Soundness: valid structure with true premises
> - Strength: degree to which premises support conclusion (for inductive reasoning)

> [!example] Common Inferences
> 
> **Daily inferences**:
> 
> - Weather inference: "Dark clouds are gathering; it will probably rain"
> - Social inference: "He smiled when I entered; he's pleased to see me"
> - Technical inference: "The computer won't turn on; the power supply might be faulty"
> 
> **Inference patterns**:
> 
> - Modus ponens: If P then Q; P; therefore Q
> - Modus tollens: If P then Q; not Q; therefore not P
> - Disjunctive syllogism: Either P or Q; not P; therefore Q
