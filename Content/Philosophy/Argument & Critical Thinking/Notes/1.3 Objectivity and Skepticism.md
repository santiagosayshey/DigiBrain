> [!motivation] How Things Are
> 
> Critical thinking uses arguments to define how things really are, free of subjectivity and bias.
> 
> - Arguments serve as the primary method for establishing objective truths
> - Other approaches like observation, experimentation, and data analysis complement arguments
> - Understanding reality accurately requires systematic reasoning methods
> 
> The challenge lies in determining which claims accurately represent reality and which are merely opinions or falsehoods. This is where structured reasoning through arguments becomes essential.

> [!idea] Objectivity
> 
> Objectivity means **evaluating information based on evidence rather than personal biases**.
> 
> - Acknowledges and sets aside personal preferences
> - Uses consistent standards when examining different claims
> - Separates facts from emotions and opinions
> 
> |Component|Description|
> |---|---|
> |Evidence focus|Relies on verifiable data|
> |Bias awareness|Recognizes personal influences|
> |Multiple perspectives|Considers different viewpoints|

> [!idea] Skepticism
> 
> Skepticism involves **questioning claims before accepting them as valid**.
> 
> - Asks for evidence rather than accepting claims on authority
> - Differs from cynicism (automatic rejection without examination)
> - Applies proportional doubt based on the claim's significance
> Being skeptical is really easy. We need to ask 4 basic questions:
> 1. Why should I trust this claim?
> 2. Why does the person making this claim believe it - or want me to believe it?
> 3. What else has been said, written or reported about this?
> 4. Do i know enough to answer all of the above questions confidently? 
> 
> |Aspect|Application|
> |---|---|
> |Source evaluation|Assessing reliability of information sources|
> |Claim assessment|Examining plausibility of statements|
> |Evidence analysis|Determining if evidence supports conclusions|

> [!consider] Perfect vs. Good
> 
> We can never be entirely objective or skeptical in all situations. "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."
> 
> - Complete objectivity is impossibleâ€”everyone has inherent biases
> - Perfect skepticism would paralyze decision-making
> - The goal is improvement rather than perfection

> [!idea] Spectrum of Reliability
> 
> Information exists on a **spectrum of reliability** that determines when critical thinking is most needed.
> 
> - Not all claims require the same level of scrutiny
> - Critical thinking should be applied proportionally to importance
> 
> |Information Type|When Critical Thinking Matters Most|
> |---|---|
> |Health and safety|High stakes require thorough evaluation|
> |Major decisions|Financial/life choices need careful analysis|
> |Daily preferences|Personal choices often need minimal scrutiny|
> |Emergency situations|Balance speed with accuracy|
