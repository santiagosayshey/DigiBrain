> [!motivation] Reasoning in Everyday Life
> 
> We've examined how to analyze existing arguments, but **what about when we need to construct our own?** Daily life constantly requires us to develop reasons that support conclusions.
> 
> - Whether deciding what to eat for lunch
> - Which route to take to work
> - How to allocate our budget We need tools to move beyond analyzing arguments to creating effective ones ourselves.

> [!idea] Reasoning
> 
> Reasoning is the cognitive process of **drawing conclusions from premises through logical connections.**
> 
> - Involves recognizing patterns and relationships
> - Applies principles to new situations
> - Forms the foundation of argument construction
> 
> Types of reasoning:
> 
> |Type|Description|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Deductive|From general to specific|All humans need water; Sam is human; therefore Sam needs water|
> |Inductive|From specific to general|Every swan observed is white; therefore all swans might be white|
> |Abductive|Best explanation|The grass is wet; it likely rained|

> [!example] Everyday Reasoning
> 
> We reason constantly throughout our daily lives:
> 
> - **Practical decisions**: "This route has less traffic, so I'll arrive faster"
> - **Consumer choices**: "This product costs more but lasts longer, making it more economical"
> - **Social interactions**: "She hasn't responded to my message, perhaps she's busy"
> - **Health choices**: "I feel better when I exercise regularly, so I should continue"
> 
> Each instance involves connecting premises (observations, facts) to conclusions through logical steps.

> [!consider] Inference
> 
> Inference is the process of **deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true.**
> 
> - Forms the core mechanism of reasoning
> - Allows us to see what follows from what
> - Bridges the gap between established knowledge and new conclusions
> 
> Qualities of sound inference:
> 
> - Validity: conclusion follows logically from premises
> - Soundness: valid structure with true premises
> - Strength: degree to which premises support conclusion (for inductive reasoning)

> [!example] Common Inferences
> 
> **Daily inferences**:
> 
> - Weather inference: "Dark clouds are gathering; it will probably rain"
> - Social inference: "He smiled when I entered; he's pleased to see me"
> - Technical inference: "The computer won't turn on; the power supply might be faulty"
> 
> **Inference patterns**:
> 
> - Modus ponens: If P then Q; P; therefore Q
> - Modus tollens: If P then Q; not Q; therefore not P
> - Disjunctive syllogism: Either P or Q; not P; therefore Q

> [!consider] Inference vs. Implication
> 
> Inference and implication are **complementary but distinct** processes in reasoning:
> 
> **Inference** (what listeners/readers do):
> 
> - The act of **deriving conclusions from premises**
> - Performed by the person receiving information
> - "I infer that the ground is wet because it rained"
> 
> **Implication** (what speakers/writers do):
> 
> - The **suggestion of an idea without explicitly stating it**
> - Created by the person providing information
> - "Dark clouds imply that it might rain soon"
> 
> |Process|Actor|Direction|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Inference|Audience|Draws conclusions from given information|Reader infers the character is lying based on textual clues|
> |Implication|Communicator|Suggests or hints at meaning|Writer implies criticism through subtle language choices|
> 
> Understanding this distinction helps prevent misattribution of responsibility in communication.

> [!example] Inference Examples
> 
> **Example 1: Medical Inference**
> 
> - Given information: Patient has a fever, sore throat, and tested positive for strep bacteria
> - Inference: The doctor infers that the patient has strep throat
> 
> **Example 2: Social Inference**
> 
> - Given information: Friend hasn't replied to messages in three days but is active on social media
> - Inference: You infer they might be avoiding the conversation
> 
> **Example 3: Scientific Inference**
> 
> - Given information: Fossil evidence shows similarities between extinct and modern species
> - Inference: Scientists infer evolutionary relationships between these organisms

> [!example] Implication Examples
> 
> **Example 1: Political Implication**
> 
> - Statement: "Unlike my opponent, I've never taken donations from oil companies"
> - Implication: The speaker implies their opponent is influenced by corporate interests
> 
> **Example 2: Social Implication**
> 
> - Statement: "I noticed the dishes have been in the sink for three days now"
> - Implication: The speaker implies someone should wash the dishes
> 
> **Example 3: Academic Implication**
> 
> - Statement: "This theory has been challenged by several recent studies"
> - Implication: The professor implies the theory may no longer be valid or reliable

> [!idea] Argument
> 
> An argument is a form of reasoning used to **persuade someone by providing logical support for a conclusion.**
> 
> - Consists of a conclusion (what you want others to accept) supported by reasons (why they should accept it)
> - Connects evidence to claims through logical relationships
> - Aims to change beliefs or actions through rational persuasion rather than force
> 
> Structure of an argument:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Premises/Reasons|Provide support|"Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health"|
> |Conclusion|The claim being argued for|"Therefore, you should exercise regularly"|
> 
> Unlike mere assertions, arguments provide justification for why the audience should accept the conclusion.

> [!consider] Arguments and Inference
> 
> Arguments and inference are intrinsically connected in the reasoning process:
> 
> - **Arguments provide the framework** that guides others toward making specific inferences
> - When constructing an argument, you are creating a path of reasoning that leads others to infer your conclusion
> - The strength of an argument depends on how naturally the audience can infer the conclusion from the premises
> 
> Connection points:
> 
> - Arguments explicitly state both premises and conclusions
> - Inference is the mental process of moving from premises to conclusion
> - Effective arguments anticipate the inferential patterns of the audience
> 
> |In Arguments|In Inference|
> |---|---|
> |We provide premises intentionally|We recognize patterns in information|
> |We state conclusions explicitly|We arrive at conclusions through cognitive processing|
> |We structure reasoning for others|We follow reasoning paths (our own or others')|
> 
> When you construct an argument, you're essentially designing an inferential pathway for your audience to follow.

> [!idea] Deduction
> 
> Deduction is a **type of inference that derives specific conclusions from general premises through strict logical necessity.**
> 
> - Moves from general principles to specific instances
> - When premises are true, the conclusion must be true
> - Creates certainty rather than probability
> 
> Structure of deductive reasoning:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Major premise|States a general rule|"All mammals have lungs"|
> |Minor premise|Identifies a specific case|"Whales are mammals"|
> |Conclusion|Applies the rule to the case|"Therefore, whales have lungs"|
> 
> Common deductive forms:
> 
> - Syllogisms: structured arguments with major premise, minor premise, conclusion
> - Modus ponens: If P then Q; P is true; therefore Q must be true
> - Modus tollens: If P then Q; Q is false; therefore P must be false

> [!consider] Limitations of Deduction
> 
> Despite its logical power, most everyday reasoning isn't purely deductive:
> 
> - **Limited general rules**: We rarely have access to absolutely true universal premises ("All swans are white" was believed until black swans were discovered)
> - **Incomplete information**: Real-world situations involve uncertainty and gaps in knowledge
> - **Practical complexity**: Many decisions require weighing probabilities rather than certainties
> 
> Everyday reasoning constraints:
> 
> - New situations often don't fit cleanly into existing general rules
> - Exceptions exist for most general principles
> - Context-specific factors may not be captured in deductive frameworks
> 
> |Deductive Ideals|Real-world Constraints|
> |---|---|
> |Complete knowledge|Partial information|
> |Universal truths|Contextual truths|
> |Binary certainty|Degrees of likelihood|
> 
> This is why we rely on multiple reasoning approaches, including induction and abduction, for most real-world problem-solving.

> [!idea] Induction
> 
> Induction is a **form of inference that draws general conclusions from specific observations or instances.**
> 
> - Moves from specific cases to general principles
> - Generates probable rather than certain conclusions
> - Strengthens with additional supporting evidence
> 
> Structure of inductive reasoning:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Observations|Specific instances|"The sun has risen every day in recorded history"|
> |Pattern recognition|Identifying regularities|"This forms a consistent pattern without exceptions"|
> |Generalization|Extending to unobserved cases|"The sun will rise tomorrow"|
> 
> Types of inductive reasoning:
> 
> - Generalization: from sample to population
> - Analogical: from similarities in known attributes to similarities in unknown attributes
> - Causal: from observed correlation to causal relationship

> [!example] Deduction vs. Induction: Validity and Strength
> 
> **Deductive Argument**: Reasoning from certainty
> 
> - Premise 1: All humans are mortal
> - Premise 2: Socrates is human
> - Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal
> 
> This deductive **argument is valid - the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.** If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true with absolute certainty.
> 
> **Inductive Argument**: Reasoning from uncertainty
> 
> - Observation 1: The sun has risen every morning for thousands of years
> - Observation 2: The laws of planetary motion have been consistent
> - Conclusion: The sun will rise tomorrow
> 
> This inductive argument is **not valid - despite strong evidence, the conclusion is not guaranteed**. Even with true premises, the conclusion could still be false (e.g., if a cosmic event disrupted the Earth's rotation).
> 
> |Aspect|Deduction|Induction|
> |---|---|---|
> |Logical status|Valid (when properly formed)|Never valid (in strict logical terms)|
> |Certainty|Guaranteed if premises are true|Not guaranteed even with true premises|
> |Evaluation|Valid or invalid|Strong or weak|
> |Knowledge type|Explicates what is contained in premises|Extends beyond premises to new knowledge|
> 
> Inductive reasoning, while invaluable for science and everyday reasoning, always involves a "leap" beyond what is strictly entailed by the premises.
