> [!motivation] Reasoning with Uncertainty
> 
> In formal logic and mathematics, we rely on deductive reasoning where conclusions necessarily follow from premises with complete certainty. However, this form of reasoning rarely applies to real-world situations. Most of our daily decision-making involves incomplete information and probabilistic thinking. We make weather predictions despite atmospheric complexity, diagnose illnesses without perfect information, and assess risks in financial markets with limited data. This uncertainty is inherent in nearly all practical reasoning scenarios, requiring us to develop methods for drawing useful conclusions despite imperfect knowledge. Understanding how to reason effectively under uncertainty is therefore essential for navigating the ambiguities of everyday life and scientific inquiry.

> [!idea] Induction
> 
> Induction is a **form of inference that draws general conclusions from specific observations or instances.**
> 
> - Moves from specific cases to general principles
> - Generates probable rather than certain conclusions
> - Strengthens with additional supporting evidence
> 
> Structure of inductive reasoning:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Observations|Specific instances|"The sun has risen every day in recorded history"|
> |Pattern recognition|Identifying regularities|"This forms a consistent pattern without exceptions"|
> |Generalization|Extending to unobserved cases|"The sun will rise tomorrow"|
> 
> Types of inductive reasoning:
> 
> - Generalization: from sample to population
> - Analogical: from similarities in known attributes to similarities in unknown attributes
> - Causal: from observed correlation to causal relationship

> [!example] Deduction vs. Induction: Validity and Strength
> 
> **Deductive Argument**: Reasoning from certainty
> 
> - Premise 1: All humans are mortal
> - Premise 2: Socrates is human
> - Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal
> 
> This deductive **argument is valid - the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.** If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true with absolute certainty.
> 
> **Inductive Argument**: Reasoning from uncertainty
> 
> - Observation 1: The sun has risen every morning for thousands of years
> - Observation 2: The laws of planetary motion have been consistent
> - Conclusion: The sun will rise tomorrow
> 
> This inductive argument is **not valid - despite strong evidence, the conclusion is not guaranteed**. Even with true premises, the conclusion could still be false (e.g., if a cosmic event disrupted the Earth's rotation).
> 
> |Aspect|Deduction|Induction|
> |---|---|---|
> |Logical status|Valid (when properly formed)|Never valid (in strict logical terms)|
> |Certainty|Guaranteed if premises are true|Not guaranteed even with true premises|
> |Evaluation|Valid or invalid|Strong or weak|
> |Knowledge type|Explicates what is contained in premises|Extends beyond premises to new knowledge|
> 
> Inductive reasoning, while invaluable for science and everyday reasoning, always involves a "leap" beyond what is strictly entailed by the premises.
