> [!motivation] Reasoning with Uncertainty
> 
> The world rarely presents us with absolute certainties. While deductive reasoning gives us concrete, definitive conclusions, most real-world situations involve incomplete information and varying degrees of confidence.
> 
> Consider these everyday scenarios:
> 
> - Weather forecasting uses probabilities rather than certainties
> - Medical diagnoses often involve weighing multiple possible conditions
> - Investment decisions account for various market uncertainties
> 
> Deductive reasoning, where conclusions follow necessarily from premises, represents only a small fraction of human reasoning. **Most reasoning involves drawing plausible but uncertain conclusions from available evidence.**

> [!idea] Induction
> 
> Induction is a **form of inference that draws general conclusions from specific observations or instances.** It *infers* a claim from an *imperfect* generalization. 
> 
> - Moves from specific cases to general principles
> - Generates probable rather than certain conclusions
> - Strengthens with additional supporting evidence
> 
> Structure of inductive reasoning:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Observations|Specific instances|"The sun has risen every day in recorded history"|
> |Pattern recognition|Identifying regularities|"This forms a consistent pattern without exceptions"|
> |Generalization|Extending to unobserved cases|"The sun will rise tomorrow"|
> 
> Types of inductive reasoning:
> 
> - Generalization: from sample to population
> - Analogical: from similarities in known attributes to similarities in unknown attributes
> - Causal: from observed correlation to causal relationship

> [!example] Deduction vs. Induction: Validity and Strength
> 
> **Deductive Argument**: Reasoning from certainty
> 
> - Premise 1: All humans are mortal
> - Premise 2: Socrates is human
> - Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal
> 
> This deductive **argument is valid - the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.** If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true with absolute certainty.
> 
> **Inductive Argument**: Reasoning from uncertainty
> 
> - Observation 1: The sun has risen every morning for thousands of years
> - Observation 2: The laws of planetary motion have been consistent
> - Conclusion: The sun will rise tomorrow
> 
> This inductive argument is **not valid - despite strong evidence, the conclusion is not guaranteed**. Even with true premises, the conclusion could still be false (e.g., if a cosmic event disrupted the Earth's rotation).
> 
> |Aspect|Deduction|Induction|
> |---|---|---|
> |Logical status|Valid (when properly formed)|Never valid (in strict logical terms)|
> |Certainty|Guaranteed if premises are true|Not guaranteed even with true premises|
> |Evaluation|Valid or invalid|Strong or weak|
> |Knowledge type|Explicates what is contained in premises|Extends beyond premises to new knowledge|
> 
> Inductive reasoning, while invaluable for science and everyday reasoning, always involves a "leap" beyond what is strictly entailed by the premises.

> [!idea] Statistical Syllogisms
> 
> Statistical syllogisms **draw conclusions about individuals based on their membership in a reference class with known statistical properties.**
> 
> Structure:
> 
> - Major premise: x% of F are G
> - Minor premise: a is F
> - Conclusion: Therefore, a is G with x% probability
> 
> Key Components:
> 
> - Reference Class (F): The group to which the individual belongs
> - Property (G): The characteristic being inferred
> - Probability (x%): The statistical frequency in the reference class

> [!example] Statistical Syllogisms
> 
> Medical Diagnosis Example:
> 
> - 80% of patients with symptoms X have condition Y
> - Patient A has symptoms X
> - Therefore, Patient A has an 80% probability of having condition Y
> 
> Student Performance:
> 
> - 90% of students who attend all lectures pass the course
> - Sarah attends all lectures
> - Therefore, Sarah has a 90% probability of passing the course
> 
> |Component|Example 1|Example 2|
> |---|---|---|
> |Reference Class|Patients with symptoms X|Students attending all lectures|
> |Property|Having condition Y|Passing the course|
> |Probability|80%|90%|
