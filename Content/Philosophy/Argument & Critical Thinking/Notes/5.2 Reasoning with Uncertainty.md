> [!motivation] Reasoning with Uncertainty
> 
> The world rarely presents us with absolute certainties. While deductive reasoning gives us concrete, definitive conclusions, most real-world situations involve incomplete information and varying degrees of confidence.
> 
> Consider these everyday scenarios:
> 
> - Weather forecasting uses probabilities rather than certainties
> - Medical diagnoses often involve weighing multiple possible conditions
> - Investment decisions account for various market uncertainties
> 
> Deductive reasoning, where conclusions follow necessarily from premises, represents only a small fraction of human reasoning. **Most reasoning involves drawing plausible but uncertain conclusions from available evidence.**

> [!idea] Induction
> 
> Induction is a **form of inference that draws general conclusions from specific observations or instances.** It *infers* a claim from an *imperfect* generalization. 
> 
> - Moves from specific cases to general principles
> - Generates probable rather than certain conclusions
> - Strengthens with additional supporting evidence
> 
> Structure of inductive reasoning:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Observations|Specific instances|"The sun has risen every day in recorded history"|
> |Pattern recognition|Identifying regularities|"This forms a consistent pattern without exceptions"|
> |Generalization|Extending to unobserved cases|"The sun will rise tomorrow"|
> 
> Types of inductive reasoning:
> 
> - Generalization: from sample to population
> - Analogical: from similarities in known attributes to similarities in unknown attributes
> - Causal: from observed correlation to causal relationship

> [!example] Deduction vs. Induction: Validity and Strength
> 
> **Deductive Argument**: Reasoning from certainty
> 
> - Premise 1: All humans are mortal
> - Premise 2: Socrates is human
> - Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal
> 
> This deductive **argument is valid - the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.** If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true with absolute certainty.
> 
> **Inductive Argument**: Reasoning from uncertainty
> 
> - Observation 1: The sun has risen every morning for thousands of years
> - Observation 2: The laws of planetary motion have been consistent
> - Conclusion: The sun will rise tomorrow
> 
> This inductive argument is **not valid - despite strong evidence, the conclusion is not guaranteed**. Even with true premises, the conclusion could still be false (e.g., if a cosmic event disrupted the Earth's rotation).
> 
> |Aspect|Deduction|Induction|
> |---|---|---|
> |Logical status|Valid (when properly formed)|Never valid (in strict logical terms)|
> |Certainty|Guaranteed if premises are true|Not guaranteed even with true premises|
> |Evaluation|Valid or invalid|Strong or weak|
> |Knowledge type|Explicates what is contained in premises|Extends beyond premises to new knowledge|
> 
> Inductive reasoning, while invaluable for science and everyday reasoning, always involves a "leap" beyond what is strictly entailed by the premises.

> [!idea] Statistical Syllogisms
> 
> Statistical syllogisms **draw inductive conclusions about entities based on their membership in a reference class with known statistical properties.**
> 
> Structure:
> 
> - Major premise: x% of F are G
> - Minor premise: a is F
> - Conclusion: Therefore, a is G with x% probability
> 
> Key Components:
> 
> - Reference Class (F): The group to which the entity belongs
> - Property (G): The characteristic being inferred
> - Probability (x%): The statistical frequency in the reference class

> [!example] Statistical Syllogisms
> 
> Medical Diagnosis Example:
> 
> - 80% of patients with symptoms X have condition Y
> - Patient A has symptoms X
> - Therefore, Patient A has an 80% probability of having condition Y
> 
> Student Performance:
> 
> - 90% of students who attend all lectures pass the course
> - Sarah attends all lectures
> - Therefore, Sarah has a 90% probability of passing the course

> [!idea] Numerical Induction
> 
> Numerical induction **draws conclusions about an entire category based on observations of its members.**
> 
> Structure:
> 
> - Premises: Observations about members of a category
> - Pattern: The shared property among observed members
> - Conclusion: Generalization to the entire category
> 

> [!example] Numerical Induction
> 
> Natural Numbers:
> 
> - Observed: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are all even numbers divisible by 2
> - Category: All even numbers
> - Conclusion: Therefore, all even numbers are divisible by 2
> 
> Prime Numbers:
> 
> |Observed Prime|Odd/Even|
> |---|---|
> |2|Even|
> |3|Odd|
> |5|Odd|
> |7|Odd|
> |11|Odd|
> |Conclusion|All primes except 2 are odd|

> [!consider] Statistical Syllogism vs Numerical Induction
> 
> Statistical Syllogism:
> 
> - Reasons from category to individual entity
> - Uses known statistical frequency (probability)
> - Conclusion applies to a single case
> 
> Numerical Induction:
> 
> - Reasons from individual cases to entire category
> - Doesn't use probabilities
> - Conclusion claims something about ALL members
> 
> Examples contrasting the same scenario:
> 
> |Statistical Syllogism|Numerical Induction|
> |---|---|
> |90% of primes are odd|We've seen many primes (3,5,7,11...) are odd|
> |13 is prime|-|
> |Therefore, 13 has 90% chance of being odd|Therefore, all primes (except 2) are odd|

> [!idea] Argument from Analogy
> 
> Argument from analogy **draws conclusions by comparing similar properties between two entities or situations.**
> 
> Structure:
> 
> - Entity A has properties p, q, r
> - Entity B shares properties p, q
> - Therefore, B likely has property r
> 

> [!example] Argument from Analogy
> 
> Planetary Comparison:
> 
> - Mars has atmosphere, solid surface, and water
> - Earth has atmosphere, solid surface, water, and life
> - Therefore, Mars might have life
> 
> Software Development:
> 
> |Known Project|New Project|
> |---|---|
> |Web app|Mobile app|
> |Used React|Uses React|
> |6 months dev time|?|
> |Conclusion|Likely 6 months|
> 
> Since the projects share similar technology and complexity, we infer similar development time.

> [!consider] Amplification in Induction
> 
> Inductive reasoning is ampliative because it **expands beyond the original information in the premises:**
> 
> |Type|Input|Output|Amplification|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Statistical Syllogism|Group property|Individual prediction|Extends group statistics to new cases|
> |Numerical Induction|Sample observations|Universal claim|Extends from some to all|
> |Argument from Analogy|Shared properties|New property|Extends similarity to unobserved features|
> 
> This amplification is what makes inductive reasoning both powerful and uncertain - we gain new knowledge, but conclusions are not guaranteed to be true even if premises are true.
