I sincerely apologize for continuing to misunderstand. Let me try to correctly interpret what you're asking:

You want me to write an original motivation callout about reasoning with uncertainty, and then include the exact idea and example callouts that you already provided in your instructions.

Here's my attempt:

> [!motivation] Reasoning with Uncertainty
> 
> In our daily lives, we rarely have complete information when making decisions. While deductive reasoning provides certainty when premises are true, such scenarios are uncommon. Most real-world reasoning involves probabilities rather than certainties - we assess weather patterns to predict rain, evaluate symptoms to diagnose illness, or analyze past market trends to make investments. Understanding how to reason effectively with incomplete information is essential for navigating an inherently uncertain world.

> [!idea] Induction
> 
> Induction is a **form of inference that draws general conclusions from specific observations or instances.**
> 
> - Moves from specific cases to general principles
> - Generates probable rather than certain conclusions
> - Strengthens with additional supporting evidence
> 
> Structure of inductive reasoning:
> 
> |Component|Function|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Observations|Specific instances|"The sun has risen every day in recorded history"|
> |Pattern recognition|Identifying regularities|"This forms a consistent pattern without exceptions"|
> |Generalization|Extending to unobserved cases|"The sun will rise tomorrow"|
> 
> Types of inductive reasoning:
> 
> - Generalization: from sample to population
> - Analogical: from similarities in known attributes to similarities in unknown attributes
> - Causal: from observed correlation to causal relationship

> [!example] Deduction vs. Induction: Validity and Strength
> 
> **Deductive Argument**: Reasoning from certainty
> 
> - Premise 1: All humans are mortal
> - Premise 2: Socrates is human
> - Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal
> 
> This deductive **argument is valid - the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.** If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true with absolute certainty.
> 
> **Inductive Argument**: Reasoning from uncertainty
> 
> - Observation 1: The sun has risen every morning for thousands of years
> - Observation 2: The laws of planetary motion have been consistent
> - Conclusion: The sun will rise tomorrow
> 
> This inductive argument is **not valid - despite strong evidence, the conclusion is not guaranteed**. Even with true premises, the conclusion could still be false (e.g., if a cosmic event disrupted the Earth's rotation).
> 
> |Aspect|Deduction|Induction|
> |---|---|---|
> |Logical status|Valid (when properly formed)|Never valid (in strict logical terms)|
> |Certainty|Guaranteed if premises are true|Not guaranteed even with true premises|
> |Evaluation|Valid or invalid|Strong or weak|
> |Knowledge type|Explicates what is contained in premises|Extends beyond premises to new knowledge|
> 
> Inductive reasoning, while invaluable for science and everyday reasoning, always involves a "leap" beyond what is strictly entailed by the premises.
