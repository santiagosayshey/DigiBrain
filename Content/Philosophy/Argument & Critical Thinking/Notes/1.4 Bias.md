> [!motivation] The Pursuit of Objectivity
> 
> Cognitive processing inherently filters information through individual perspectives. This natural tendency can create distortions in judgment and decision-making. When seeking to make evidence-based decisions or conduct rigorous analysis, these distortions interfere with accurate evaluation of information. The need to identify and mitigate these distortions becomes essential for reliable reasoning.

> [!idea] Bias
> 
> Bias refers to **systematic errors in thinking that influence decisions and judgments**. It represents deviations from standard norms of rationality or from accurate information processing.
> 
> - Acts as a cognitive shortcut that can lead to distorted perceptions
> - Operates through selective attention, memory, and interpretation of information
> - Creates predictable patterns of deviation from objective evaluation
> 
> Biases can manifest in individual cognition, social interactions, and institutional structures, affecting everything from personal decisions to scientific research.

> [!idea] Conscious vs. Unconscious Bias
> 
> Biases operate at different levels of awareness, affecting decision-making through both deliberate and automatic processes.
> 
> - **Conscious bias**: Explicit attitudes and beliefs that individuals are aware of and can articulate
> - **Unconscious bias**: Implicit attitudes that operate outside conscious awareness but influence judgments
> 
> |Type|Awareness|Operation|Mitigation Approach|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Conscious|Individual is aware|Deliberate, controlled|Direct confrontation and reasoning|
> |Unconscious|Below awareness threshold|Automatic, unintentional|Exposure to counter-stereotypical information, structured decision protocols|

> [!example] Manifestations of Bias Types
> 
> **Conscious Bias Example** An employer explicitly favors candidates from specific universities based on personal preference, despite evidence that performance isn't correlated with institution attended.
> 
> **Unconscious Bias Example** In a study evaluating identical resumes, researchers found that resumes with traditionally male names received more interview offers and higher starting salary proposals than identical resumes with traditionally female names.
> 
> |Domain|Conscious Bias|Unconscious Bias|
> |---|---|---|
> |Hiring|Explicitly stating preference for younger candidates|Consistently rating younger candidates as "more energetic" without recognizing pattern|
> |Medical|Deliberately prescribing different treatments based on patient demographics|Spending less time with certain patient groups without awareness|
> |Academia|Intentionally citing only researchers from prestigious institutions|Perceiving research from certain countries as less rigorous without conscious evaluation|

| What unconscious biases do you most often see in the people around you? Might any of these also affect your own judgement | Racism. Automatically feeling threatened by a group of people, or expecting them to doing something based on what they look like - drive badly, start a fight, steal. Smell bad. etc |

> [!consider] Fast and Slow Thinking
> 
> Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory distinguishes between two modes of thinking that influence judgment and decision-making.
> 
> - **System 1 (Fast)**: Operates automatically, quickly, with minimal effort and no voluntary control
>     - Relies on heuristics, intuition, and pattern recognition
>     - Prone to systematic errors when faced with uncertainty
>     - Enables rapid responses but vulnerable to biases
> - **System 2 (Slow)**: Allocates attention to effortful mental activities that demand concentration
>     - Engages in deliberate reasoning, calculation, and analysis
>     - Capable of monitoring and sometimes correcting System 1 errors
>     - Limited by cognitive resources and often "lazy"
> 
> **"What You See Is All There Is" (WYSIATI)**: A key concept explaining how System 1 constructs coherent interpretations from limited available information.
> 
> - Creates illusion of understanding based solely on accessible evidence
> - Ignores unknown information, leading to overconfidence in judgments
> - Facilitates premature conclusions without considering missing data
> - Explains why different people can draw entirely different conclusions from the same limited evidence

> [!idea] Survivorship Bias
> 
> Survivorship bias is the logical error of focusing exclusively on people or things that "survived" a selection process while overlooking those that did not.
> 
> - Creates distorted understanding by examining only visible successes
> - Leads to false conclusions about causality and performance
> - Obscures the true factors determining outcomes
> 
> **Classic example**: During WWII, statistician Abraham Wald studied returning damaged aircraft to determine where to add armor. Rather than reinforcing the areas showing damage, he recommended protecting the areas showing no damageâ€”reasoning that planes hit in those areas never returned.
> 
> **Modern manifestations**:
> 
> - Studying only successful entrepreneurs while ignoring failed ventures
> - Examining investment strategies that performed well without considering those that collapsed
> - Focusing on lasting institutions without analyzing those that disappeared

> [!idea] Confirmation Bias
> 
> Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses.
> 
> - Selectively collects evidence supporting existing views while dismissing contradictory information
> - Creates self-reinforcing patterns of belief that resist correction
> - Operates through three primary mechanisms:
>     1. Biased information search (seeking confirming evidence)
>     2. Biased interpretation (interpreting ambiguous evidence as supportive)
>     3. Biased memory (better recall of confirming information)
> 
> **Real-world impact**:
> 
> - Scientific research: Tendency to design studies that support hypotheses
> - Medical diagnosis: Fixating on initial impressions despite contradictory evidence
> - Political discourse: Consuming media that reinforces existing views
> - Interpersonal relationships: Noticing behaviors that align with first impressions
> 
> Mitigation requires deliberate exposure to diverse viewpoints, active consideration of alternative hypotheses, and structured decision-making processes that account for cognitive limitations.
