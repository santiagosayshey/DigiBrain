> [!idea] Reasons
> 
> Reasons are justifications we provide for our actions, beliefs, or decisions.
> 
> - We use reasons to justify or explain our own behavior
> - We evaluate others' actions based on their stated reasons
> - We use reasons to convince others of our position
> 
> Reasons can be:
> 
> - **Retrospective**: explaining past actions ("I was late because my car broke down")
> - **Prospective**: justifying future actions ("I'm saving money because I want to buy a house")

> [!idea] Arguments
> 
> An argument occurs when we **reason to claim or conclude something based on supporting premises.**
> 
> - Arguments aim to persuade others of a conclusion
> - Arguments differ from assertions, which are claims made without supporting reasons
> - The quality of an argument depends on how well the premises support the conclusion

> [!example] Structure of an Argument
> 
> ```
> It is wrong to keep animals as pets, because this means they are not free and cannot lead dignified lives. All living creatures deserve the dignity of freedom.
> ```
> 
> In this argument:
> 
> - **Conclusion**: "It is wrong to keep animals as pets"
> - **Premises**:
>     1. Pets are not free
>     2. Pets cannot lead dignified lives
>     3. All living creatures deserve the dignity of freedom

> [!consider] Support in Arguments
> 
> A proper argument requires premises that support a conclusion.
> 
> - The support relationship is what makes an argument valid, not necessarily the persuasiveness of the premises
> - Premises may be:
>     - True or false
>     - Strong or weak
>     - Relevant or irrelevant
> 
> Even when premises are weak, if they are intended to support a conclusion, they still constitute an argument.
