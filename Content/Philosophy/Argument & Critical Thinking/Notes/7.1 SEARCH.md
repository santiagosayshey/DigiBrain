> [!motivation] Evaluating Explanations
> We often encounter situations with multiple potential explanations for an observation or event.
> Selecting the most plausible explanation requires a structured approach.
> Without a method, evaluations can be inconsistent or biased.

> [!idea] The SEARCH Method
> SEARCH provides a systematic framework for evaluating explanations or hypotheses. It involves several distinct steps:
> - **S**tate the claim or hypothesis clearly.
> - **E**xamine the **E**vidence relevant to the claim.
> - Consider **A**lternative hypotheses that could also explain the evidence.
> - **R**ate each **H**ypothesis based on the **C**riteria of **A**dequacy.
>
> This method helps ensure a thorough and comparative assessment of different explanations. Note the anagram formed by the key steps.

> [!consider] Criteria of Adequacy
> The final step of SEARCH involves rating hypotheses using criteria of adequacy.
> These criteria determine what makes an explanation strong or weak.
> The specific criteria, such as testability, scope, simplicity (Ockham's Razor), conservatism, mechanism, and predictive power, are detailed in [[6.2 Evaluation]].
> These criteria provide the standards against which alternative hypotheses are compared in the SEARCH process.

> [!example] SEARCH in Action: The Wilting Plant
> Imagine finding a wilting houseplant. Let's apply SEARCH:
>
> 1.  **State Claim (Hypothesis 1)**: The plant is wilting due to underwatering.
> 2.  **Examine Evidence**:
>     - *For H1*: Soil is dry to the touch; leaves are drooping.
>     - *Against H1*: Plant was watered two days ago.
> 3.  **Alternative Hypotheses**:
>     - *H2*: Root rot from overwatering. Evidence: Soil surface is dry, but deeper soil might be waterlogged; fungus gnats present.
>     - *H3*: Pest infestation (e.g., spider mites). Evidence: Fine webs visible on close inspection; leaves have tiny spots.
> 4.  **Rate Hypotheses (using Criteria from [[6.2 Evaluation]])**:
>     - *H1 (Underwatering)*: Simple, testable. Consistent with dry surface soil but less so with recent watering.
>     - *H2 (Overwatering/Root Rot)*: Testable, plausible mechanism. Explains wilting despite recent watering; accounts for gnats. Requires checking deeper soil.
>     - *H3 (Pests)*: Testable, plausible mechanism. Explains spots and webs. Consistent with wilting.
>
> Based on this evaluation, H2 or H3 might be considered stronger candidates than H1, prompting further investigation (checking root moisture, examining leaves closely).
