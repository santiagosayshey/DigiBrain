> [!motivation] Evaluating Explanations
> We often encounter situations with multiple potential explanations for the same observation or event. Selecting the most plausible one requires a structured approach to ensure evaluations are consistent and avoid bias.

> [!idea] The SEARCH Method
> SEARCH provides a systematic framework for evaluating competing explanations or hypotheses. It guides the user through several key steps, forming an acronym:
> - **S**tate the claim or hypothesis clearly and precisely.
> - Examine the **E**vidence relevant to the claim (both for and against).
> - Consider **A**lternative hypotheses that could also plausibly explain the evidence.
> - **R**ate the alternatives by applying the **C**riteria of adequacy to each **H**ypothesis.
>
> This structured process facilitates a thorough and comparative assessment of different explanations.

> [!consider] Criteria of Adequacy
> The final step of SEARCH involves rating hypotheses using criteria of adequacy. These criteria, which determine the qualities of a strong explanation (like testability, scope, simplicity, etc.), provide the objective standards for comparing hypotheses within the framework. The specific details and examples of these criteria are covered comprehensively in the linked note [[6.2 Evaluation]].

> [!example] SEARCH in Action: The Wilting Plant
> Let's apply SEARCH to determine why a houseplant is wilting:
>
> 1.  **State Claim (Hypothesis 1)**: The primary hypothesis is that the plant is wilting due to underwatering.
> 2.  **Examine Evidence**:
>     - *Supporting H1*: The surface soil feels dry; the leaves are visibly drooping.
>     - *Conflicting with H1*: Records show the plant was watered just two days ago.
> 3.  **Alternative Hypotheses**:
>     - *H2*: Root rot resulting from previous overwatering. Evidence could include persistently damp deeper soil or the presence of fungus gnats.
>     - *H3*: Pest infestation, like spider mites. Evidence might be fine webbing between leaves or tiny spots on the foliage upon close inspection.
> 4.  **Rate Hypotheses using Criteria (from [[6.2 Evaluation]])**:
>     - *H1 (Underwatering)*: Simple and testable. Fits surface dryness but conflicts with recent watering. Scope might be limited if other symptoms exist.
>     - *H2 (Overwatering/Root Rot)*: Testable, provides a plausible mechanism. Could explain wilting despite recent watering. Predicts damp sub-surface soil.
>     - *H3 (Pests)*: Testable, mechanism clear. Explains wilting and potentially other signs like spots/webs. Scope covers visible symptoms.
>
> *Evaluation*: Based on the initial evidence and how well the hypotheses meet criteria like consistency and explanatory scope, H2 and H3 appear as strong or stronger candidates than H1. Further investigation (checking roots, inspecting leaves closely) is needed, guided by the evaluation. This illustrates how SEARCH structures the investigation process.

> [!consider] Evaluating the Evaluation Criteria
> Why use multiple criteria (like those in [[6.2 Evaluation]]) to assess explanations, and are they equally important?
>
> - **Multiple Facets of Quality**: Explanations have different strengths. One might be simple, another might explain more phenomena, while a third makes novel predictions. Using multiple criteria ensures a more holistic and robust assessment than relying on a single measure.
> - **Context-Dependent Importance**: The criteria are generally *not* considered equally important across all situations.
>     - *Testability* is often seen as a fundamental requirement for scientific claims.
>     - *Predictive Power* and *Explanatory Scope* are frequently highly valued as indicators of a theory's strength and utility.
>     - *Simplicity* (Ockham's Razor) and *Conservatism* can act as useful guides or tie-breakers, but might be overridden if a more complex or radical theory demonstrates significantly better performance on other criteria.
> - **Trade-offs**: Often, improving an explanation based on one criterion might weaken it on another (e.g., increasing scope might require added complexity). The relative weighting depends on the specific scientific context and goals.

> [!example] Criteria in Action: Geocentric vs. Heliocentric Models
> The historical shift from the Earth-centered (Ptolemaic) to the Sun-centered (Copernican/Keplerian) model of the solar system illustrates how these criteria are applied and weighted over time:
>
> | Criterion          | Geocentric (Ptolemaic) Model                       | Heliocentric (Copernican/Keplerian) Model              | Outcome Comparison                                                                 |
> | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | **Conservatism** | High (aligned with existing physics/observation)   | Low initially (contradicted established ideas)         | Geocentric initially favoured; Heliocentric required abandoning old assumptions. |
> | **Simplicity** | Low (required complex epicycles, deferents)        | High (simpler core concept, fewer arbitrary additions) | Heliocentric seen as more elegant, especially with Kepler's ellipses.            |
> | **Scope** | Explained planetary positions, moon phases         | Explained these + retrograde motion, phases of Venus   | Heliocentric explained a broader range of phenomena more naturally.                 |
> | **Predictive Power** | Adequate for centuries, but needed adjustments    | Initially similar, later superior (Kepler/Galileo)     | Heliocentric's ability to predict new observations (Venus phases) was key.       |
> | **Mechanism** | Complex, somewhat contrived celestial spheres     | More unified physical basis (gravity, eventually)      | Heliocentric model paved the way for a physical mechanism (Newtonian gravity). |
>
> Initially, conservatism favoured the geocentric model. However, the heliocentric model eventually gained acceptance due to its superior simplicity, broader explanatory scope, and increased predictive power, demonstrating how these criteria can outweigh initial conservatism in scientific revolutions.
