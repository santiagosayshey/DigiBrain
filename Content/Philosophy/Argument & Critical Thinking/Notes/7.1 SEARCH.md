> [!motivation] Evaluating Explanations
> We often encounter situations with multiple potential explanations for the same observation or event. Selecting the most plausible one requires a structured approach to ensure evaluations are consistent and avoid bias.

> [!idea] The SEARCH Method
> SEARCH provides a systematic framework for evaluating competing explanations or hypotheses. It guides the user through several key steps, forming an acronym:
> - **S**tate the claim or hypothesis clearly and precisely.
> - Examine the **E**vidence relevant to the claim (both for and against).
> - Consider **A**lternative hypotheses that could also plausibly explain the evidence.
> - **R**ate the alternatives by applying the **C**riteria of adequacy to each **H**ypothesis.
>
> This structured process facilitates a thorough and comparative assessment of different explanations.

> [!consider] Criteria of Adequacy
> The final step of SEARCH involves rating hypotheses using criteria of adequacy. These criteria, which determine the qualities of a strong explanation (like testability, scope, simplicity, etc.), provide the objective standards for comparing hypotheses within the framework. The specific details and examples of these criteria are covered comprehensively in the linked note [[6.2 Evaluation]].

> [!example] SEARCH in Action: The Wilting Plant
> Let's apply SEARCH to determine why a houseplant is wilting:
>
> 1.  **State Claim (Hypothesis 1)**: The primary hypothesis is that the plant is wilting due to underwatering.
> 2.  **Examine Evidence**:
>     - *Supporting H1*: The surface soil feels dry; the leaves are visibly drooping.
>     - *Conflicting with H1*: Records show the plant was watered just two days ago.
> 3.  **Alternative Hypotheses**:
>     - *H2*: Root rot resulting from previous overwatering. Evidence could include persistently damp deeper soil or the presence of fungus gnats.
>     - *H3*: Pest infestation, like spider mites. Evidence might be fine webbing between leaves or tiny spots on the foliage upon close inspection.
> 4.  **Rate Hypotheses using Criteria (from [[6.2 Evaluation]])**:
>     - *H1 (Underwatering)*: Simple and testable. Fits surface dryness but conflicts with recent watering. Scope might be limited if other symptoms exist.
>     - *H2 (Overwatering/Root Rot)*: Testable, provides a plausible mechanism. Could explain wilting despite recent watering. Predicts damp sub-surface soil.
>     - *H3 (Pests)*: Testable, mechanism clear. Explains wilting and potentially other signs like spots/webs. Scope covers visible symptoms.
>
> *Evaluation*: Based on the initial evidence and how well the hypotheses meet criteria like consistency and explanatory scope, H2 and H3 appear as strong or stronger candidates than H1. Further investigation (checking roots, inspecting leaves closely) is needed, guided by the evaluation. This illustrates how SEARCH structures the investigation process.
