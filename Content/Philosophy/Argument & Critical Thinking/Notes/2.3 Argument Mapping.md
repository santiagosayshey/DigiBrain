> [!motivation] Argument Mapping
> 
> Arguments in natural language are often unclear, convoluted, and difficult to analyze. Written and spoken arguments frequently:
> 
> - Mix premises and conclusions without clear organization
> - Contain implicit assumptions not explicitly stated
> - Include irrelevant information that obscures the logical structure
> - Present complex relationships between multiple claims
> 
> These issues make it challenging to evaluate the strength and validity of arguments, identify flaws in reasoning, and communicate complex arguments effectively.

> [!idea] Argument Map Structure
> 
> Argument maps are visual representations that display the logical structure of arguments using boxes and arrows.
> 
> **Core Components:**
> 
> - **Conclusion/Claim**: The main point being argued for (typically at the top of the map)
> - **Premises**: Statements offered as support for a conclusion
> - **Inferential relationships**: Connections between premises and conclusions
> 
> |Component|Visual Representation|Function|
> |---|---|---|
> |Conclusion|Box (often at top)|States what is being argued for|
> |Premise|Box (below conclusions)|Provides support for conclusions|
> |Inference|Arrow pointing upward|Shows supporting relationship|

> [!idea] Premise Types
> 
> **Independent Premises**: Provide support for a conclusion on their own
> 
> - Each can stand alone as support
> - Indicated by separate arrows leading to the conclusion
> 
> **Joint/Co-Premises**: Multiple premises that work together to support a conclusion
> 
> - Must be considered collectively to provide support
> - Often linked with brackets or grouped arrows
> - None of the premises provides adequate support individually

> [!idea] Advanced Argument Elements
> 
> **Sub-conclusions**: Claims that serve as both:
> 
> - Conclusions supported by lower-level premises
> - Premises supporting higher-level conclusions
> 
> **Objections**: Counter-arguments or potential problems with a claim
> 
> - Often displayed in contrasting colors or with different arrow types
> - Can target premises or conclusions
> 
> **Rebuttals**: Responses to objections that defend the original argument
> 
> - Connect to objections, often shown with distinctive formatting
 
> [!example] Building an Argument Map
> 
> Let's analyze this argument:
> 
> "Education should be free for all citizens because it benefits society as a whole. When people are educated, they contribute more to the economy. Additionally, education is a basic human right."
> 
> **Step 1: Find and number all statements in order**
> 
> 1. Education should be free for all citizens
> 2. It (education) benefits society as a whole
> 3. When people are educated, they contribute more to the economy
> 4. Education is a basic human right
> 
> **Step 2: Identify premises and conclusion**
> 
> - Conclusion: Statement 1 (Education should be free for all citizens)
> - Premises: Statements 2, 3, and 4
> - Indicators: "because" signals that what follows is a premise
> 
> **Step 3: Draw the argument map**
> 
> ```
>                        1. Education should be
>                           free for all citizens
>                                   ↑
>                       ┌───────────┼───────────┐
>                       │           │           │
> 2. Education benefits │    3. Educated people    4. Education is a

>                                to the economy
