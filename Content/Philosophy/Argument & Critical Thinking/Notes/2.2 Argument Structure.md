> [!idea] Sentences
> 
> In arguments, not all sentences can serve as premises or conclusions.
> 
> - Some sentences pose questions ("Have you seen Interstellar?")
> - Some express commands or recommendations ("You should see Interstellar!")
> - Some convey emotions or exclamations
> 
> To **function as premises or conclusions in arguments, sentences must be capable of being true or false.**

> [!idea] Statements
> 
> Statements are sentences that can be either true or false.
> 
> - Only statements can serve as premises or conclusions in arguments
> - Examples of statements:
>     - "The film Interstellar was released in 2014"
>     - "The Earth orbits the Sun"
> 
> |Type of Sentence|Can Be Premise/Conclusion|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Question|No|"Is it raining?"|
> |Command|No|"Close the window!"|
> |Statement|Yes|"The window is closed."|

> [!example] Identifying Statements vs. Non-Statements
> 
> ```
> 1. Have you seen "Interstellar"? (Question - not a statement)
> 2. You really should see "Interstellar"! (Command/recommendation - not a statement)
> 3. "Interstellar" was directed by Christopher Nolan. (Statement - can be true/false)
> 4. What are these? (Question - not a statement)
> 5. The runtime of "Interstellar" is 169 minutes. (Statement - can be true/false)
> ```

> [!idea] Premises
> 
> Premises are statements that provide support or reasons for a conclusion in an argument.
> 
> - Premise indicators are words or phrases that signal a statement is being used as support
> - Common premise indicators:
>     - Because
>     - Since
>     - Given that
>     - As indicated by
>     - The reason is
>     - For
>     - As shown by
> 
> These indicators typically appear before the premise in an argument.

> [!idea] Conclusions
> 
> Conclusions are statements that are supported by premises in an argument.
> 
> - Conclusion indicators are words or phrases that signal a statement is the main point being argued for
> - Common conclusion indicators:
>     - Therefore
>     - Thus
>     - Hence
>     - So
>     - Consequently
>     - It follows that
>     - As a result
>     - This shows that
> 
> These indicators typically appear before the conclusion statement.

> [!example] Identifying Premises and Conclusions
> 
> ```
> "Since pets are not free to roam as they would in nature, and all living creatures deserve the dignity of freedom, therefore it is wrong to keep animals as pets."
> 
> Premise indicators: "Since"
> Premises:
> - Pets are not free to roam as they would in nature
> - All living creatures deserve the dignity of freedom
> 
> Conclusion indicator: "therefore"
> Conclusion: It is wrong to keep animals as pets
> ```

> [!consider] Implicit Components
> 
> Arguments sometimes have implicit (unstated) premises or conclusions.
> 
> - Implicit premises are assumptions the arguer expects the audience to accept
> - Implicit conclusions must be inferred from the premises provided
> - Identifying these unstated components often requires careful analysis
> 
> Even without explicit indicators, the logical structure of an argument can usually be discerned by asking: "What is being supported?" and "What is doing the supporting?"
