> [!motivation] The Pursuit of Objectivity
> 
> Cognitive processing inherently filters information through individual perspectives. This natural tendency can create distortions in judgment and decision-making. When seeking to make evidence-based decisions or conduct rigorous analysis, these distortions interfere with accurate evaluation of information. The need to identify and mitigate these distortions becomes essential for reliable reasoning.

> [!idea] Bias
> 
> Bias refers to **systematic errors in thinking that influence decisions and judgments**. It represents deviations from standard norms of rationality or from accurate information processing.
> 
> - Acts as a cognitive shortcut that can lead to distorted perceptions
> - Operates through selective attention, memory, and interpretation of information
> - Creates predictable patterns of deviation from objective evaluation
> 
> Biases can manifest in individual cognition, social interactions, and institutional structures, affecting everything from personal decisions to scientific research.

> [!idea] Conscious vs. Unconscious Bias
> 
> Biases operate at different levels of awareness, affecting decision-making through both deliberate and automatic processes.
> 
> - **Conscious bias**: Explicit attitudes and beliefs that individuals are aware of and can articulate
> - **Unconscious bias**: Implicit attitudes that operate outside conscious awareness but influence judgments
> 
> |Type|Awareness|Operation|Mitigation Approach|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Conscious|Individual is aware|Deliberate, controlled|Direct confrontation and reasoning|
> |Unconscious|Below awareness threshold|Automatic, unintentional|Exposure to counter-stereotypical information, structured decision protocols|

> [!example] Manifestations of Bias Types
> 
> **Conscious Bias Example** An employer explicitly favors candidates from specific universities based on personal preference, despite evidence that performance isn't correlated with institution attended.
> 
> **Unconscious Bias Example** In a study evaluating identical resumes, researchers found that resumes with traditionally male names received more interview offers and higher starting salary proposals than identical resumes with traditionally female names.
> 
> |Domain|Conscious Bias|Unconscious Bias|
> |---|---|---|
> |Hiring|Explicitly stating preference for younger candidates|Consistently rating younger candidates as "more energetic" without recognizing pattern|
> |Medical|Deliberately prescribing different treatments based on patient demographics|Spending less time with certain patient groups without awareness|
> |Academia|Intentionally citing only researchers from prestigious institutions|Perceiving research from certain countries as less rigorous without conscious evaluation|

| What unconscious biases do you most often see in the people around you? Might any of these also affect your own judgement | Racism. Automatically feeling threatened by a group of people, or expecting them to doing somet |
