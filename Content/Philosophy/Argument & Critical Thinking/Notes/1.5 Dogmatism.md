> [!motivation] The Opposite of Critical Thinking
> 
> Critical thinking involves questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and remaining open to revision. Without this approach, knowledge becomes static and resistant to improvement.
> 
> - Information constantly evolves as new discoveries emerge
> - Intellectual growth requires willingness to reconsider existing beliefs
> - Rigid adherence to ideas prevents adaptation to changing circumstances
> 
> When beliefs become fixed regardless of contrary evidence, reasoning becomes circular and self-reinforcing, creating barriers to learning and understanding.

> [!idea] Dogmatism
> 
> Dogmatism refers to the **tendency to hold views as incontrovertibly true despite evidence to the contrary.**
> 
> - Characterized by assertion of opinions as facts without supporting evidence
> - Involves inflexible adherence to principles or doctrines
> - Creates resistance to revision even when confronted with contradictory information
> 
> **Psychological components:**
> 
> - Cognitive closure: preference for certainty over ambiguity
> - Authority reliance: accepting claims based on source rather than merit
> - Confirmation bias: selectively attending to supporting evidence
> 
> **Manifestations:**
> 
> |Domain|Manifestation|
> |---|---|
> |Science|Rejecting new data that challenges established theories|
> |Politics|Unwillingness to consider opposing viewpoints|
> |Religion|Literal interpretation of texts regardless of context|
> |Education|Rote memorization without questioning underlying principles|

> [!example] Dogmatism in Action
> 
> **Historical Example:** In the 17th century, the Catholic Church rejected Galileo's heliocentric model despite telescopic evidence, adhering to the geocentric worldview as doctrine.
> 
> **Modern Examples:**
> 
> - A researcher dismisses contradictory findings without examination because they conflict with their published work
> - A person rejects all statistical evidence about climate change because it contradicts their political identity
> - A student insists a calculation is correct despite arriving at an impossible result
> 
> **Conversation Patterns:**
> 
> - "That's just how it is"
> - "I don't need evidence, I know I'm right"
> - "This source/expert cannot be questioned"
> - Changing the subject when presented with conflicting information

> [!consider] Allocating Your Attention
> 
> The phrase "pay attention" reveals attention as a limited cognitive resource that requires deliberate allocation.
> 
> - Focused attention demands mental effort and cannot be sustained indefinitely
> - Environments significantly impact attention quality (libraries vs. personal spaces)
> - Distraction, particularly from technology, represents the primary obstacle to sustained focus
> 
> **Strategic approaches:**
> 
> - Pre-determining which materials deserve deep vs. superficial engagement
> - Creating physical and digital environments conducive to concentration
> - Developing habits that protect attention rather than relying on willpower
> 
> Effective thinking requires not just the ability to focus but also the wisdom to decide what deserves our limited cognitive resources in the first place.
