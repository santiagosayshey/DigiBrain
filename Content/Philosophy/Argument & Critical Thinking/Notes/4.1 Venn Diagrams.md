> [!motivation] Issues with Analogous Form
> 
> When analyzing arguments, we often need to determine their validity. The analogous form technique can be problematic because a single counterexample can disprove an entire argument structure.
> 
> For example:
> 
> - All A are B
> - All C are B
> - Therefore, All A are C
> 
> This form appears logical but is actually invalid, as we'll see when we represent it visually.

> [!idea] Venn Diagrams
> 
> Venn diagrams provide a **visual representation of classes, categorical statements, and the arguments built from such statements.**
> 
> - Enable visualization of logical relationships between sets
> - Show validity/invalidity of categorical arguments
> - Illustrate inclusion, exclusion, and overlap of classes

> [!idea] Classes
> 
> Classes are **groups of things where individual items are called members.**
> 
> - A class can be defined by a common property (e.g., mammals)
> - Members are individuals that belong to the class
> - Classes may be finite (US states) or infinite (even numbers)

> [!consider] Theoretical Classes
> 
> Classes don't necessarily need to contain things that actually exist. They just need to convey things that we can imagine existing.
> 
> - Fictional entities like unicorns or superheroes can form valid classes
> - Empty classes (e.g., "present kings of France") are logically meaningful
> - Hypothetical classes help explore logical relationships without requiring physical existence

> [!example] Representing Classes
> 
> Venn diagrams start with the universe (everything that exists) represented by a rectangle. Inside this universe, we place circles to represent specific classes.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20250325193650.png|500]]
> 
> In the diagram above:
> 
> - The rectangle represents the universe containing everything
> - The left circle represents the class of all cats
> - The right circle represents the class of all gods
> - The overlapping region represents entities that are both cats and gods
> - The area inside the rectangle but outside both circles represents things that are neither cats nor gods

> [!idea] Markings
> 
> Venn diagrams use specific marking conventions to **indicate information about class contents:**
> 
> - **Shading**: Indicates an empty set or region (contains no members)
>     - Used to show exclusion relationships like "No S are P"
>     - Helps visualize universal negative statements
> - **X mark**: Indicates a region contains at least one member
>     - Used to show existence relationships like "Some S are P"
>     - Helps visualize particular affirmative statements
> - **White/unmarked**: Indicates insufficient information about that region
>     - Neither confirms nor denies the existence of members
>     - Represents areas where no specific claim has been made

> [!idea] Venn Diagrams and Categorical Forms
> 
> Venn diagrams provide visual representations of the four standard categorical statement forms (A, E, I, O):
> 
> **A: Universal Affirmative** - "All S are P"
> 
> - Represented by shading the region that is S but not P
> - Example: "All dolphins are mammals"
> ![[Pasted image 20250325220820.png]]
> 
> **E: Universal Negative** - "No S are P"
> 
> - Represented by shading the entire overlapping region between S and P
> - Example: "No reptiles are mammals"
> ![[Pasted image 20250325220837.png]]
> 
> **I: Particular Affirmative** - "Some S are P"
> 
> - Represented by placing an X in the overlapping region between S and P
> - Example: "Some birds are predators"
> - _[Space for diagram]_
> 
> **O: Particular Negative** - "Some S are not P"
> 
> - Represented by placing an X in the region that is S but not P
> - Example: "Some mammals are not aquatic"
> - _[Space for diagram]_
> 
> These visual representations help evaluate argument validity by showing relationships between classes.
