> [!motivation] Issues with Analogous Form
> 
> When analyzing arguments, we often need to determine their validity. The analogous form technique can be problematic because a single counterexample can disprove an entire argument structure.
> 
> For example:
> 
> - All A are B
> - All C are B
> - Therefore, All A are C
> 
> This form appears logical but is actually invalid, as we'll see when we represent it visually.

> [!idea] Venn Diagrams
> 
> Venn diagrams provide a **visual representation of classes, categorical statements, and the arguments built from such statements.**
> 
> - Enable visualization of logical relationships between sets
> - Show validity/invalidity of categorical arguments
> - Illustrate inclusion, exclusion, and overlap of classes

> [!idea] Classes
> 
> Classes are **groups of things where individual items are called members.**
> 
> - A class can be defined by a common property (e.g., mammals)
> - Members are individuals that belong to the class
> - Classes may be finite (US states) or infinite (even numbers)

> [!example] Subject and Predicate Terms
> 
> In categorical statements, subject and predicate terms represent classes:
> 
> |Statement Type|Form|Example|Class Relationship|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Universal Affirmative|All S are P|All cats are mammals|Cat class is contained within mammal class|
> |Universal Negative|No S are P|No fish are mammals|Fish class has no overlap with mammal class|
> |Particular Affirmative|Some S are P|Some animals are cats|Animal class partially overlaps with cat class|
> |Particular Negative|Some S are not P|Some mammals are not cats|Mammal class not entirely contained in cat class|

> [!consider] Theoretical Classes
> 
> Classes don't necessarily need to contain things that actually exist. They just need to convey things that we can imagine existing.
> 
> - Fictional entities like unicorns or superheroes can form valid classes
> - Empty classes (e.g., "present kings of France") are logically meaningful
> - Hypothetical classes help explore logical relationships without requiring physical existence

> [!example] Representing Classes
> 
> Venn diagrams start with the universe (everything that exists) represented by a rectangle. Inside this universe, we place circles to represent specific classes.

> 
> In the diagram above:
> 
> - The rectangle represents the universe containing everything
> - The left circle represents the class of all cats
> - The right circle represents the class of all gods
> - The overlapping region represents entities that are both cats and gods
> - The area inside the rectangle but outside both circles represents things that are neither cats nor gods

> [!consider] Cat Gods in Mythology
> 
> While our Venn diagram shows an overlap between cats and gods, this intersection isn't merely theoretical!
> 
> - Ancient Egypt venerated Bastet, a goddess often depicted with a cat's head
> - The Norse goddess Freyja rode a chariot pulled by cats
> - In Japanese folklore, the Bakeneko are supernatural cat beings with godlike powers
> - Modern internet culture has playfully elevated cats to "god-tier" status
> 
> This intersection reminds us that classification systems can reflect cultural beliefs and values, not just logical constructs.

> [!idea] Markings
> 
> Venn diagrams use specific marking conventions to **indicate information about class contents:**
> 
> - **Shading**: Indicates an empty set or region (contains no members)
>     - Used to show exclusion relationships like "No S are P"
>     - Helps visualize universal negative statements
> - **X mark**: Indicates a region contains at least one member
>     - Used to show existence relationships like "Some S are P"
>     - Helps visualize particular affirmative statements
> - **White/unmarked**: Indicates insufficient information about that region
>     - Neither confirms nor denies the existence of members
>     - Represents areas where no specific claim has been made

> [!example] Representing Categorical Statements
> All trout are fish (there are no trouth )
> ![[Pasted image 20250325193726.png|500]]
