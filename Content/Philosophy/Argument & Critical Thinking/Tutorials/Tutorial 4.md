I apologize for misunderstanding. Let me format the questions properly with each option on a completely separate line:

> [!example] Validity and Venn Diagrams - Questions
> 
> 1. Which of the following kinds of argument _must be_ **invalid**?
> 
> a. An argument with a false conclusion.
> 
> b. An argument with premises that are _all_ false.
> 
> c. An argument with all premises true and a false conclusion.
> 
> d. An argument with all premises false and a true conclusion.
> 
> 2. Describe in your own words the difference between a **valid** argument and a **sound** argument.

> [!example] Method of Counterexample - Questions
> 
> 3. Apply the **method of counterexample** to show that the following arguments are _invalid_.
> 
> a. Chelsea played Arsenal today. Apparently, Chelsea didn't win, so Arsenal must have won.
> 
> b. Madonna is annoying - she's a singer and lots of singers are really self-obsessed and irritating.
> 
> c. If Jones was the getaway driver, then Jones was involved in the robbery. But Jones can't drive a car, so Jones obviously _wasn't_ involved.

> [!example] Method of Analogy - Questions
> 
> 4. Apply the **method of analogy** to show that the following arguments are _invalid_.
> 
> a. Some stars are not red giants. So, some red giants are not stars.
> 
> b. No prime number is even. Therefore, all odd numbers are primes. _Note:_ Every odd number is _not even_ (divisible by 2) and _vice versa_.
> 
> c. Latvian's regard lamprey as a delicacy and lamprey are fish. So, if pike are fish*, *Latvian's should also regard them as a delicacy.

> [!example] Venn Diagrams for Statements - Questions
> 
> 5. Draw a **Venn diagram** for each statement below using the suggested labels.
> 
> a. No tutors (T) are wealthy (W).
> 
> b. Some billionaires (B) are self-made (S).
> 
> c. Every mudblood (M) is a wizard or a witch (W).

> [!example] Venn Diagrams for Arguments - Questions
> 
> 6. For each of the arguments below, use a **Venn diagram** to decide if it is _valid_.
> 
> a. Some stars are red giants. So, all red giants are stars.
> 
> b. All Lutherans are protestants and as no protestant is a Catholic, Lutherans aren't Catholics.
>
