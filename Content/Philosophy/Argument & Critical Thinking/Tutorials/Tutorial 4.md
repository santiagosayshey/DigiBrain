> 1. Which of the following kinds of argument _must be_ **invalid**?
>     
> 
> - a. An argument with a false conclusion.
>     
> - b. An argument with premises that are _all_ false.
>     
> - ** c. An argument with all premises true and a false conclusion.**
>     
> - d. An argument with all premises false and a true conclusion.
>     
> 
> 2. Describe in your own words the difference between a **valid** argument and a **sound** argument.
> 
> A valid argument exists when a conclusion MUST be true when all premises are true. I.e. there exists no scenario where the conclusion is false if the premises are true. A sound argument is a valid argument where all the premises are true too.

> [!example] Method of Counterexample - Questions
> 
> 3. Apply the **method of counterexample** to show that the following arguments are _invalid_.
>     
> 
> - a. Chelsea played Arsenal today. Apparently, Chelsea didn't win, so Arsenal must have won. 
> 	- The game could have been postponed in which neither team won.
> 
> 
> - b. Madonna is annoying - she's a singer and lots of singers are really self-obsessed and irritating.
> 	- Plenty of singers who aren't annoying. Like Weird Al. Yes. Weird Al.
>     
> - c. If Jones was the getaway driver, then Jones was involved in the robbery. But Jones can't drive a car, so Jones obviously _wasn't_ involved.
> 	- He could have planned the robbery. He could have robbed the place and been part of the inside crew. 
>     

> [!example] Method of Analogy - Questions
> 
> 4. Apply the **method of analogy** to show that the following arguments are _invalid_.
>     
> 
> - a. Some stars are not red giants. So, some red giants are not stars.
> 	- Some S are not G. So, some G are not S.
> 	- Some humans are not smart, so some smart people are not human. 
>     
> - b. No prime number is even. Therefore, all odd numbers are primes. _Note:_ Every odd number is _not even_ (divisible by 2) and _vice versa_.
> 	- No X is Y. Therefore, no X is not Y. 
> 	- 
>     
> - c. Latvians regard lamprey as a delicacy and lamprey are fish. So, if pike are fish, Latvians should also regard them as a delicacy.

> 
> 6. For each of the arguments below, use a **Venn diagram** to decide if it is _valid_.
>     
> 
> - a. Some stars are red giants. So, all red giants are stars.
>     
> - b. All Lutherans are protestants and as no protestant is a Catholic, Lutherans aren't Catholics.
>     
> - c. Some foresters are not Greens. Some Tasmanians are foresters, which means some Tasmanians are not Greens.
