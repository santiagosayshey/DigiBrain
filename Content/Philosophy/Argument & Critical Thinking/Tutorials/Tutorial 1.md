It must be great: I'll buy some.                                       | No                                                 | It's taking the information at face value without ever considering the alternative - that it's not the best beer in the world.

If your only goal is to enjoy food, then youve outlined all the evidence and come to a reasonable conclusion. food is good, therefore i should eat it. However, what if we consider health? Are french fries healthy? Not really - and maybe i should consider again if i should eat them all the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 5. My friend has hurt his leg and is lying close to me, in pain: I must rush and help him right now.                         | In the middle                                      | This is similar to the french fry example. With the limited evidence, it seems logical to make a decision like that. However, what if we consider other things - like how his friend hurt his leg. If I am with him, and he is hurt, am I hurt too? I should also consider that before trying to help someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6. My friend has hurt his leg and is lying on the other side of that busy road, in pain: I must rush and help him right now. | In the middle, but more critical than the last one | This is the same reasoning as last time, but the person now considers the environment at hand. It would be uncritical to not think about the busy road, not the act of defying it. You can still critically analyse something as perhaps dangerous, but choosing to do it, even despite the evidence is not uncritical in and of itself. Dangerous maybe, but not uncr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

> Critical thinking helps us achieve objectivity: understanding things as they actually are. The opposite of objectivity is bias. What is bias?
> 
> **Answer:** Bias is when our underlying assumptions and knowledge, whether consciously or not, dictate our actions, thoughts and judgements towards other things. 

> [!example] Question 4

> Consider the two examples below. What makes them biased? How do they differ?
> 
> **a.** The prime minister's spokesperson insisted that the prime minister acted in good faith and with the best of intentions, unlike her cowardly critics.

> **Answer:** A spokesperson's job is to speak (kindly) for / of someone else. They are consciously aware of this fact.

> **b.** Voters across the country tend to prefer the taller and more conventionally good-looking of two candidates when comparing their photographs.
