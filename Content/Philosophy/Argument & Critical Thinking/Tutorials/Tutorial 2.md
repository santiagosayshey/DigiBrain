> [!example] Identifying Arguments
> 
> **Question 1:** Below are three different ways someone might approach a job interview. Only one of them presents both a _conclusion_ and a _line of reasoning_. Try to identify which one.
>

> [!example] Spotting Conclusions

> **Question 2:** Sometimes it can be hard to identify an argument. A useful method is to search for a conclusion. In the three passages below, see if you can spot a conclusion and decide whether they are arguments or not.

> 
> a. It's immoral to buy incredibly cheap clothing from the major retailers.

> 
> c. Some of the clothing we buy is incredibly cheap because the people making it are paid so little.

> [!example] Persuasion Without Reasons
> 
> **Question 4:** A second way you can fail to argue is by trying to persuade _without relying on reasons_. Consider the passages below. What kinds of persuasion are at work here? _Hint_: only one of them relies (solely) on reasons.
>

> c. I've worked with major-league disruptors in the disintermediation space, and I know how to radically rethink verticals in this horizontals-focused climate. I'm your guy.
