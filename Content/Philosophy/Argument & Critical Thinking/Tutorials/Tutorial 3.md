> **a. Wine in Opaque Glasses**
> 
> Since drinking wine is meant to be a multi-sensory experience, you should be able to see the wine while you taste it. Therefore, wine should not be served in opaque glasses.

> **b. Violence in Media**
> 
> Violence in movies is not evidence of people's declining moral standards as some critics claim. Ancient myths, medieval biographies of saints, Shakespeare's plays, and nineteenth-century novels like Dracula are all full of bloodshed and mayhem. People have always been attracted to fictionalized violence.

> 
> Mary was alone in the house when she went to bed, and when she is alone she always leaves the hall light on, so it should still have been on when Dave got home. But he swears it was off. That means that somebody else must have turned it off.

> [!example] Complex Arguments
> 
> Choose one of the following complex arguments to analyze. Number the statements, and try to work out which are premises, sub-conclusions and conclusion. Then diagram the argument.
> 
> **a. Police Corruption**
> 
> A record number of accusations does not necessarily suggest a bent police force. The reality is that there have always been dishonest, sometimes corrupt police in Victoria, just as in other jurisdictions.
> 
> So the news that 52 Victorian police officers from a workforce of around 12,800 have been stood down, while being investigated for criminal acts should perhaps come as no surprise.
> 
> The number represents 0.42 per cent of the total police workforce. Yet the fact that this is a record number does not necessarily suggest that Victoria's police officers have suddenly become more dishonest. What it does suggest is that their transgressions are being more rigorously investigated and prosecuted.

> 
> **b. Star Signs**
> 
> Note that there are two arguments in this extract, one for and one against.
> 
> IN a finding astrologers should have seen coming, researchers have turned up no evidence to support a link between personality, intelligence and birth dates. The study of more than 15,000 people found "in no cases did date of birth relate to individual differences in personality or intelligence."
> 
> The authors, from universities in Germany and Denmark, wanted to further examine a link between date of birth and popular signs in astrology, but found "no support". In the May issue of Personality and Individual Differences, the authors write: "We conclude that the present large-scale study provides no evidence for the existence of relevant relationships between date of birth and individual differences in personality and general intelligence... and thus yields no support for the common claims of astrology."
> 
> British television astrologer Russell Grant said the survey needed to distinguish between "pop" astrology and "proper" astrology. "We all know that the sun signs as used in newspapers and magazines as a form of entertainment, because we cannot sum up all people in terms of 12 signs," he said. "But proper astrology is based on where all the planets are at the exact time of someone's birth, and that has been used for thousands of years."

> 
> **c. Students on Easy Street**
> 
> EFFORTS to measure learning outcomes have new urgency after a leading US study suggested many university students aren't gaining additional critical thinking, analytic or writing skills.
> 
> The results are based on the US Collegiate Learning Assessment test that has been proposed by the Gillard government as a measure of teaching performance, but has met with opposition from parts of the sector as too US-focused and generic.
> 
> The SSRC study authors concluded many students aren't being pushed hard enough. They found 32 per cent of students didn't take any courses requiring more than 40 pages of reading a week, and 50 per cent didn't take any course requiring more than 20 pages of written work a semester. About 35 per cent reported spending five hours or less per week studying alone.
> 
> "The main message is that large numbers of students are moving through college with too little asked of them in terms of academic rigour, and too little asked of them in terms of applying themselves," study co-author Richard Arum of New York University.
> 
> The US researchers acknowledge the CLA test isn't perfect, but they were encouraged by the correlation between the limited learning suggested by the test and the limited academic work students undertook.
