> Given: "All snakes are reptiles"

> ![[Group 11.png|200]]
> 
> Draw Venn diagrams and determine if these statements are True, False, or Could Be Either:
> 
> a. "Some snakes are reptiles"
> - Could be either, we don't have enough info. It would be true if we also knew if at least 1 snake exists. It would be false if no snakes exist. 
> 
> b. "No snakes are not reptiles"
> - This is true. This is logically equivalent to the premise. 
> 
> c. "Some things that are not reptiles are snakes"
> - Could be true, but we only have information about snakes and reptiles and snakes
> 


> [!example] Venn Exercise 2
> 
> Using the Venn diagram from Exercise 1 with "All snakes are reptiles" as true, determine if these arguments are valid:
> 
> a. All S are R Therefore, some S are R
> - invalid. all humans breathe, therefore some humans are breathing right now. highly likely, but still potentially wrong. 
> 
> b. All S are R Therefore, no S are not R
> - valid. all humans breathe, therefore there are no humans that don't breathe. 
> 
> c. All S are R Therefore, some not-R are S
> - invalid. all humans breathe, therefore some non breathing things are human. 

Visual illusions and cognitive biases are errors that expose the shortcuts our minds use to process information quickly.   
  
- Visual illusions reveal our visual systems make assumptions about things like  color, depth, lighting and shape to interpret our surroundings efficiently.   
- Cognitive biases reveal how out thinking relies on mental shortcuts to make rapid judgements and decisions.  
  
These aren't random failures of our mind, but predictable mistakes that are usually helpful decision making systems in similar scenarios. They break down when we encounter situations they weren't designed for. Studying these breakdowns helps us to gain insight into underlying rules and assumptions that normally guide our perception and thinking.
