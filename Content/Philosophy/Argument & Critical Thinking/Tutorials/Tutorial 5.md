> Given: "All snakes are reptiles"

> 
> Draw Venn diagrams and determine if these statements are True, False, or Could Be Either:
> 
> a. "Some snakes are reptiles"
> - Could be either, we don't have enough info. It would be true if we also knew if at least 1 snake exists. It would be false if no snakes exist. 
> 
> b. "No snakes are not reptiles"
> - This is true. This is logically equivalent to the premise. 
> 
> c. "Some things that are not reptiles are snakes"
> - Could be true, but we only have information about snakes and reptiles and snakes
> 


> [!example] Venn Exercise 2
> 
> Using the Venn diagram from Exercise 1 with "All snakes are reptiles" as true, determine if these arguments are valid:
> 
> a. All S are R Therefore, some S are R
> - invalid. all humans breathe, therefore some humans are breathing right now. highly likely, but still potentially wrong. 
> 
> b. All S are R Therefore, no S are not R
> - valid. all humans breathe, therefore there are no humans that don't breathe. 
> 
> c. All S are R Therefore, some not-R are S
> - invalid. all humans breathe, therefore some non breathing things are human.
