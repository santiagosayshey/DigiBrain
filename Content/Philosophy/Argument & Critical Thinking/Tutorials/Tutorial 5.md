> [!example] Venn Exercise 1

> Given: "All snakes are reptiles"

> ![[Group 11.png|200]]
> 
> Draw Venn diagrams and determine if these statements are True, False, or Could Be Either:
> 
> a. "Some snakes are reptiles"
> - Could be either, we don't have enough info. It would be true if we also knew if at least 1 snake exists. 
> 
> b. "No snakes are not reptiles"
> - This is true. 
> 
> c. "Some things that are not reptiles are snakes"
> 
> ```image_goes_here
> Draw two overlapping circles:
> - One circle labeled S for Snakes
> - One circle labeled R for Reptiles
> - Show the given statement "All snakes are reptiles" by placing S entirely within R
> ```

> [!example] Venn Exercise 2
> 
> Using the Venn diagram from Exercise 1 with "All snakes are reptiles" as true, determine if these arguments are valid:
> 
> a. All S are R Therefore, some S are R
> 
> b. All S are R Therefore, no S are not R
> 
> c. All S are R Therefore, some not-R are S
