> Climate change is a serious global threat because average temperatures have risen significantly over the past century. Scientific measurements show glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates, and sea levels are rising. Since these changes threaten coastal communities and ecosystems, governments must implement stricter carbon emission regulations. Although some argue these regulations could harm economic growth, several studies have shown that renewable energy industries create more jobs than fossil fuel industries. Therefore, addressing climate change through regulations is both environmentally necessary and economically beneficial in the long run.




Now I'll create an SVG artifact showing the argument mapping with different types of premises and conclusions:

The argument map shows how the different premises and conclusions relate in the text excerpt about climate change regulations. Here's a breakdown of what's represented:

**Structure of the Argument:**

1. **Main Conclusion:** Addressing climate change through regulations is both environmentally necessary and economically beneficial in the long run.
    
2. **Sub-conclusions:**
    
    - Sub-conclusion 1: Governments must implement stricter carbon emission regulations
    - Sub-conclusion 2: Regulations are economically beneficial in the long run
3. **Joint Premises** (support Sub-conclusion 1 together):
    
    - Premise 1A: Climate change is a serious global threat
    - Premise 1B: Changes threaten coastal communities and ecosystems
4. **Independent Premises** (each supports Sub-conclusion 1 on its own):
    
    - Premise 2: Average temperatures have risen significantly over the past century
    - Premise 3: Glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates and sea levels are rising
5. **Objection and Rebuttal:**
    
    - Objection: Regulations could harm economic growth
    - Rebuttal: Renewable energy industries create more jobs than fossil fuel industries

The map illustrates different types of premise relationships:

- Joint premises (must be taken together to support a conclusion)
- Independent premises (each individually supports a conclusion)
- The objection-rebuttal structure shows how counterarguments are addressed
- Sub-conclusions that together support the main conclusion

This visualization helps clarify the logical structure of arguments by showing how different statements relate to and support each other.
