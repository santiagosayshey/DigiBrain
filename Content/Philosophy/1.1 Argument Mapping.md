> [!motivation] Argument Mapping
> 
> Arguments in natural language are often unclear, convoluted, and difficult to analyze. Written and spoken arguments frequently:
> 
> - Mix premises and conclusions without clear organization
> - Contain implicit assumptions not explicitly stated
> - Include irrelevant information that obscures the logical structure
> - Present complex relationships between multiple claims
> 
> These issues make it challenging to evaluate the strength and validity of arguments, identify flaws in reasoning, and communicate complex arguments effectively.

> [!idea] Argument Map Structure
> 
> Argument maps are visual representations that display the logical structure of arguments using boxes and arrows.
> 
> **Core Components:**
> 
> - **Conclusion/Claim**: The main point being argued for (typically at the top of the map)
> - **Premises**: Statements offered as support for a conclusion
> - **Inferential relationships**: Connections between premises and conclusions
> 
> |Component|Visual Representation|Function|
> |---|---|---|
> |Conclusion|Box (often at top)|States what is being argued for|
> |Premise|Box (below conclusions)|Provides support for conclusions|
> |Inference|Arrow pointing upward|Shows supporting relationship|

> [!idea] Premise Types
> 
> **Independent Premises**: Provide support for a conclusion on their own
> 
> - Each can stand alone as support
> - Indicated by separate arrows leading to the conclusion
> 
> **Joint/Co-Premises**: Multiple premises that work together to support a conclusion
> 
> - Must be considered collectively to provide support
> - Often linked with brackets or grouped arrows
> - None of the premises provides adequate support individually

> [!idea] Advanced Argument Elements
> 
> **Sub-conclusions**: Claims that serve as both:
> 
> - Conclusions supported by lower-level premises
> - Premises supporting higher-level conclusions
> 
> **Objections**: Counter-arguments or potential problems with a claim
> 
> - Often displayed in contrasting colors or with different arrow types
> - Can target premises or conclusions
> 
> **Rebuttals**: Responses to objections that defend the original argument
> 
> - Connect to objections, often shown with distinctive formatting

> [!example] Simple Argument Map Example
> 
> **Text**: "Climate change is real because global temperatures have risen significantly over the past century. Additionally, the vast majority of climate scientists agree on this point. Since climate change is real and poses serious risks to ecosystems, we need to reduce carbon emissions immediately."
> 
> **Map Structure:**
> 
> - **Main Conclusion** (top): "We need to reduce carbon emissions immediately"
> - **Sub-conclusion** (middle): "Climate change is real and poses serious risks"
>     - Supported by two independent premises:
>         - "Global temperatures have risen significantly over the past century"
>         - "The vast majority of climate scientists agree on this point"
>     - And one unstated premise (often included in maps): "Serious risks require immediate action"
> 
> This structure clearly separates the factual claims about climate change from the value judgment about the need for action, making it easier to evaluate each component of the argument separately.
