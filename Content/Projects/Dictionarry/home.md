# Hello!

Welcome to Dictionarry! This project aims to wiki-fy and simplify media automation in Radarr / Sonarr through extensive, data driven documentation, custom formats and quality profiles.

## Motivation

Navigating the world of **niche quality terms** like "Remux", or "HEVC" or "Dolby Vision" can be quite daunting when all you want to do is setup a media server to watch some content. If often **feels like you need a masters in audio / video just to grab the latest blockbuster.** Dictionarry aims not to answer these questions, but **abstract them into more approachable ones** that don't require extensive knowledge or experience. 

## How?

Radarr and Sonarr grab content using mult

1. Custom Formats - explain
2. Quality Profiles - explain
