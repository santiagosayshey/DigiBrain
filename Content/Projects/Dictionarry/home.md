# Hello!

Welcome to Dictionarry! This project aims to wiki-fy and simplify media automation in Radarr / Sonarr through extensive, data driven documentation, custom formats and quality profiles.

## Motivation

Navigating the world of **niche quality terms** like "Remux", or "HEVC" or "Dolby Vision" can be quite daunting when all you want to do is setup a media server to watch some content. If often **feels like you need a masters in audio / video just to grab the latest blockbuster.** Dictionarry aims not to answer these questions, but **abstract them into more approachable ones** that don't require extensive knowledge or experience. 

## How?

Dictionarry leverages two key features of Radarr and Sonarr to simplify media automation:

1. **Custom Formats** - Think of these as smart filters that scan release titles for specific patterns. They help identify important characteristics of your media, such as:
   - Video quality (4K, HDR, Dolby Vision)
   - Audio formats (Atmos, DTS, TrueHD)
   - Source types (Remux, Web-DL, Blu-ray)
   - Potential issues (upscaled content, poor encodes)

2. **Quality Profiles** - These act like a scoring system that ranks releases based on their Custom Format matches. You can:
   - Prioritize what matters most to you
   - Automatically upgrade to better versions
   - Avoid problematic releases

Think of it like shopping for a car: Instead of needing to understand every technical specification, Dictionarry helps you focus on what matters to you (like "great sound" or "best picture quality") and handles the technical details behind the scenes.
