So, how does Dictionarry *actually simplify media automation...?* 

Well, first we need to understand what we're trying to automate - the subjective, expensive, manual analysis of how good a release is. Your first instinct would be to rank releases based on their technical information, like if they have HDR, or if they have lossless audio, or their resolution 

- rank release groups
- release groups are the most consistent and simple way to measure how "good" something is. 
	- if group A has a proven track record of achieving metric A, then it should be prioritsed
	- if group B has a proven track record of achieving metric B, then IT should be prioritised
- ok, well what "track records" are we measuring? 
- well, the two most important properties of media is its 
	- quality - how good it looks / sounds
	- efficiency - how well it utilises its file size
- so, we rank release groups based on how consistently they achieve certain levels of quality and or efficiency.
- ok, but how we quantify this?
	- data driven analysis through two key metrics
