0 score custom formats 
- we want to import formats that aren't nessecarily scored, but still found for renaming purposes
- for example, we score resolution specific streaming services, but not the general one
	- we want the general one to be included to be used in the rename


renaming
- need to include "include custom format when renaming" field for each CF
- question is - how can we store this without directly adding it to custom format yml files?
