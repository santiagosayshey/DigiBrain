| Why isn't the highest scored release being grabbed?                 | You may have prefer propers and repacks on. This option forces releases with a proper / repack flag to be grabbed, even if it's Custom Format score is not the highest. To turn it off, navigate to Settings > Media Management > File Management and set Prefer Propers / Repacks to Do Not Prefer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| What quality settings should I use?                                 | It's suggested that you should set everything to min / max since Profilarr uses custom formats to do the major selections. However you might run into the occasional sample download if you use lots of usenet indexers. If you do find that these are being grabbed, then you can set the minimum to be 1-2gb per hour for whatever quality you need it in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| What does "Transparency" mean?                                      | Audiovisual transparency refers to the degree to which an encoded audio or video signal is indistinguishable from the original source signal. The term "transparency" stems from the idea that the encoding and decoding processes are imperceptible, as if the system were *transparent*.<br><br>- An audio codec with high transparency will produce an encoded signal that, when decoded, is identical to the original audio source, without any discernible differences in frequency response, dynamic range, or noise floor.<br><br>- A video codec exhibiting transparency will generate an encoded signal that, upon decoding, results in a picture that is visually indistinguishable from the source video in terms of resolution, color space, and pixel-level detail.<br><br>Objective metrics, such as [VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Multimethod_Assessment_Fusion), are sometimes used to measure transparency by comparing the encoded signal to the original source and calculating a numerical score that quantifies the perceptual similarity between the two, with higher scores indicating greater transparency. |
