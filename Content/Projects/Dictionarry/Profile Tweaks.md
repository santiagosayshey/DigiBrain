hey @everyone, I've been hard at work on the next Profilarr version over the past few weeks and have a new feature to show off!

## Profile Tweaks
The profiles we make are meant to be (really good) starting points, not a strict standard on what you *should* be grabbing. Up until now, profiles existed as singular entities that don't respect custom changes. Merge conflict resolution was a big step in the right direction for this (read more in the last dev log), but it's a bit more hands on, and not something I expect most people to engage with. 

Enter 'Profile Tweaks'. These are simple check boxes you can enable / disable unique to each profile, and will ALWAYS be respected, regardless of what updates we make to the base profile. For now, these tweaks include:

- Prefer Freeleech
- Allow Prereleases (CAMS, Screeners, etc)
- Language Strictness
- Allow Lossless audio
