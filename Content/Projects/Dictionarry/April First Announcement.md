hey @everyone, long awaited announcement :)

## Profilarr is in Beta

Many people are already aware, but I thought I should formally announce here on discord that Profilarr is out in beta! I've been working on it since around July last year and put in a massive effort over the Christmas break to get it working. Even though it's not nearly as stable as I would like it to be, it implements the core architecture I first talked about [here](https://dictionarry.dev/devlog/architecture_overhaul). There is still so (so) much to be done in terms of bugs & polish & new features, but I'm happy sharing it as is. Hopefully 

### Tweaks

I talked about tweaks in detail [here](https://dictionarry.dev/devlog/profile_tweaks) and had actually implemented some of them into Profilarr, but decided to remove them at the last minute. On paper, it's an interesting system. In practice, it's confusing and really hard to program for. It's meant to be a database agnostic feature, but was hardcoded into profilarr's profile system. I'm going to keep this feature on the roadmap as maybe for now, but I'm gonna have to completely rethink how to implement it from the ground up.
