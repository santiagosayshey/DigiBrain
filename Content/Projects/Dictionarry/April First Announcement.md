hey @everyone, long awaited announcement :)

## Profilarr is in Beta

Many people are already aware, but I thought I should formally announce here on discord that Profilarr is out in beta! I've been working on it since around July last year and put in a massive effort over the Christmas break to get it working. Even though it's not nearly as stable as I would like it to be, it implements the core architecture I first talked about [here](https://dictionarry.dev/devlog/architecture_overhaul). There is still so much to be done but it's in a state that I'm happy letting other people use/test on their own now.
