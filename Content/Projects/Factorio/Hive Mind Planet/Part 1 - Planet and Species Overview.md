## Planet Background

Welcome to Myrmidia, named after the ancient goddess of ants and universal consciousness. This world was not discovered by chance - ancient ruins on Fulgora spoke of a "planet of infinite minds," where their civilization's greatest minds ventured but never returned. Their fragmentary records described attempts to harness some form of collective consciousness technology, but each expedition ended in silence.

The Engineer's arrival on Myrmidia was no accident. While humanity has mastered interplanetary travel and factory automation, the dream of true parallel consciousness - the ability to exist and think in multiple places simultaneously - remains elusive. The ancient Fulgoran texts hinted at the solution lying within Myrmidia's native life forms.

Your "crash landing" was a calculated risk. The Fulgoran records revealed that conventional landings triggered massive defensive responses from the planet's inhabitants. By simulating a crash in one of the planet's rare "dead zones" - regions where no queen's influence reaches - you've managed to establish a foothold. These zones, while still dangerous, offer a relatively safe starting position away from organized ant colonies. Here, you'll encounter only straggler ants, disconnected from their hivemind and acting on basic instincts.

The rest of the planet's surface is divided into distinct territories, each controlled by a queen ant. These territories function as independent superorganisms, with clear pheromone-defined boundaries that your research can detect. Understanding and ultimately harnessing their quantum neural network technology could revolutionize human consciousness and factory expansion across the galaxy.

As the old engineer's saying goes: "The factory must grow." But on Myrmidia, you might discover that growth isn't just about size - it's about existing in many places at once.

## Ant Species Biology

The planet's dominant life form has evolved three remarkable adaptations that make them both a formidable threat and a valuable resource:

**Reinforced Exoskeletons**  
Their chitinous armor represents a leap in evolutionary engineering. The exoskeleton's molecular structure incorporates trace metals throughout, creating a material that surpasses any Earth-based equivalent in strength-to-weight ratio. This metallic integration makes their armor incredibly durable but also introduces a critical vulnerability to electrical attacks.

This unique chitin demonstrates extraordinary properties:

- Absorbs and redirects kinetic energy, making them immune to traditional bullets
- Distributes explosive force through its lattice structure, neutralizing missile damage
- Creates a reflective surface that scatters laser energy
- Conducts electricity extremely efficiently through its metallic-infused structure

**Hydrocarbon-Rich Metabolism**  
These creatures have evolved to synthesize and store complex hydrocarbons as energy reserves. Their digestive systems produce biological compounds remarkably similar to petroleum, stored in specialized hydrocarbon sacs. These energy-dense compounds can be processed into various oil products, though the initial extraction process proves incredibly inefficient without proper catalysts.

**Quantum Neural Network**  
Perhaps their most extraordinary feature is their advanced neural system. Unlike Earth's ants, these beings have developed specialized neural ganglia exhibiting quantum entanglement properties. This allows the colony to function as a true hivemind, sharing information instantaneously across vast distances without conventional communication methods. Each ant serves as a node in this distributed consciousness network, with the queen acting as the central processor.

## Colony Structure

**Territory Organization**  
Each queen maintains absolute control over her territory through:

- Specialized pheromones that define territory boundaries
- Quantum entanglement nodes that maintain the colony's hivemind
- Direct neural links to every worker ant in her domain

Worker ants within a territory completely depend on their quantum connection to the queen. This dependency means that when a queen dies, her entire neural network collapses. Without the queen's coordinating consciousness, workers lose their hivemind connection, becoming disoriented and eventually dying off.

**The Colonial Neurophore**  
At the heart of each queen lies a remarkable organ - the Colonial Neurophore. This crystalline structure serves as the master control node for the entire colony's quantum network. More than just a biological computer, it contains the fundamental patterns of consciousness transfer that allow the queen to maintain simultaneous awareness across thousands of workers.

This creates a strategic choice for players: maintaining live queens provides a sustainable source of worker ants for resources, while killing a queen yields her valuable Colonial Neurophore but permanently eliminates that territory as a resource source.
