## Early Game Mechanics

Your first challenge on Mentis is survival and resource establishment in the dead zone. While safer than ant territories, this area presents its own unique challenges and opportunities.

**Initial Combat**  
Traditional weapons prove useless against even the weakest ants:

- Bullets are absorbed by their chitin, actually strengthening their exoskeletons
- Missiles' explosive force dissipates through their lattice armor structure
- Laser weapons scatter off their reflective surfaces

However, their metallic-infused exoskeletons have a critical weakness: electricity. Early defense relies on:

- Tesla turrets and weapons targeting their conductive armor
- High voltage causing cascade failures in their neural pathways
- Electrical damage disrupting their remaining quantum coherence

**Resource Collection**  
Defeated straggler ants can be harvested for three essential components:

_Reinforced Chitin Plates_

- Primary structural component of ant exoskeletons
- Can be recycled into 2 Iron Ore and 2 Copper Ore
- Requires smelting before use in advanced recipes

_Neural Matrix Clusters_

- Remnants of quantum neural tissue
- Recycling yields three possible components (per attempt):
    - Synaptic Resonators (40% chance) - Primary computation nodes
    - Entanglement Cores (35% chance) - Quantum coherence maintainers
    - Memory Strands (25% chance) - Information storage and transfer
- Each component rolls independently, allowing for 0-3 components per cluster

_Hydrocarbon Sacs_

- Biological energy storage organs
- Cannot be recycled further
- Used directly in oil production

**Resource Processing**  
The Engineer must utilize two key facilities for basic resource processing:

_The Recycler_

- Breaks down chitin into base ores
- Extracts neural components
- Must deal with the randomness of neural tissue recycling

_Assembly Machines_

- Processes recycled ore into plates
- Creates electronic circuits from processed metals
- Essential for early base establishment

This initial phase focuses on:

- Establishing basic defenses against straggler ants
- Building up a stockpile of basic resources
- Preparing for expansion beyond the dead zone
