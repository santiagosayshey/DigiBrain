## Strategic Territory Decisions

As you expand across Mentis, you face a crucial decision with each ant colony encountered:

**Preserve the Colony**
- Maintain a renewable source of worker ant carcasses
- Steady flow of all three basic components
- Requires constant defense against worker attacks
- Must manage power grid for tesla turret networks

**Hunt the Queen**
- Permanently eliminates colony as a resource source
- Yields the precious Colonial Neurophore
- Territory becomes permanently safe for expansion
- One step closer to consciousness transfer technology

## Queen Combat

Confronting a queen requires careful preparation and represents one of the most challenging encounters on Mentis.

**Colony Penetration**
- Fight through dense waves of coordinated worker ants
- Must establish forward bases with robust power networks
- Tesla weapons become less effective deeper in colony
- EMP rockets required to create safe corridors

**Queen Encounter** A three-phase boss fight testing all your technological mastery:
1. Queen's neural field negates electrical damage
2. EMP warhead temporarily disrupts quantum shielding
3. Conventional weapons damage phase (railgun/rockets)
4. Shield regenerates - repeat twice more

Upon defeat, the queen's death triggers complete neural network collapse across her territory. All connected workers lose consciousness immediately, and the Colonial Neurophore can be harvested from her remains.

## Jump Clone Technology

The Colonial Neurophore contains the key to true parallel consciousness - the ability to exist in multiple places simultaneously with perfect fidelity.

**Jump Clone Recipe**

|Component|Quantity|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Colonial Neurophore|1|Provides consciousness transfer framework|
|Reinforced Chitin Plates|500|Forms clone's structural shell|
|Neural Matrix Clusters|500|Creates quantum computing substrate|
|Hydrocarbon Sacs|500|Powers biological processes|
|Prometheum Chunks|100|Stabilizes quantum field across clones|

**Capabilities**

- True consciousness transfer between bodies
- Instant switching between any active clones
- No range limitation due to quantum entanglement

This technology represents mastery over the ant's most advanced adaptation - their quantum neural network. Through the Colonial Neurophore, you can achieve what the Fulgorans sought: the ability to truly exist in multiple places at once, overcoming the fundamental limits of space and consciousness.

The factory must grow... and now it can grow everywhere simultaneously.
