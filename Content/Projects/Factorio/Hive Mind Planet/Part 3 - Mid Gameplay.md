## Core Gameplay Loop

With the Organic Synthesizer constructed and initial resources depleted, survival on Mentis enters a new phase. The core gameplay loop revolves around a careful balance of expansion, defense, and resource collection.

**Colony Expansion**

- Building into ant territory triggers defensive responses
- Soldier ants emerge to attack your structures
- Tesla turret networks must be established at expansion boundaries
- Power management becomes critical due to high electrical requirements

**Night Operations** The ants' quantum neural network requires periodic rest, creating opportunities:

- Colonies become dormant during night cycles
- Spidertron expeditions can safely collect recent carcasses
- Must return before dawn when quantum coherence is restored
- Each successful raid provides materials for further expansion

**Resource Processing Chain**

1. Spidertrons collect ant carcasses from nocturnal raids
2. Automated recyclers break down components
3. Organic Synthesizer processes materials into advanced products
4. New defenses and structures are built using processed materials
5. Cycle repeats with deeper expansion into territories

## The Organic Synthesizer in Detail

This living factory processes ant-based materials in unique ways, combining biological and mechanical processes.

## Rocket Construction

Escape from Mentis requires adapting ant biology into traditional rocket components:

|Component|Resource Chain|Processing Steps|
|---|---|---|
|Low Density Structures|Reinforced Chitin Plates|1. Recycle into ores<br>2. Smelt into plates<br>3. Combine in Synthesizer|
|Processing Units|Neural Matrix Clusters|1. Recycle for components<br>2. Combine in Synthesizer|
|Rocket Fuel|Hydrocarbon Sacs|1. Convert to crude oil<br>2. Process through enhanced production<br>3. Standard refining to rocket fuel|

The choice to leave, however, becomes more complex as you unlock deeper understanding of the ants' quantum neural technology...
