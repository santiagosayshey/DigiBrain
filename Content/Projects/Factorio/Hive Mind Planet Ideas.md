## Creature: Evolved Ants

|Component|Real Biological Basis|In-Game Resource|Processing/Usage|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Exoskeleton**|Chitin-based armor found in ants, particularly reinforced in species like Cephalotes|Lightweight Durable Structure (LDS)|Harvested from worker ants, processed into building materials|
|**Neural Tissue**|Ant neural ganglia and distributed colony intelligence|Quantum Processors|Extracted from ant brains, combined with electrical components|
|**Internal Organs**|Fat bodies and biochemical processing systems|Crude Oil|Compressed ant remains processed into light oil products|

## Boss Fight: Queen Ant

|Element|Biological Basis|Game Mechanic|
|---|---|---|
|**Queen Boss**|Specialized reproductive ant with enhanced biology|Challenging encounter requiring specific strategies|
|**Colony Collapse**|Dependence of worker ants on queen pheromones|After queen death, worker ants disperse/die in that area, preventing further farming|
|**Special Component**|Queen's specialized neural tissue|"Queen Ganglion" or "Colonial Neurophore" - rare drop from queen needed for jump clone technology|

## Jump Clone Technology

|Concept|Biological Inspiration|Game Function|
|---|---|---|
|**Jump Clones**|Quantum entanglement theoretically present in specialized queen neural tissue|Allows player consciousness to transfer between bodies on different planets|
|**Clone Construction**|Combination of "Queen Ganglion" with other advanced materials|Late-game technology enabling fast travel between planets|
|**Consciousness Transfer**|Distributed intelligence seen in ant colonies|Player can instantly switch between established clones|

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Early Game**: Farm worker ants for basic resources (LDS, basic processing, oil)
2. **Mid Game**: Develop technology to process ant components into more advanced materials
3. **Late Game**: Defeat queen ant(s) to obtain special neural component
4. **Decision Point**: Balance between maintaining ant farms (by keeping queens alive) vs. obtaining jump clone technology (requiring queen elimination)
5. **Expansion**: Use jump clone technology to efficiently manage multi-planetary factory networks
