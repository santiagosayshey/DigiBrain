# Planet Overview

The planet is dominated by highly evolved ant species that have become the apex life form through millions of years of specialized evolution. These ants have developed three remarkable biological adaptations that make them both a threat and a valuable resource:

1. **Reinforced Exoskeletons**: Their chitinous armor has evolved into an incredibly lightweight yet durable structure. The unique molecular arrangement of their exoskeletons provides strength-to-weight ratios exceeding any natural Earth material. When processed, this chitin can be transformed into exceptional building materials.
2. **Hydrocarbon-Rich Metabolism**: Their digestive systems have evolved to synthesize and store complex hydrocarbons as energy reserves. These biological compounds are remarkably similar to petroleum, allowing their processed remains to be converted into oil products.
3. **Quantum Neural Network**: Perhaps their most extraordinary adaptation is their advanced neural system. Unlike Earth ants, these creatures have developed specialized neural ganglia that exhibit quantum entanglement properties. This allows the colony to function as a true hivemind, sharing information instantaneously across vast distances without conventional communication. Individual ants function as nodes in a distributed consciousness network.

## Territory and Queen Dynamics

The planet's surface is divided into distinct territories, each controlled by a single queen ant. These territories function as effectively independent superorganisms:

- Each queen produces specialized pheromones that define her territory's boundaries
- The queen's neural tissue contains the primary quantum entanglement nodes that maintain the colony's hivemind
- Worker ants within a territory are completely dependent on the quantum connection to their queen

When a queen is killed, the entire neural network for that territory collapses. Without the queen's coordinating consciousness, the worker ants lose their hivemind connection, becoming disoriented and eventually dying off. This creates a strategic resource management decision - killing a queen yields valuable specialized neural tissue but permanently eliminates that territory as a source of regular ant resources.

The queen's specialized neural organ (the Colonial Neurophore or Queen Ganglion) contains the most concentrated form of the quantum-entangled neural tissue, making it essential for advanced technologies that require consciousness transfer or instantaneous information sharing across vast distances.

# Early Game Mechanics & Resource Loop

## Initial Landing Zone

The player's crash landing site is strategically positioned in a "dead zone" - an area devoid of active ant colonies and their corresponding queen influence. This relatively safe starting area contains only disconnected worker ants, wandering aimlessly without their hivemind connection. These straggler ants, while dangerous, are far less coordinated than their colony-connected counterparts.
 
## Basic Resource Collection

Defeating straggler ants allows the player to harvest their carcasses, which can be broken down inside a recycler into three essential components. Each of these components can be recycled down further to get even more basic components. 

| Component                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Recycling Output                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Reinforced Chitin Plates | The ant's exoskeleton represents millions of years of evolution, creating a molecular structure that surpasses any Earth-based material in strength-to-weight ratio. The chitin's unique crystalline matrix incorporates trace metals throughout its structure, making it both incredibly durable and surprisingly conductive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2 Iron Ore + 2 Copper Ore                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hydrocarbon Sacs         | Specialized organs that synthesize and store complex hydrocarbon chains as energy reserves. These biological batteries contain hydrocarbons so perfectly structured that they rival refined petroleum in energy density. The sacs maintain their compounds in a meta-stable state that breaks down if the organ structure is compromised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Recycles into itself (for voiding)                                                                                                                                                   |
| Neural Matrix Clusters   | These clusters of quantum-entangled neural tissue form the basis of the ant colony's hivemind. Each cluster contains three distinct neural structures:<br>- Synaptic Resonators: Primary quantum computation nodes that process colony-wide data<br>- Entanglement Cores: Crystalline structures that maintain quantum coherence across vast distances<br>- Memory Strands: Delicate filaments that store and transmit collective colony information<br><br>The recycling process is brutal on these delicate clusters, but it must be done to break them down into their constituent components. | When recycled, each component has an independent chance of being recovered:<br>- Synaptic Resonator (40% chance)<br>- Entanglement Core (35% chance)<br>- Memory Strand (25% chance) |
## The Organic Synthesizer

After collecting sufficient ant components, players can construct their first major milestone: the Organic Synthesizer. This semi-organic processing facility combines traditional machinery with living tissue, creating a hybrid system capable of complex biochemical reactions.

Key features of the Organic Synthesizer:
- Functions as a biological manufacturing centre
- Unlocks crucial recipes for rocket part construction, and science manufacturing
- Has a base productivity of 100%
- has 4 module slots

| Recipe                         | Inputs                                                       | Outputs                  | Properties & Lore                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low Density Structure Creation | 1 Reinforced Chitin Plate + 2 Iron Plates + 2 Copper Plates  | 2 Low Density Structures | The Synthesizer weaves smelted metals through the chitin's molecular matrix in a precise lattice pattern. The iron plates provide structural reinforcement while the copper plates create conductive pathways that allow the material to dynamically redistribute stress loads. This dual-metal integration requires properly smelted plates - raw ore would disrupt the delicate molecular alignment process. |
| Processing Unit Generation     | 1 Synaptic Resonator + 1 Entanglement Core + 1 Memory Strand | 1 Processing Unit        | The Synthesizer reconstructs the three neural components into a highly efficient computing matrix. While less elegant than the ant's natural neural network, this artificial arrangement creates processing capabilities that match traditional processing units.                                                                                                                                              |
| Crude Oil Production           | 50 Hydrocarbon Sacs                                          | 1 Crude Oil              | The initial conversion process is brutal and inefficient. The Synthesizer must completely break down the complex ant-based hydrocarbons into simpler molecules, losing most of the energy in the process. Without a proper medium to stabilize the conversion, most of the biological compounds are wasted.                                                                                                    |
| Enhanced Oil Production        | 10 Crude Oil + 1 Hydrocarbon Sac                             | 11 Crude Oil             | A breakthrough in efficiency. Using existing crude oil as a stabilizing medium, the Synthesizer can perfectly preserve the hydrocarbon sac's energy. The existing oil provides the exact molecular template needed for the biological compounds to transform cleanly. While the gain seems minimal, the sustainable loop creates unlimited potential.                                                          |
| Quantum-Aligned Fuel           | 2 Neural Matrix Clusters + 5 Hydrocarbon Sacs                | 1 QAF                    | The neural clusters' quantum properties cause the hydrocarbons to align in impossible geometries, creating micro-singularities of fuel. The resulting material is so dense it can't achieve escape velocity, but produces enormous energy when burned. Power output equivalent to 50 standard solid fuel units.                                                                                                |



The Organic Synthesizer must work in conjunction with other buildings:

- The Recycler (for breaking down chitin into metals and quantum processors into processing units)
- Standard Oil Processing buildings (for converting crude oil into rocket fuel)
- Assembly Machines (for creating electronic circuits from recycled metals)

All three rocket components can be manufactured entirely from ant-based resources, eliminating the need for importing materials from other planets.

| Rocket Part            | Resource Chain           | Processing Steps                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low Density Structures | Reinforced Chitin Plates | 1. Recycle some Chitin Plates into Iron and Copper Plates (2 Iron plates and 2 Copper plates per Chitin)<br>2. Combine in Organic Synthesizer: 1 Chitin + 2 Iron plates + 2 copper plates → 2 LDS (essentially 2 chitins)     |

## Resource Depletion & Progression

The limited number of straggler ants in the dead zone creates a natural progression gate. Once players exhaust the initial resource pool, they must:

- Venture beyond the safety of the dead zone
- Confront organized ant colonies
- Deal with coordinated resistance from hivemind-connected workers
- Make strategic decisions about resource collection vs. colony disruption

This resource scarcity pushes players toward the mid-game phase, where they must develop new strategies for dealing with active ant colonies and their queens.
