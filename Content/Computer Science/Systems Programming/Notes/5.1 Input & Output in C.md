## Functions

### Arguments

- A function should always evaluate and return something
	- You can have `void` functions but they are technically not a *function*
- Functions take arguments
- Those arguments exist within the scope of the function and can be altered

```c
int sum (int i1, int i2)
{
	int local = i1 + i2;
	return local;
}
```

- This `sum` function takes in two arguments and returns their sum
- These arguments are an example of **pass by copy**

#### Pass By Copy
- This means arguments, will be copied into a new variable inside the scope of the function
- Any alterations to the copied variable are not carried back to the original variable when the function returns

```c
int sumTroll (int i1, int i2)
{
	it = -7;
	int local = i1 + i2;
	return local
}

int main()
{
	int a =1;
	int b =2;
	int c = sumTroll(a,b);
	// print everything
}
```

- We can see that when printing `a`, we get 1, instead of -7 ( as changed in the `sumTroll` function )
- The variables within the function scope disappear from memory when the function returns to the main scope

#### Pass By Pointer
- If we re-write the original sum function using pointers:

```c
int sumTroll (int* i1, int* i2)
{
	*i1 = -7 // dereference i1 and set it's value to -7
	int local = *i1 + *i2;
	return local;
}

int main() {
	int a =1;
	int b =2;
	int *a_ptr = &a;
	int *b_ptr = &b;
	int c = sumTroll(a,b)
	// print everything
}
```

- This will now update `a` to be -7 since we are attaching the address of a to i1 and updating it's dereferenced value in the function

### Static Variables

```c
int weirdCount() {
	static int not_local = 0; // only called at start of runtime
	not_local++;
	return not_local;
}

int main() {
	int a = weird_count();
	int b = weird_count();
	// print everything
}
```

- A static variable has global scope
	- This means it stays within the memory of the program the entire runtime
- In the above example, a static integer `not_local` is set to 0 at runtime and everytime the function is called, it's incremented by 1
	- This means `a=1` and `b=2`, et al.
	- A static variable inside a function is only initialised `ONCE`

### Static Functions
- Exist only within the file they are contained in
	- This means you can have mulitple files with the same function name but different functionality
	- You can implement polymorphism (kinda) with static functions

## Input & Output
- `printf` and `scanf` instead of `cout` and `cin`

### Output
- Using `printf()`

```c
printf("hello world!");
```

- In c++, we would write

```cpp
cout << "a is " << a << endl;
```

- In C, we would write

```c
printf("a is %d", a);
```

- Where `%d` is where you want to print the variable `a` ( they go in order of arguments)
- Other options include:

```c
%d // base10 signed int
%f // base10 float
%o // base8 signed int
%u // base10 unsigned int
%c // char
%4 // print at least 4 chars
%.2 // print only 2 decimal places
```

### Input

- Using `scanf()`

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int age;
   printf("Enter your age: ");
   scanf("%d", &age);
   printf("You are %d years old.\n", age);
   return 0;
}
```

### File I/O

```C
FILE * fopen (const char* filename, const char* mode);
```

- Different modes:
	- r: read
	- w: write (can create if doesn't exist)
	- a: append (if you don't want to overrite existing files)
	- r+: read and write
	- w+: read and write (length changed to zero)
	- a+: read from start, write from end

- Different read options

```c
int fgetc(FILE * fp ) // ask for a single char
char * fgets(char * buf, int n, FILE * fp) // ask for mulitple chars
```

- Different write options:

```c
int fputc(int c, FILE * fp ) // write one chaer
fputs(const char * c, FILE * fp) // write mulitple chars
```

- Close a file using:

```c
int fclose(FILE *fp);
```

- On success, it will return `0`, on failure it will return `EOF`

#### EOF
- **End-Of-File**
- It means `-1` in the context of a return value
