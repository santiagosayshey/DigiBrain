## Arrays as Function Parameters
- In c++, where you can concatenate strings using `+`, you have to use:
	- `strcat(string1, string2)` in C

- In C++

```cpp
string domain = 'adelaide.edu.au';
string url = 'www.'  + domain;
```

- In C

```C
char url[100] = 'www.';
char domain[100] = 'adelaide.edu.au';
strcat(url, domain) // where the result is stored in url
```

## Function Calling

- What happens when a function returns to the function that called it?

### The Stack
- When you call a function, the current existing variables are frozen in place so that the program can come back to them later
	- They are frozen in their own `stack frame`
	- These `stack frames` are stored in the `stack`, one after another in the order that they're called

### Persistence
- When a function returns to it's parent function, only specific variables will exist ( the return value )
- To get around this we can use different options:
	- Input and Output to files
	- Return value (duh)
	- Using pointers and references as parameters and changing their value
	- Static variables
	- Dynamic Memory

### The Heap
- Using dynamic memory to assign variables

```c
int* newInt(int value) {
	int* result = int* malloc(sizeof(int));
	*result = value;
	return result;
}
```

#### Memory Leaks
- When you have no pointers pointing to memory on the heap
- If you can't find it, you can't `free` it

```c
int* x;         // a pointer
int y =4;       // a variable
x = newInt(3);  // new dynamically stored variable
x =  &y;        // no pointer pointing to previous dynamic variable
```

## String Functions

- What is a string?
	- A null terminated character array
- A null character `\0` is a character that is used to tell a computer to stop reading more bytes. Like a full stop
	- `"hello"` would really be `"hello\0"`
- Some basic string functions:

```c
strcpy(dest, src);       .. // copies the `src` into the `dest`
strncpy(dest, src, n);      // same as above but up to `n` bytes
strdup(const char * s);     // dynamic allocation of a string (returns add)
strcat(dest, src);          // concatenates src to the end of dest
```


## INodes
- Unix is based on INodes
- An INode is a data structure which stores information about a file

```bash
df
stat
```

- `df` tells us about the avaiable disk space, including the number of inodes
- `stat` gives detailed information about the device, mode, INODE! and access modifiers

### INodes and the File System
- In Unix, the file system is divided into three parts
	1. The Super Block: Contains a bunch of general information ( similar in all installations of linux )
	2. The INode Table: a table of INodes
	3. Data: The stuff and thangs you store, like a movie and it's data (think gigabytes)

- How is an INode associated with data?
- First have to answer what an INode exactly is:
	- INodes have attributes and references to blocks
	- A block is a bit data in another block
- The file system knows where data is though `indirect blocks`
- An INode points at in indirect block which itself points at data

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319231435.png]]

- Takeaway: Indirect blocks allow INodes to cover larger amounts of data compared to direct references or normal blocks

## Access Modifiers
- `stat` shows three timestamps for `access, modify, change`
