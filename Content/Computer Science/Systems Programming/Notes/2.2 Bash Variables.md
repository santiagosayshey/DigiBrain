# Variables

- Define variables without whitespace

```bash
a=1
```

NOT

```bash
a = 1
```

- Bash will inteperet this as calling the function 'a' with parameters '=' and '1'
- Bash is not strictly typed, any type can be assigned to any variable withing assigning its type first

## Strings

- Whitespace only allowed in the string itself
- Can be used with single or double apostrophes
- echo will print whatever is in single quotes ( it wont interpret it)

```bash
string="This is a string"
```

```bash
a=“quack” 
echo '$a$a'           > $a$a
echo $a$a             > quackquack 
echo “${a}s”          > quacks 
echo “${a:1:4}”       > uac
```

## Arrays

- Defines arrays inside circle brackets with proper whitespace (regular whitespace needed outside of bracket)
- Space seperates each element

```bash
array=( A B C D E F G )
```

- Access values like this:

```bash
b=${a[0]}
```

- Assign the first element of 'a' into another variable 'b'

- Other Operations
| a[0]=5     | Assignment operator          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| ${arr[@]}  | Get all elements             |
| ${arr[@]}  | Get array indicies           |
| ${#arr[@]} | Get Length of Array          |
| a+=(value) | Append value to the end of a |
|    ${a[@]:i:j}        | Get the values from index i through index j                             |

## Exporting Variables

script1.sh 
```bash
a=5 
./script2.sh  
```
script2.sh
```bash
echo $a
```

- This will not work because 'a' is not within the scope when calling script 2
-  To fix this, we can `export` a before calling script2

script1.sh 
```bash
a=5
export a
./script2.sh  
```
script2.sh
```bash
echo $a
```

- script 2 will now print a

# Redirection

- Use the `read` function to take input and store them in variables

```bash
read a b
```

- This will prompt the user to type something
- The first 'word' (set of connected characters) will be saved into 'a'
- The rest will be saved into 'b'

- We can input `<` into functions such as `wc` 

```bash
wc < input_file.txt
```

- This will count the lines in 'input_file.txt'
- We can also take the output of `wc` and direct that into another file to save it

```bash
wc < input_file.txt > output_file.txt
```

- `>` will overrite the file, `>>` will append to it

```bash
wc >> output_file.txt
```


## Pipes

- We can `pipe` the output of one function into another function using `|`

```bash
ls | wc -l
```

- This will output all the files in the current directory, pipe that to the word count function and then output the number of lines

## Here Strings

- We can pass the output of the RHS into the LHS using `<<<`

```bash
cat <<< $(ls) 
cat <<< $(wc test_input.txt)
```

- Combining this with the `read` function

```bash
read lines words chars filename <<< $(wc test_input.txt)
```

- Since wc will output different things per 'word', each will be saved into their respective variable from read

```bash
echo $lines       # Prints the number of lines 
echo $words       # Prints the number of words 
echo $chars       # Prints the number of characters 
echo $filename    # Prints the filename
```
