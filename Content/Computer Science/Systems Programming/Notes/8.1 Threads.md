## ps & kill

```bash
ps -a
```

- Outputs all processes currently runnong on the machine
	- Process ID
	- Who is running it
	- When it started
	- What it's called

```bash
kill process ID
```

- Will end a process with specific process ID

```bash
kill -kill // will force quit a process
kill -TERM, -STOP, -CONT
// others to ask programs to shutdown by themselves

# 'CTRl-Z' is a short hand for 
kill -STOP // pause a process
```

## Jobs
- Works well with `fg` and `bg`, short for foreground and background
- Adding `&` to a process will allow it to run in the background (lets you use the terminal)
- `fg` will allow you to bring a background program back to the foreground

```bash
programNumber & // runs in the background
fg programNumber // returns programNumber back to foreground
CTRL-Z will pause programNumber, then bg will send it to the background

```

- `jobs` will return the number needed to perform `bg & fg` commands

## Threads
- Share memory
	- Both 'threads' are running in the same memory context and have the same heap, data and code bit of memory to talk to
	- Processes on the other hand, will have seperate memory allocated to them 
- Two threads have the same process ID

### Stack
- Each thread has it's own stack, despite sharing memory
- The stack is essentially, the current running program
- In multithreaded programs, the program keeps track of two stacks, each of which defines the execution of each thread

### Threads in C

#### Includes and Compilation

```c
#include <pthread.h>
```

```bash
gcc -pthread -o “my_exe” file1.c file2.c
```

- Flag tells the compiler that threads are happening

#### Making the Thread

```c
pthread_create(tptr, attrptr, func_ptr, arg_ptr)
```

- `tptr`
	- Name of new thread
	- Before calling pthread_create, you have to have a variable of type `pthread`. this allows c to know which thread you want to talk to
- `attptr`
	- dont worry about it cuz
- `func_ptr`
	- The function where the thread starts ( kind of like the main function for a program )
	- Must return a void pointer (void \*)
- `arg_ptr`
	- Parameters passed to `func_ptr`
	- Must be a single void pointer (void \*)
		- Just a stand in for whatever you want

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

// Function that will be executed by the threads
void* print_message(void* arg) {
    char* message = (char*) arg;
    printf("%s\n", message);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread1, thread2;
    char* message1 = "Hello from Thread 1";
    char* message2 = "Hello from Thread 2";

    // Create the threads
    pthread_create(&thread1, NULL, print_message, (void*) message1);
    pthread_create(&thread2, NULL, print_message, (void*) message2);

    // Wait for the threads to finish
    pthread_join(thread1, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread2, NULL);

    printf("Both threads have completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```


```sh
gcc -o simple_thread simple_thread.c -lpthread
./simple_thread

# Hello from Thread 1
# Hello from Thread 2
# Both threads have completed.
```

### Problems with Threads

#### Shared Memory
- Via pointers can access shared variables between threads
- This creates issues with handover ( one thead incorrectly passes a variable to another thread )
- For example
	- What if i wanted to perform a calculation where an acceleration is used to update the position commands on an aircraft
	- The first thread is dealyed, the second thread reads an out of data value, causes the aircraft to make bad calculations and crash
- Consider the following function

```c
void increment() {
	x++;
}
```

- If thread A called this 100 times and thread B called this 50 times, x isn't guaranteed to be 150

```
Scenario 1
A) Accesses ‘x’ (x is zero)
A) Increments ‘x’ (temporary value is x + 1)
A) Writes new ‘x’ (x + 1)
B) Accesses ‘x’ (x is x+1)
B) Increments ‘x’ (temporary value is x + 2)
B) Writes new ‘x’ (x + 2)

Scenario 2
A) Accesses ‘x’ (x is zero)
B) Accesses ‘x’ (x is still zero)
A) Increments ‘x’ (temporary value is x + 1)
B) Increments ‘x’ (temporary value is x + 1)
A) Writes new ‘x’ (x + 1)
B) Writes new ‘x’ (x + 1)
```

- In other words, the order in which the operation A writes and B reads can change the outcome, this is called **race condition**

#### Race Condition
- When two independant tasks produce different results depending on the timing of how those two tasks are implemented

### Solving Race Conditions with Mutexes
- Mutex stands for Mutual Exclusive
- Is a resource designed to be fundamentally singular in it's existence (only 1 thread can have it at a time)
	- If there is a bit of shared memory, the current thread with the mutex can change that memory
	- Other threads must wait until they have the mutex
	- This also means that threads need to wait for each other (which kind of defeats the purpose)

#### Mutex Example

```c
// initalised as
pthread_mutex_t my_mutex;

// has functions:
pthread_mutex_lock(&my_mutex); // take function for yourself
pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_mutex); // allow others to use function
```

### Producers and Consumers
- A program architecture that encourages multithreading
- Making something is a lot more effort than using it (sometimes), threads are useful for this
- 10 threads could be used to say, cook eggs, and a single thread could be used to consume those eggs
- Timing is difficult to get right, we use a signal to determine when something is ready

#### Signals and Mutexes
- How do you know if memory has been written to?
- After someone reads from shared memory, they reset it to 0 to signal that it has been rtead from and is ready for further writing

```c
pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &lock)
```

- The thread which is read from shared memory needs to wait for the data to be populated
- The data is associated with a mutex `&lock` and a condition `&cond`
- The consumer must first have the mutex in order to call this function
- Calling this function unlocks the mutex ( and allow the producer to interact with the memory )
- Once the producer has done it's task - lock the mutex, change data, etc, we signal the consumer

```c
pthread_cond_signal(&cond)
```

- This will 'wake up' the consumer (waiting thread), and make it try to reaquire the mutex


### Thread Order of Operations
![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230501050943.png]]

#### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 5

// Food buffer
int buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
int count = 0;

// Mutex and condition variables
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t food_available = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t space_available = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

// Cook (producer) function
void* cook(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

        // Wait for space to be available in the buffer
        while (count == BUFFER_SIZE) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&space_available, &mutex);
        }

        // Cook food and add it to the buffer
        buffer[count++] = i;
        printf("Cooked food #%d\n", i);

        // Signal that food is available
        pthread_cond_signal(&food_available);

        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        sleep(1); // Simulate cooking time
    }

    return NULL;
}

// Customer (consumer) function
void* customer(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

        // Wait for food to be available in the buffer
        while (count == 0) {
            pthread_cond_wait(&food_available, &mutex);
        }

        // Remove food from the buffer and consume it
        int food = buffer[--count];
        printf("Consumed food #%d\n", food);

        // Signal that space is available
        pthread_cond_signal(&space_available);

        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        sleep(2); // Simulate eating time
    }

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t cook_thread, customer_thread;

    // Create the cook and customer threads
    pthread_create(&cook_thread, NULL, cook, NULL);
    pthread_create(&customer_thread, NULL, customer, NULL);

    // Wait for the threads to finish
    pthread_join(cook_thread, NULL);
    pthread_join(customer_thread, NULL);

    printf("Cooking and consuming have completed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Terminating Threads
- In a regular program, the main function will return 0 once it's finished
- Threads are different, in that the final thread must know that all other threads are also finished and end itself
- Threads can end by running out of code to execute, or manually using:

```c
pthread_exit
```

- Explicitly ending a thread like this sends an exit status which can be picked up, and processed to tell another thread something

```c
pthread_cancel()
```

- This is usually when a main thread decides to abruptly end another thrread in process

- Threads can also die if the main thread dies (like parent - child functions)

### Joining Threads
- Another useful thing to do when a thread ends, is tell the main thread it has ended

```c
pthread_join(, void ** <retval>).
```

- This function will cause the main thread to wait until the specified thread has exited (ended by itself)
- The return value is given as a pointer to the main thread to determine an exist status

### Thread Attributes
- Recall - `attptr`, the second paramter of the `pthread_create` function
- Allows threads to behave differently (like flags in a bash command)
	- Can be detached ( not joinable )
		- This means once it ends, nothing is waiting on it so it releases all its resources immediately
	- Order in which threads are managed
		- FIFO, round-robin, etc
