# C++ vs C
- They're not the same outside of syntax
- C++ is more than 'C with objects'
## Booleans
- Values that contain true or false
- Do not exist in C, outside of using `int` or a boolean library
- Everything outside of 0 is true

```c
if (27)
{
	// do stuff
}
```

- Is the same as 

```cpp
if (true)
{
	// do stuff
}
```

## Casting

```cpp
float a = 1.5;
int b - int(a);
```

- Very useful in c++
- Dangerous
	- Largest integer smaller than largest float
	- Sometimes does not preserve sign ( not all types can be negative )
- Can cast pointers
	- Relevant when the compiler needs to know how to interpret the bits in the adress
	- Size matters, iterating through a dereferenced pointer array of say, ints will be different if you cast those ints to floats

# Memory Allocation
- No more `new` and `delete`

```c
// instead of new, we have
malloc
calloc
realloc

// instead of delete, we have
free
```

## Malloc

```C
int* a = (int*)(malloc(10*sizeof(int)));
// allocates 10 ints worth of memory
```

- Need to use `sizeof` as size of ints is different in different operating systems
- We need to cast maloc to a type we care about, use `int*` to cast it to a pointer to an integer

## Calloc

```c
int* a = (int*)(calloc(10,sizeof(int)))
```
- Presets the data assigned to the address to 0, as opposed to `malloc` which keeps the previous data
- Slower than `malloc` as it needs to do this calculation to wipe the memory

## Realloc

```c
void* realloc (void* ptr, size_t size)
```

- Returns a void pointer because the ptr you give to it will be used to reallocate to that type of pointer
- Realloc allows you to extend a previous memory address, rather than deleting the previous one and making a new, bigger one

## Free

```c
free(my_ptr)
```

- Will deallocate the memory just as you would with delete
