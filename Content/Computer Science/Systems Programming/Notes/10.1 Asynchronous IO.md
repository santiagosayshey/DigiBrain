## Synchronous vs Asynchronous IO
- Standard Input and Output are examples of synchronous IO
- We know this because the program waits for the functions to finish before it proceeds with the remaining code
	- If you don't provide an EOF character, the process will hang froever

- With synchronous IO, these actions can occur seperate from any othe actions
	- Example:
		- Typing in the search bar will not pause a video you were watching
- The idea is that with synchronous IO, the program is happy to accept input at any time without interrupting its other processes

### Server Example

![[docs/Images/Screenshot 2023-05-21 at 4.14.14 pm.png]]

- How do we know when the client or server is able to take on more information to process?
- At the very least, a buffer structure is needed to keep track of events

#### Level Tracking vs Edge Tracking
- Two effective ways of keeping track of things

##### Level Tracking
- Keep a list of everything
- Each thing in existence is in a list and its state is stored in that list
- Downsides:
	- Huge List
	- Need to search through entire thing to ask about elements


##### Edge tracking
- Only ever track the changes of things

### Ok, But How Do We Implement Asynchronous IO?

#### Solution #1: Threads
- duh
- One for doing stuff, another for taking input
	- Use mutexes, waits and signals
- Not really duh
	- Creates a large overhead
	- Lots of memory, switching between threads is costly
	- Not all processors can do multi threading
	- Debugging a large multi threaded program is NOT fun

#### Solution #2: Signals
- Properly asynchronous
- Can detect segfaults, errors, etc
	- How about IO?

##### Normal IO (Without Signals)
- Waits for the user to interact
- The program interferes with some characters
- The program waits for its return signal

##### SIGIO
- Sent when a file descriptor is ready to perform input or output
- Disabled by default but once active, can detect all kinds of things
- Need to deal with automated terminal behaviour through **fcntl**

###### fcntl -Control

```c
#include <fcntrl>

// usage
int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ...);
```

- `fd` refers to a file description and `cmd` refers to a thing you want to do with the fil descriptor

- `F_SETFL` is a command used to set flags for `fcntl`
	- We need to use `O_ASYNC`
	- In order to allow a file descriptor to send `SIGIO` signals, it must first be set to `O_ASYNC`
		- Like so:

```c
fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid()); 
int fd_flags = fcntl(0, F_GETFL); 
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, (fd_flags | O_ASYNC);
```

- Set the owner
	- This is needed to link the file descriptor to the processed destined to recieve `SIGIO` signal changes from the dile descriptor
- Get existing flags
- Set the flag you want using `(old_flag | new_flag)` syntax

###### STTY
- Used to interact with the terminal commands
- I.e. removing the ability to echo (displaying what you type)

```c
system('stty raw -echo');
system('stty cooked +echo');
```

- This can be done:
	- On an adhoc basis
	- Manually, prior to the programming being called (and then turn off after)
	- Using `system` as above
	- Using C functions

##### POSIX
- Does the same thing as `SIGIO`, but is more robust (has more options)

###### Compiler Flags
- `-lrt` 

###### The Process
- Same. Redirect SIGIO and set STTY => RAW

###### Giant Structs
- The special methods usually include giant structs

```c
struct aiocb { 
	int aio_fildes                   // file descriptor 
	off_t aio_offset                 // file offset 
	volatile void *aio_buf           // pointer to a buffer : ) 
	size_t aio_nbytes                // length of a transfer 
	int aio_reqprio                  // request priority offset 
	struct sigevent aio_sigevent     // a sigeventâ€¦ 
	int aio_lio_opcode               // operation to be performed 
}
```

## Implementation in C
- Need to use `aiocb` struct (called `my_buffer`)
- Need to have an input (reading one at a time)
- Because reading from `stdin`, we choose `.aio_fildes = 0`

```c
struct aiocb my_buffer;

setup()
{
	static char input[1];
	my_buffer.aio_fildes = 0;                            // Stdin (i.e. fd = 0) 
	my_buffer.aio_buf = input; my_buffer.aio_nbytes = 1; // See input
	my_buffer.aio_offset = 0;                            // Offset in file (header?)
	my_buffer.aio_sigevent.sigev_notify                  = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
	my_buffer.aio_sigevent.sigev_signo                   = SIGIO;
}
```

- Now we need to connect it via `aio_read`

```c
aio_read(&my_buffer);
```

- Setup the signal for redirection

```c
signal(SIGIO, signal_handling_function);
```

- To deal with the buffer inside of the handler, we can:
	- Handle errors via:

```c
aio_error(&my_buffer) != 0;
```

- This can be used in a standard if statement like making pipes and threads, etc
- Then we need to get the actual characters via:

```c
aio_return(&my_buffer);
```

- This only reads the characters though, to get them we use a `convenience pointer`
- The character typed into `stdin` is now available in memory

```c
char* character_pointer = char* my_buffer.aio_buf
```

- Now make a new reqyest at the end of the handler via:

```c
aio_read(&my_buffer);
```

### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <aio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define SIZE 100

// aiocb struct instance
struct aiocb my_aiocb;

// Signal handling function
void handle_input(int signo) {
    if (aio_error(&my_aiocb) == 0) {
        int bytes = aio_return(&my_aiocb);
        if(bytes > 0){
            printf("Read: %s\n", (char*)my_aiocb.aio_buf);
        }
    }

    // Prepare for next read
    aio_read(&my_aiocb);
}

void setup_aio_buffer() {
    static char input[SIZE+1];

    // Clear out the struct
    bzero((char *)&my_aiocb, sizeof(struct aiocb));

    my_aiocb.aio_buf = input;
    my_aiocb.aio_fildes = STDIN_FILENO;
    my_aiocb.aio_nbytes = SIZE;
    my_aiocb.aio_offset = 0;

    my_aiocb.aio_sigevent.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
    my_aiocb.aio_sigevent.sigev_signo = SIGIO;
    my_aiocb.aio_sigevent.sigev_value.sival_ptr = &my_aiocb;

    // Link the signal to the signal handling function
    signal(SIGIO, handle_input);
}

int main() {
    setup_aio_buffer();
    aio_read(&my_aiocb);

    // Do other work here...
    while (1) {
        pause();
    }
}
```

## Strace
- Signal Trace
- Intercepts and records system calls which are called by a process and the signals receieved by the process

```console
strace ./my_exe
```

### With Forks

```console
strace ./my_exe -f
```
