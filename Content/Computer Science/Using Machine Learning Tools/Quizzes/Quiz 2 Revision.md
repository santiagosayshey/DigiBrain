| True Positive               | TP           | All the data labelled as postitive that was actually positive                                                                                                                                                            |         |

| True Negative               | TN           | All the data labelled as negative that was actually negative                                                                                                                                                             |         |
| Precision                   | P            | What fraction of positive predictions are correct?<br>$$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$<br>- Important when false positives are costly (like identifying an important email as spam)                             |         |
| Recall (True Positive Rate) | R or TPR     | What fraction of the real positive class was detected?<br>$$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$<br>- Important when missing positive cases is costly (like missing cancer in someone that has it)                       |         |
| False Positive Rate         | FPR          | What fraction of the real negative class was incorrectly labeled as positive? $$\text{FPR} = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}$$ - Important when false alarms are costly (like incorrectly flagging a legitimate transaction as fraud) |         |
| F1-Score                    | F1-Score     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |
