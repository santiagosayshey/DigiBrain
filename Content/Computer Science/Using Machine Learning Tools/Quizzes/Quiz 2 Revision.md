| False Positive                  | FP           | All the data labelled as positive but was actually negative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |         |

| True Positive Rate (Recall)     | TPR          | Of all the **actually positive cases**, how many were correctly identified as positive?<br>- All positive cases is $TP + FN$<br>- So, TPR is $TP/(TP+FN)$<br>- Useful when missing positives can be really bad (cancer screening, fraud detection)                                                       |         |
| False Positive Rate (Precision) | FPR          | Of all the identified positive cases (whether right or wrong), how many were correctly identified as positive<br>- All identified positive cases is $TP + FP$<br>- So, FPR is $TP/(TP+FP)$<br>- Useful when identifying negatives as positives can be really bad (spam filtering, targeted advertisting) |         |
