> [!motivation] The Challenge of Unlabeled Data
> 
> A significant portion of available data **exists without corresponding labels.** While input features (X) are often abundant, the associated output labels (y) required for supervised learning are frequently missing.
> 
> - Labeling data typically requires manual effort, which can be costly and time-intensive.
> - Consider a manufacturing scenario: automatically capturing thousands of product images daily is feasible, but labeling each as "defective" or "normal" requires expert review.
> - This process limits the size of labeled datasets, potentially impacting the performance of supervised models.
> - Changes to products necessitate relabeling, adding further overhead.
> 
> The challenge lies in effectively utilizing the vast amounts of available unlabeled data without incurring the high costs associated with manual labeling.
