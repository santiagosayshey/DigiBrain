> [!motivation] The Challenge of Unlabeled Data
> 
> A significant portion of available data **exists without corresponding labels.** While input features (X) are often abundant, the associated output labels (y) required for supervised learning are frequently missing.
> 
> - Labeling data typically requires manual effort, which can be costly and time-intensive.
> - Consider a manufacturing scenario: automatically capturing thousands of product images daily is feasible, but labeling each as "defective" or "normal" requires expert review.
> - This process limits the size of labeled datasets, potentially impacting the performance of supervised models.
> - Changes to products necessitate relabeling, adding further overhead.
> 
> The challenge lies in effectively **utilizing the vast amounts of available unlabeled data without incurring the high costs associated with manual labeling.**

> [!idea] Unsupervised Learning
> 
> Unsupervised learning algorithms **analyze datasets that do not contain predefined labels or output variables (y).** The primary goal is to discover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships directly from the input data (X).
> 
> Key unsupervised learning tasks include:
> 
> - **Clustering**: This task aims to group similar data instances together into clusters. It is often used for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems, and image segmentation.
> - **Anomaly Detection**: The objective here is to identify instances that deviate significantly from what is considered "normal" data. Common applications include fraud detection and finding defective items.
> - **Density Estimation**: This task focuses on modeling the distribution of data points in the feature space. It estimates how likely it is to find a data point in any given region, essentially identifying areas where data is concentrated or sparse. This estimation is useful for anomaly detection (points in very low-density regions are likely anomalies), data analysis, and visualization.
> 
> These techniques enable the exploration and understanding of data structure without relying on pre-existing labels.
