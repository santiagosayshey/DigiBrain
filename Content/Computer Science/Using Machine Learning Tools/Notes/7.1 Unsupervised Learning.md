> [!motivation] The Challenge of Unlabeled Data
> 
> A significant portion of available data **exists without corresponding labels.** While input features (X) are often abundant, the associated output labels (y) required for supervised learning are frequently missing.
> 
> - Labeling data typically requires manual effort, which can be costly and time-intensive.
> - Consider a manufacturing scenario: automatically capturing thousands of product images daily is feasible, but labeling each as "defective" or "normal" requires expert review.
> - This process limits the size of labeled datasets, potentially impacting the performance of supervised models.
> - Changes to products necessitate relabeling, adding further overhead.
> 
> The challenge lies in effectively **utilizing the vast amounts of available unlabeled data without incurring the high costs associated with manual labeling.**

> [!idea] Unsupervised Learning
> 
> Unsupervised learning algorithms analyze datasets that do not contain predefined labels or output variables (y). The primary goal is to discover inherent patterns, structures, or relationships directly from the input data (X).
> 
> Key unsupervised learning tasks include:
> 
> - **Clustering**: This task aims to group similar data instances together into clusters. It is often used for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems, and image segmentation.
> - **Anomaly Detection**: The objective here is to identify instances that deviate significantly from what is considered "normal" data. Common applications include fraud detection and finding defective items.
> - **Density Estimation**: This involves estimating the underlying probability density function (PDF) from which the dataset was generated. It is useful for anomaly detection (instances in low-density areas are potential anomalies), data analysis, and visualization.
> 
> These techniques enable the exploration and understanding of data structure without relying on pre-existing labels.
