> [!motivation] Static Programs
> 
> Traditional software development relies on rigid, rule-based programs with explicitly coded logic.
> 
> When requirements change:
> 
> - Developers must manually update code
> - New edge cases require additional rules
> - Complexity increases exponentially with program size
> - Testing and validation cycles become lengthy
> 
> This approach becomes unsustainable as applications scale or operate in dynamic environments. **Systems break when encountering scenarios not explicitly programmed for,** leading to maintenance debt and reduced adaptability.

> [!idea] Machine Learning
> 
> Machine learning enables computers to **learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.**
> 
> **Core concept:** Systems **derive rules automatically from examples rather than following pre-defined instructions.**
> 
> How it addresses static program limitations:
> 
> - Adapts to new patterns without code rewrites
> - Generalizes to unseen examples
> - Handles complexity through probabilistic approaches
> - Updates behavior by training on new data
> 
> Machine learning shifts the paradigm from "tell the computer what to do" to **"show the computer what good outcomes look like"** and letting it determine the optimal approach.

> [!consider] The "Teach a Man to Fish" Analogy
> 
> The proverb "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime" parallels the shift from static programming to machine learning.
> 
> **Static Programming** = Giving a fish
> 
> - Solves specific problems with direct solutions
> - Requires new code for each new scenario
> 
> **Machine Learning** = Teaching to fish
> 
> - Provides frameworks for solving classes of problems
> - System continues to improve with experience
> - Adapts to changing conditions without constant intervention
> 
> This analogy highlights why machine learning offers more sustainable solutions for complex, evolving problem spaces where explicit programming would be impractical.
