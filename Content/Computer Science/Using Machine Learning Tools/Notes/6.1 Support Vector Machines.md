> [!motivation] Classification Challenges
> 
> Machine learning models face different challenges depending on dataset size.
> 
> - **Small datasets**: Many complex models struggle with limited training examples, leading to poor generalization
> - **Decision boundaries**: Finding optimal separation between classes becomes critical when working with limited data
> - **Computational scaling**: Models that perform well on smaller datasets often scale poorly as data volume increases
> 
> The ideal classifier would maintain high accuracy with limited training examples while providing clear, interpretable decision boundaries that can handle both linearly and non-linearly separable data.
