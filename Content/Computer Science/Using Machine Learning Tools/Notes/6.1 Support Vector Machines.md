> [!motivation] Classification Challenges
> 
> Machine learning models face different challenges depending on dataset size.
> 
> - **Small datasets**: Many complex models struggle with limited training examples, leading to poor generalization
> - **Decision boundaries**: Finding optimal separation between classes becomes critical when working with limited data
> - **Computational scaling**: Models that perform well on smaller datasets often scale poorly as data volume increases
> 
> The ideal classifier would maintain high accuracy with limited training examples while providing clear, interpretable decision boundaries that can handle both linearly and non-linearly separable data.

> Left image: Problems with standard linear classifiers
> - Dashed line: Completely fails to separate classes (misclassifies blue points)
> - Red line: Separates classes but runs too close to yellow points
> - Purple line: Separates classes but runs too close to blue points
> - Both red and purple boundaries would likely fail with new data points
> 
> Right image: SVM classifier advantage
> - Solid line: Optimal decision boundary that maximizes distance to both classes
> - Dashed lines: Show the margin boundaries - the "buffer zone" between classes
> - Gray circles: Support vectors - the critical points that define the boundary

> Why standard classifiers fail:
> 
> - They simply aim to separate classes without considering proximity to data points
> - When new data arrives with slight variations, these models often misclassify
> - Their decision boundaries lack robustness against noise
> 
> Why SVMs excel:
> 
> - The maximum margin provides optimal separation that's most resistant to new data variations
> - By maximizing the distance to the closest points from each class, SVMs create a buffer zone
> - This approach performs better with limited training data as it focuses on boundary structure rather than trying to model the entire data distribution
