> [!motivation] Classification Challenges
> 
> Machine learning models face different challenges depending on dataset size.
> 
> - **Small datasets**: Many complex models struggle with limited training examples, leading to poor generalization
> - **Decision boundaries**: Finding optimal separation between classes becomes critical when working with limited data
> - **Computational scaling**: Models that perform well on smaller datasets often scale poorly as data volume increases
> 
> The ideal classifier would maintain high accuracy with limited training examples while providing clear, interpretable decision boundaries that can handle both linearly and non-linearly separable data.


> [!example] Maximum Margin Classification
> 
> The iris dataset visualization shows why SVM's maximum margin approach works better than standard linear classifiers.

> **Standard linear classifiers (left image):**
> 
> - Green dashed line fails completely - doesn't separate classes
> - Red and purple lines separate classes but with minimal safety margin
> - Close boundaries mean high risk of misclassification with new data
> 
> **SVM classifier (right image):**
> 
> - Creates maximum-width "street" between classes (shown by dashed margin lines)
> - Only needs support vectors (gray circled points) to define the boundary
> - Maintains optimal distance from both classes
> 
> This visual comparison demonstrates why SVMs perform better with smaller datasets. By focusing on boundary optimization rather than distribution modeling, they generalize more effectively from limited examples.
