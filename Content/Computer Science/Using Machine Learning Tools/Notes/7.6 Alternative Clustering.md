> [!consider] Alternative Clustering Algorithms
>
> Beyond K-Means and DBSCAN, Scikit-Learn offers several other clustering algorithms, each suited to different situations:
>
> * **Agglomerative Clustering**:
>     * **Mechanism**: Builds a hierarchy from the bottom up by iteratively merging the closest pair of clusters, starting with individual instances.
>     * **Output**: Creates a cluster tree (dendrogram), offering flexibility.
>     * **Characteristics**: Handles various cluster shapes and distance metrics. Scalability depends on using a connectivity matrix; otherwise inefficient for large datasets.
>
> * **BIRCH** (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies):
>     * **Use Case**: Designed for very large datasets, especially with fewer features (<20).
>     * **Mechanism**: Uses a memory-efficient tree structure (CF-Tree) to summarize data.
>     * **Characteristics**: Can be faster than K-Means on large, low-dimensional datasets.
>
> * **Mean-Shift**:
>     * **Mechanism**: Iteratively shifts circles ('kernels') placed on data points towards the local mean of points within them, settling at density peaks. Points whose circles converge together form clusters.
>     * **Characteristics**: Finds arbitrary shapes without needing $k$ specified (uses `bandwidth` parameter). Can segment clusters with internal density variations. Does not scale well computationally.
>
> * **Affinity Propagation**:
>     * **Mechanism**: Instances exchange messages to "elect" representative instances (exemplars). Clusters are formed by an exemplar and the instances that elected it.
>     * **Characteristics**: Does not require $k$ to be specified. Handles different cluster sizes well. Tends to choose central exemplars. Does not scale well to large datasets due to computational complexity.
>
> * **Spectral Clustering**:
>     * **Mechanism**: Uses a similarity matrix between instances to create a low-dimensional embedding, then applies another clustering algorithm (like K-Means) in this reduced space.
>     * **Characteristics**: Can capture complex cluster structures and cut graphs (like social networks). Does not scale well to large datasets and performs poorly if clusters have very different sizes.
>
> Evaluating these alternatives can be useful when K-Means or DBSCAN assumptions don't fit the data well.
