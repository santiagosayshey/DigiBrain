> **Making sense of data often requires grouping similar items together**. Imagine you have thousands of emails - some are spam, others are important business communications. How do you automatically sort them?
> 
> Similarly, consider:
> 
> - Medical diagnostics: Is this cell malignant or benign?
> - Customer behavior: Will this customer churn or stay?
> - Image recognition: Is this image a cat or a dog?
> 
> In each case, we need to assign items to discrete categories based on their characteristics. This assignment process needs to be:
> 
> - Accurate
> - Scalable
> - Consistent

> [!idea] Classification
> 
> Classification is a supervised learning technique that predicts which category an observation belongs to based on labeled training data.
> 
> **How it works:**
> 
> - The algorithm learns from labeled examples (training data)
> - It identifies patterns that distinguish different classes
> - When given new data, it assigns the most likely category
> 
> **Types of classification problems:**
> 
> - Binary classification: two possible outcomes (spam/not spam)
> - Multi-class classification: three or more discrete categories (cat/dog/horse)
> - Multi-label classification: each instance can belong to multiple categories simultaneously
> 
> **Common classification algorithms:**
> 
> |Algorithm|Strengths|Typical Applications|
> |---|---|---|
> |Logistic Regression|Simple, interpretable|Binary outcomes, risk scoring|
> |Decision Trees|Handles non-linear data, interpretable|Rule-based decisions|
> |Random Forest|Resistant to overfitting, handles missing values|Complex classification tasks|
> |Support Vector Machines|Effective in high-dimensional spaces|Text classification, image recognition|
> |Neural Networks|Captures complex patterns|Image, speech, and natural language processing|
