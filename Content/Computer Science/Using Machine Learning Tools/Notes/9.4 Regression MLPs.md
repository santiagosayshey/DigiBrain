> [!motivation] Motivation: Predicting Values, Not Just Categories
>
> We've explored the architecture of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and how they can learn complex patterns through mechanisms like backpropagation. Much of the discussion implicitly focused on classification tasksâ€”assigning an input to a discrete category (like "cat" vs. "dog", "spam" vs. "not spam", or different Iris species).
>
> However, many important real-world problems involve predicting a **continuous numerical value**, rather than a category label. Consider tasks such as:
> -   Estimating the future price of a stock based on market trends.
> -   Predicting the exact temperature for tomorrow based on current weather data.
> -   Calculating the expected sale price of a house given its features (size, location, condition).
> -   Determining the fuel efficiency (e.g., miles per gallon) of a car based on its engine size, weight, and aerodynamics.
> -   Estimating the age of a person from their photograph.
>
> These problems require a model to output a specific number along a continuous scale. This raises the question: how can the powerful pattern-recognition capabilities of MLPs, which excel at learning complex functions, be adapted or configured to tackle these **regression tasks** where the goal is precise numerical prediction?
