> 
> Supervised learning **trains models on labeled data (input-output pairs) to predict outputs for new inputs.**
> 
> **Two primary types:**
> 
> |Type|Purpose|Output|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Classification|Predicts which discrete category an input belongs to|Discrete label from a finite set (e.g., "yes"/"no", "cat"/"dog"/"bird")|Email filter that decides if a message belongs to "spam," "primary," or "promotions" categories based on content and sender information|
> |Regression|Predicts a continuous numerical value on a scale|Any real number within a range (e.g., $250,321 or 98.6Â°F)|House price predictor that takes features like location, square footage, and age to output an exact dollar amount ($472,890) rather than a price category|
> 
> **Key difference:**
> 
> - Classification divides inputs into separate, distinct groups (like sorting objects into labeled boxes)
> - Regression places inputs on a continuous spectrum (like measuring position on a number line)
> 
> 
> **Process:**
> 
> - Model is trained on labeled examples
> - Learning algorithm finds patterns connecting inputs to outputs
> - Model performance is evaluated on held-out test data

> [!idea] Unsupervised Learning
> 
> Unsupervised learning **finds patterns in data without labeled outputs or predefined categories.** The algorithm must discover structure on its own.
> 
> **Three main types:**
> 
> |Type|Purpose|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Clustering|Groups similar data points based on inherent similarities|Customer segmentation system that analyzes purchase history and browsing behavior to identify natural customer groups (like "budget shoppers," "luxury buyers," and "seasonal purchasers") without predefined categories|
> |Dimension Reduction|Compresses data to fewer dimensions while preserving important information|Image processing system that takes 1000-pixel images and reduces them to 50 key features that capture the same visual information, making pattern recognition faster without significant loss of accuracy|
> |Anomaly Detection|Identifies unusual patterns that don't conform to expected behavior|Credit card fraud detection system that learns normal spending patterns and flags transactions that deviate significantly, like unusual locations or purchase amounts, without being explicitly told what fraud looks like|
> 
> **Key characteristics:**
> 
> - Works with unlabeled data where "correct answers" aren't provided
> - Discovers hidden structures or relationships autonomously
> - Often used as a preprocessing step or for exploratory data analysis
> 
> **Common algorithms:**
> 
> - Clustering: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
> - Dimension Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE
> - Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders

> [!idea] Reinforcement Learning
> 
> Reinforcement learning **trains agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback** in the form of rewards or penalties.
> 
> **Key components:**
> 
> |Component|Description|
> |---|---|
> |Agent|The decision-maker that learns through trial and error|
> |Environment|The world in which the agent operates|
> |Actions|Choices the agent can make|
> |States|Different situations the agent can find itself in|
> |Rewards|Numerical feedback signals indicating success or failure|
> |Policy|The strategy that determines which actions to take in which states|
> 
> **Core process:**
> 
> - Agent observes current state of environment
> - Agent selects an action based on its policy
> - Environment transitions to a new state
> - Agent receives a reward signal
> - Agent updates its policy to maximize future rewards
> 
> **Example:** A game-playing AI learns to master chess not through studying labeled examples of good/bad moves, but by playing thousands of games against itself, receiving a positive reward only when it wins, and gradually discovering effective strategies through experimentation.
