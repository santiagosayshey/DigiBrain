> [!motivation] Learning From Nature
> 
> Throughout history, **humans have drawn inspiration from nature to solve complex problems:**
> - The aerodynamic design of birds' wings led to aircraft development
> - The tiny hooks on burdock plant seeds inspired the creation of Velcro
> - The intricate structure of the human brain has guided our quest to build intelligent machines
> 
> As computing tasks grow increasingly complex, traditional programming approaches face limitations. Modern applications require systems that can:
> - Process vast amounts of unstructured data
> - Identify patterns that humans cannot easily define with explicit rules
> - Adapt and improve performance through experience
> 
> This need for more sophisticated computational approaches has driven researchers toward developing systems that **mimic the brain's neural architecture**. These bio-inspired approaches power many familiar technologies:
> - Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa that understand natural language
> - Google Images and similar services that can identify objects in photographs
> - Recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube and Netflix
> - Autonomous vehicles that can perceive and navigate complex environments
