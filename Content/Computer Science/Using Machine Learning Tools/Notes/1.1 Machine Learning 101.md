> [!motivation] From Explicit Algorithms to Learning Systems
> 
> In traditional imperative programming, we explicitly tell computers what to do through step-by-step instructions. We write algorithms that solve specific problems - sorting data, finding paths, or processing text.
> 
> But **what if we could create programs that improve themselves?** Instead of manually coding every solution, what if we could design systems that learn from experience?
> 
> Consider these scenarios:
> 
> - A spam filter that gets better at detection the more emails it processes
> - A recommendation system that improves as it observes user preferences
> - A navigation system that optimizes routes based on traffic patterns
