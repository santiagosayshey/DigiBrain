> [!motivation] Static Programs
> 
> Software traditionally operates through **fixed instructions that define exactly how to process inputs** to generate outputs. This approach **breaks down when facing complex, evolving problems** like image recognition or fraud detection.
> 
> The core limitation is that static programs cannot adapt without human intervention. Every new scenario requires developer time to analyze, code, test and deploy updates. This creates an unbridgeable gap between rapidly changing environments and the software meant to handle them.
> 
> As data volumes grow and patterns become more complex, the "explicitly program everything" approach becomes mathematically impossible. There are simply too many potential scenarios to hard-code solutions for each one.

> [!idea] Machine Learning
> 
> Machine learning is a computational approach where systems learn from data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
