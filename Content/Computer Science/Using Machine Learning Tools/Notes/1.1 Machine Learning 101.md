> [!motivation] Static Programs
> 
> Static programs use **fixed rules and logic defined at development time** to process inputs and produce outputs.
> 
> Traditional programs **break when requirements shift:**
> 
> - Input data formats change
> - Business rules evolve
> - Edge cases emerge
> 
> Each change requires manual code updates by developers, creating a cycle of:
> 
> 1. Identify changed requirements
> 2. Modify program logic
> 3. Test and deploy updates
> 4. Repeat for next change

> [!idea] Machine Learning
> 
> Machine learning **enables programs to learn patterns from data rather than following explicit programming rules.**
> 
> Core mechanics:
> 
> - Programs learn from examples instead of fixed rules
> - Models identify patterns in training data
> - Learned patterns generalize to new, unseen inputs
> 
> |Traditional Programs|Machine Learning|
> |---|---|
> |Fixed logic rules|Learned patterns|
> |Manual updates needed|Adapts from data|
> |Explicit programming|Implicit learning|

> [!idea] Supervised Learning
> 
> Supervised learning trains models using labeled examples to predict outputs for new inputs.
> 
> Two main types:
> 
> - Classification: Predicts discrete categories
>     - Examples: Spam detection, image recognition
> - Regression: Predicts continuous values
>     - Examples: Price prediction, temperature forecasting
