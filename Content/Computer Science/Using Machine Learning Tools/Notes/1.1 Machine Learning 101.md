> [!motivation] Static Programs
> 
> Software traditionally operates through **fixed instructions that define exactly how to process inputs** to generate outputs. This approach **breaks down when facing complex, evolving problems** like image recognition or fraud detection.
> 
> The core limitation is that static programs cannot adapt without human intervention. Every new scenario requires developer time to analyze, code, test and deploy updates. This creates an unbridgeable gap between rapidly changing environments and the software meant to handle them.
> 
> As data volumes grow and patterns become more complex, the "explicitly program everything" approach becomes mathematically impossible. There are simply too many potential scenarios to hard-code solutions for each one.


> [!idea] Machine Learning
> 
> Machine learning is a computational approach where s**ystems learn from data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.**
> 
> Unlike traditional programming where rules are explicitly coded, ML algorithms build mathematical models from sample data (training data) to make predictions or decisions without being specifically programmed for the task. The system learns by analyzing patterns in data and adjusting its model to improve performance over time.
> 
> Key components of machine learning:
> 
> - Training data: Historical examples the system learns from
> - Features: The attributes or properties used for learning
> - Model: The mathematical representation learned from data
> - Inference: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data

> |Name|Type|Description|Example|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |Classification|Supervised Learning|Algorithms that predict which category data belongs to based on labeled examples. Labels are predefined target categories (e.g., "spam" or "not spam") attached to each training example. The algorithm learns to associate patterns in input features with specific labels, then applies these patterns to categorize new, unlabeled data.|Email classification using features like word frequency, sender info, and formatting to determine if an email is "spam" or "not spam"|
> |Regression|Supervised Learning|Algorithms that predict numeric values based on labeled examples. Labels are specific numeric target values (e.g., $250,000 house price) attached to each training example. The algorithm learns mathematical relationships between input features and these numeric labels, then applies these relationships to predict continuous values for new data.|House price prediction using features like square footage, location, number of bedrooms, and age to estimate a specific dollar amount|
