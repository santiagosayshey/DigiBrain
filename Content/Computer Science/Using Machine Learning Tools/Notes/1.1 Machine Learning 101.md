> [!motivation] From Explicit Algorithms to Learning Systems
> 
> In traditional imperative programming, we explicitly tell computers what to do through step-by-step instructions. We write algorithms that solve specific problems - sorting data, finding paths, or processing text.
> 
> But **what if we could create programs that improve themselves?** Instead of manually coding every solution, what if we could design systems that learn from experience?
> 
> Consider these scenarios:
> 
> - A spam filter that gets better at detection the more emails it processes
> - A recommendation system that improves as it observes user preferences
> - A navigation system that optimizes routes based on traffic patterns
> 

> [!idea] Machine Learning
> 
> Machine learning is an approach where **systems learn patterns from data instead of following explicitly programmed instructions.**
> 
> 
> **Learning approaches**:
> 
> - **Supervised**: Learning from labeled examples (input-output pairs)
> - **Unsupervised**: Finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data
> - **Reinforcement**: Learning optimal actions through trial and error

> [!example] Machine Learning in Practice
> 
> **Email Spam Detection**
> 
> A spam filter demonstrates key ML concepts in action:
> 
> 1. **Data collection**: Gathering thousands of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam"
> 2. **Feature extraction**:
>     - Word frequencies (how often "discount" or "free" appear)
>     - Structural elements (ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation!!!)
>     - Metadata (sender reputation, sending server)
> 
> |Feature|Spam Example|Non-Spam Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Contains "FREE!"|Yes (1)|No (0)|
> |All caps percentage|35%|2%|
> |Sender known|No (0)|Yes (1)|
> 
> 1. **Training**: Algorithm learns patterns distinguishing spam from legitimate emails
> 2. **Deployment**: New emails run through the model to predict spam probability
> 3. **Improvement**: System continues learning as users mark incorrectly classified emails
> 
> This example demonstrates how a machine learning system improves over time without explicit programming of every spam pattern - it discovers the patterns itself from data.
