> [!motivation] Static Programs
> 
> Traditional software development relies on static programs with fixed logic.
> 
> When business requirements change, developers must:
> 
> - Modify source code
> - Test changes extensively
> - Deploy updated versions
> - Document modifications
> 
> This cycle becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming as applications grow. For data-intensive problems with frequently changing patterns, this approach is unsustainable because:
> 
> - Solutions quickly become outdated
> - Development costs escalate
> - Implementation time increases
> - Complex patterns may be impossible to code explicitly

> [!idea] Machine Learning
> 
> Machine learning is a computational approach where systems learn from data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
