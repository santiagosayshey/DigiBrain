> [!motivation] Missing Data in Machine Learning
> 
> In real-world datasets, **missing values are common** due to various reasons: data collection errors, non-responses in surveys, or sensor malfunctions.
> 
> Machine learning algorithms typically cannot process data with missing values directly, creating a fundamental problem that needs addressing before any modeling can begin.
> 
> Consider a healthcare dataset with patient records where some test results are missing, or a financial dataset where some transaction details are incomplete - these gaps can significantly impact model performance.

> [!idea] Handling Missing Data
> 
> Missing data handling refers to strategies for addressing incomplete observations in datasets before applying machine learning algorithms.
> 
> Common approaches:
> 
> - **Deletion**: Removing observations or features with missing values
> - **Imputation**: Replacing missing values with estimated values
> - **Using algorithms** that handle missing data natively
> 
> The choice of method depends on:
> 
> - Missing data mechanism (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
> - Amount of missing data
> - Domain-specific constraints

> [!consider] Data Deletion Strategies
> 
> Data deletion involves removing instances or features that contain missing values.
> 
> Types:
> 
> - **Listwise deletion**: Removing entire rows with any missing values
> - **Column deletion**: Removing features with excessive missing values
> 
> Limitations:
> 
> - Loss of potentially valuable information
> - Reduced sample size, affecting statistical power
> - Risk of introducing bias if data isn't missing completely at random
> 
> Best used when missing data percentage is small (<5%) and randomly distributed.

> [!example] Median Imputation
> 
> Median imputation replaces missing values with the median value of the non-missing observations for that feature.
> 
> Implementation steps:
> 
> 1. Calculate the median for each feature with missing values
> 2. Replace missing values with the corresponding median
> 
> Example with a simple dataset:
> 
> |Age|Income|Experience|
> |---|---|---|
> |25|50,000|2|
> |30|??|5|
> |28|45,000|??|
> |35|60,000|8|
> 
> For the Income column:
> 
> - Available values: $50,000, $45,000, $60,000
> - Sorting: $45,000, $50,000, $60,000
> - Median: $50,000 (middle value)
> 
> For the Experience column:
> 
> - Available values: 2, 5, 8
> - Sorting: 2, 5, 8
> - Median: 5 (middle value)
> 
> After median imputation:
> 
> |Age|Income|Experience|
> |---|---|---|
> |25|50,000|2|
> |30|50,000|5|
> |28|45,000|5|
> |35|60,000|8|
> 
> Median imputation maintains the central tendency while being robust to outliers.
