> [!motivation] The Need for Grouping Unlabeled Data
> 
> Humans intuitively group similar objects, like recognizing plants of the same species, even without formal botanical knowledge. This natural ability highlights a common data analysis need.
> 
> - Consider datasets like the Iris dataset shown below. When labels (species) are present (left panel), classification algorithms can assign instances to predefined categories.
> - However, much data lacks these labels (right panel). In such cases, classification methods cannot be applied.
> - The challenge arises: how can we automatically discover inherent groupings within unlabeled data?

> This necessitates methods that can identify structure without supervision.

> [!idea] Clustering
> 
> Clustering is an unsupervised learning task focused on **identifying similar instances within a dataset and assigning them to groups, known as clusters**. Unlike classification, it does not use predefined labels.
> 
> - **Objective**: To partition data such that instances within a cluster are similar to each other, and instances in different clusters are dissimilar.
> - **Algorithm Variability**: Different clustering algorithms define "clusters" differently. Some seek dense regions (DBSCAN), others group around central points (K-Means), and some build hierarchies of clusters.
> - **Feature Utilization**: Algorithms can leverage multiple features, potentially revealing clusters not obvious in lower-dimensional views (like the Iris dataset example).
> 
> Clustering has diverse applications:
> 
> - Customer segmentation for targeted marketing.
> - Exploratory data analysis to understand dataset structure.
> - Dimensionality reduction via cluster affinity vectors.
> - Feature engineering by adding cluster affinity as features.
> - Anomaly detection (outliers often have low affinity to all clusters).
> - Semi-supervised learning by propagating labels within clusters.
> - Search engines for finding similar items (e.g., images).
> - Image segmentation by grouping pixels of similar color.
