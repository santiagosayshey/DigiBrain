> [!motivation] The Problem of Different Feature Scales
> 
> In raw datasets, features naturally exist on vastly different scales - age might be measured in years (20-80), income in dollars (20,000-200,000), and blood pressure in mmHg (80-200).
> 
> These scale disparities create fundamental mathematical issues when calculating distances or gradients, making it difficult to compare or combine features in meaningful ways.
> 
> For example, in a medical dataset, blood tests like white blood cell count (~5-10 K/Î¼L) and cholesterol (~150-300 mg/dL) have different units and ranges, making it unclear how to properly weight their importance in any calculation.

> [!idea] Scaling Data
> 
> Data scaling transforms features to a specific range, ensuring comparability across different scales and improving algorithm performance.
> 
> Common scaling techniques:
> 
> - **Standardization**: Transforms data to have mean=0 and standard deviation=1
> - **Min-Max Scaling**: Rescales data to a fixed range, typically [0,1]
> - **Robust Scaling**: Uses statistics that are robust to outliers (median, IQR)
> 
> When to scale:
> 
> - Before applying distance-based algorithms (k-means, KNN)
> - For gradient-based optimization algorithms (neural networks)
> - When features have different units or ranges
> 
> Scaling should be applied after imputation to ensure the imputed values don't distort the scaling parameters.

> [!example] Data Scaling Implementation
> 
> Consider a dataset with features on different scales:
> 
> |Patient|Age|Income ($)|Blood Pressure|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|25|35,000|140|
> |B|62|85,000|125|
> |C|41|55,000|130|
> |D|33|48,000|135|
> 
> **Standardization (Z-score):**
> 
> 1. Calculate mean and standard deviation for each feature
>     - Age: mean = 40.25, std = 16.12
>     - Income: mean = 55,750, std = 21,435
>     - BP: mean = 132.5, std = 6.45
> 2. Apply formula: z = (x - mean) / std
> 
> Standardized data:
> 
> |Patient|Age|Income|Blood Pressure|
> |---|---|---|---|
> |A|-0.95|-0.97|1.16|
> |B|1.35|1.36|-1.16|
> |C|0.05|-0.04|-0.39|
> |D|-0.45|-0.36|0.39|
> 
> All features now have comparable scales, improving performance in algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.
