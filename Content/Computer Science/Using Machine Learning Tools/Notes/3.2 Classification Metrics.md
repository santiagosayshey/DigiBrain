> [!motivation] Why Measure Classification Performance
> 
> When developing classification models, we need objective ways to:
> 
> - Evaluate how accurately our model predicts class labels
> - Compare different classification algorithms and approaches
> - Tune model parameters for optimal performance
> - Understand trade-offs between different error types (false positives vs. false negatives)
> 
> Different classification metrics highlight different aspects of model performance, allowing us to select metrics aligned with the specific requirements of our application.

> [!idea] Confusion Matrix
> 
> A confusion matrix provides a tabular summary of classification results.
> 
> - Shows counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives
> - Basis for calculating many other metrics
> - Provides complete information about model's classification performance
> - Reveals which types of errors the model tends to make
> 
> **Structure**:
> 
> ||Predicted Positive|Predicted Negative|
> |---|---|---|
> |**Actual Positive**|True Positive (TP)|False Negative (FN)|
> |**Actual Negative**|False Positive (FP)|True Negative (TN)|

> [!idea] Accuracy
> 
> Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions among all predictions made.
> 
> - Most intuitive and commonly used classification metric
> - Works well when classes are balanced (similar number of instances)
> - Simple to explain to non-technical stakeholders
> - Can be misleading for imbalanced datasets
> 
> **Mathematical Definition**: $$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$
> 
> This formula:
> 
> 1. Counts true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) - correct predictions
> 2. Divides by the total number of predictions (including false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN))
> 3. Yields a value between 0 and 1, often expressed as a percentage

> [!idea] Precision and Recall
> 
> These metrics focus on different aspects of positive class prediction.
> 
> **Precision**
> 
> - Measures the accuracy of positive predictions. **What fraction of positive predictions are correct?**
> - Answers: "When the model predicts positive, how often is it correct?"
> - Critical when false positives are costly
> - Also called Positive Predictive Value
> 
> **Mathematical Definition**: $$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$
> 
> This formula divides true positives by all positive predictions, measuring how many positive predictions were actually correct.
> 
> **Recall**
> 
> - Measures the ability to find all positive instances. **What fraction of the real positive class are detected?**
> - Answers: "What proportion of actual positives did the model identify?"
> - Critical when missing positive cases is costly
> - Also called Sensitivity or True Positive Rate
> 
> **Mathematical Definition**: $$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$
> 
> This formula divides true positives by all actual positive cases, measuring how many positive cases were correctly identified.

> [!idea] F1 Score
> 
> F1 Score combines precision and recall into a single metric.
> 
> - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
> - Balances both metrics when a single evaluation metric is needed
> - Particularly useful for imbalanced datasets
> - Ranges from 0 (worst) to 1 (best)
> 
> **Mathematical Definition**: $$F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} = \frac{2TP}{2TP + FP + FN}$$
> 
> This formula:
> 
> 1. Multiplies precision and recall
> 2. Divides by their sum and multiplies by 2 (to scale from 0-1 instead of 0-0.5)
> 3. Ensures the model is penalized if either precision or recall is low


> [!consider] Classification Threshold and Precision-Recall Tradeoff
> 
> **Classification Threshold**
> 
> - Most classifiers don't directly output class labels (0/1); they output probability scores (0.0-1.0)
> - The threshold is the cutoff point above which we assign the positive class
> - Default threshold is typically 0.5, but can be adjusted based on needs
> - Example: For a spam classifier, if threshold = 0.7, emails with spam score > 0.7 are classified as spam
> 
> **Why Precision and Recall Trade Off**
> 
> - When we lower the threshold:
>     - More actual positives are correctly identified (↑ recall)
>     - But more negatives are incorrectly classified as positive (↓ precision)
>     - Example: Lower spam threshold catches more actual spam (higher recall) but also misclassifies more legitimate emails as spam (lower precision)
> - When we raise the threshold:
>     - Fewer negatives are incorrectly classified as positive (↑ precision)
>     - But more actual positives are missed (↓ recall)
>     - Example: Higher spam threshold ensures emails flagged as spam are nearly always spam (higher precision) but misses some actual spam (lower recall)
> 
> **When to Prioritize Recall**
> 
> - Medical diagnosis: Missing a disease (false negative) could be life-threatening
> - Fraud detection in banking: Missing fraudulent transactions could lead to significant financial losses
> - Predictive maintenance: Missing equipment failure signals could result in costly downtime
> 
> **When to Prioritize Precision**
> 
> - Content recommendation: Irrelevant recommendations (false positives) frustrate users
> - Criminal justice: Falsely identifying someone as guilty has severe consequences
> - Email spam filtering: Legitimate emails in spam folder (false positives) may never be seen
> 
> This inverse relationship means we rarely maximize both metrics simultaneously, requiring a strategic choice based on which error type is more costly in a given application.


[END OF IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS]

> [!idea] ROC Curve The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) across varying classification thresholds. It shows how a model balances correctly identifying positives versus incorrectly flagging negatives.
> 
> - **Use**: Evaluates discriminative ability without committing to a single threshold. Useful for comparing models under different operating conditions.
> - **Math**: TPR = $ \frac{TP}{TP + FN} $, FPR = $ \frac{FP}{FP + TN} $. Each threshold generates a point, and connecting them forms the curve. Observing this curve helps determine a model’s performance at every probability cutoff.

> [!idea] AUC AUC, or Area Under the Curve, summarizes the ROC curve into a single number between 0 and 1. It measures how effectively a model ranks positives above negatives overall.
> 
> - **Use**: Compares models on their ability to separate classes, independent of any specific threshold.
> - **Math**: $ \mathrm{AUC} = \int_{0}^{1} \text{TPR}(\text{FPR}) , d(\text{FPR}) $. Approximated by numerical integration (e.g., trapezoidal rule). A higher AUC indicates stronger separation between classes, aiding in model selection and comparison.

> [!example] Practical Use of ROC and AUC A loan approval model outputs probabilities of default for applicants. By varying the approval threshold from 0 to 1, we get a series of TPR-FPR pairs that form the ROC curve.
> 
> - **Interpretation**: A steep rise in TPR with minimal FPR increase indicates better discrimination. If the curve hugs the upper-left corner, the model has strong predictive power.
> - **AUC Insight**: An AUC of 0.90 suggests that 90% of the time, a randomly chosen positive (default) applicant is scored higher than a randomly chosen negative (non-default) applicant.
