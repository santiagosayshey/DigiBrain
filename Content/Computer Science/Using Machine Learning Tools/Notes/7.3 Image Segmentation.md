> [!idea] Image Segmentation using Clustering
>
> Image segmentation partitions an image into multiple segments, essentially grouping pixels. Clustering algorithms can achieve simpler forms of segmentation by grouping pixels with similar features (like color). Understanding the main goals helps clarify different approaches:
>
> Imagine an image containing **two dogs** and **three cats** playing on grass.
>
> * **Semantic Segmentation**: The goal here is to label pixels based on their object *category*.
>     * All pixels belonging to *any* dog would be assigned the label "dog" (e.g., colored red).
>     * All pixels belonging to *any* cat would be assigned the label "cat" (e.g., colored blue).
>     * All pixels belonging to the grass would be labeled "grass" (e.g., colored green).
>     * *Result:* You know where the dogs, cats, and grass are, but you can't distinguish dog #1 from dog #2 within the "dog" segment.
>
> * **Instance Segmentation**: This goes a step further and aims to identify each individual object *instance*.
>     * Pixels for dog #1 get a unique label, like "dog_1" (e.g., red).
>     * Pixels for dog #2 get a different unique label, like "dog_2" (e.g., orange).
>     * Pixels for cat #1 get "cat_1" (e.g., blue).
>     * Pixels for cat #2 get "cat_2" (e.g., light blue).
>     * Pixels for cat #3 get "cat_3" (e.g., cyan).
>     * Pixels for the grass get "grass" (e.g., green).
>     * *Result:* You can distinguish each individual animal, even those of the same category.
>
> While advanced techniques like neural networks are often used for these tasks, clustering provides a basis for simpler segmentation approaches, such as grouping by color.

> [!example] Color Segmentation with K-Means
>
> A specific application of clustering for segmentation is **color segmentation**, where pixels are grouped based on having similar colors. This can be useful for tasks like analyzing satellite images for areas with similar vegetation based on color. K-Means can perform this:
>
> 1.  **Load Image & Reshape for Clustering**:
>     * Load the image (e.g., using Pillow) into a NumPy array. This array initially has 3 dimensions: Height, Width, and Color Channels (e.g., R, G, B). For a 533x800 RGB image, the shape is `(533, 800, 3)`.
>     * K-Means expects input data as a 2D array where each *row* is a sample and *columns* are features. For color clustering, each *pixel* is a sample, and its R, G, B values are its *features*.
>     * Therefore, we need to reshape the original 3D image array `(height, width, 3)` into a 2D array where each row contains the 3 color values for one pixel. The total number of rows will be `height * width` (total pixels).
>     * The command `image.reshape(-1, 3)` does exactly this: it creates a new array with 3 columns (for R, G, B) and automatically calculates the number of rows (`-1`) needed to include all pixels.
>     ```python
>     import PIL
>     import numpy as np
>     from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
>
>     filepath = "ladybug.png" # Specify image path
>     image = np.asarray(PIL.Image.open(filepath))
>     # Original shape, e.g.: (533, 800, 3)
>
>     # Reshape into (total_pixels, num_channels) for K-Means
>     X = image.reshape(-1, 3)
>     # New shape, e.g.: (426400, 3)
>     ```
>     Now, `X` is a long list where each row represents a pixel's [R, G, B] color vector, ready for clustering.
>
> 2.  **Cluster Colors**: Apply K-Means to the 2D array (`X`) of pixel colors to group them into $k$ clusters. Each cluster center will represent a dominant color.
>     ```python
>     k = 8 # Choose the number of dominant colors
>     kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42).fit(X)
>     ```
>
> 3.  **Reconstruct Segmented Image**: Replace each pixel's original color vector with the color vector of its assigned cluster's centroid (`kmeans.cluster_centers_`). Use the `kmeans.labels_` array to know which centroid belongs to each pixel. Reshape this data back into the original image dimensions (Height x Width x Channels).
> 
> ```python
> # Assign each pixel the color of its cluster center
> segmented_colors = kmeans.cluster_centers_[kmeans.labels_]
> # Reshape back to original image dimensions
> segmented_img = segmented_colors.reshape(image.shape)
>
> # Optional: Cast to uint8 for display/saving
> # segmented_img_display = segmented_img.astype(np.uint8)
> ```
> This results in an image composed of only the $k$ dominant colors identified by K-Means.
