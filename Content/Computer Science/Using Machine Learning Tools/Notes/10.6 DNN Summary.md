> [!motivation] The Overfitting Challenge
>
> Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with their potentially millions of parameters, possess an incredible capacity to model complex data. However, this great flexibility also makes them particularly susceptible to **overfitting**.
> - Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing not only the underlying patterns but also the noise and specific quirks of that particular dataset.
> - Consequently, an overfit model performs poorly on new, unseen data, as it fails to generalize beyond the training examples.
> - To combat this and improve a model's ability to generalize, various **regularization** techniques are employed.
>
> While methods like **Early Stopping** and even **Batch Normalization** (which also offers a regularizing effect) are valuable tools against overfitting, this note will explore other dedicated regularization techniques commonly used in neural networks.
