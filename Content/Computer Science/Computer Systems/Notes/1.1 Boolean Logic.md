> [!idea] Boolean Logic Fundamentals
> - All digital devices utilize chips to store and process binary information, all fundamentally built upon consistent elementary logic gates, irrespective of the diverse hardware implementations.

> [!idea] Boolean Algebra
> - Boolean algebra handles two-state binary values, labelled as 1 and 0
> - A Boolean function operates on these binary inputs and returns binary outputs
> - The most basic of these functions are **AND, OR and NOT**
> - These basic functions can be combined to make more complicated ones - **NAND, NOR and XOR**
> - Furthermore, it can be said that any of the three basic functions can be expressed using only **NAND** gates ( or **NOR** )
> - This means that ***EVERY*** Boolean function can be expressed solely in terms of **NAND** gates

> [!idea] Basic Boolean Operations
> ### AND
> - This operator gives the result true if both operands are true
> - Expressed as: $$ A \cdot B $$
> 
> ### OR
> - This operator gives the result true if EITHER operands are true
> - Expressed as: $$ A + B $$
> 
> ### NOT
> - This operator gives the result true if the operand is false
> - Expressed as: $$ \overline{A} $$

> [!idea] Compound Boolean Operations
> ### NAND
> - This operator returns true if at least one of the operands is false
> - Expressed as:$$ \overline{A \cdot B} $$
> 
> ### NOR
> - This operator returns true only of both operands are false
> - Expressed as: $$ \overline{A + B} $$
> 
> ### XOR
> - This operator returns true if only 1 operand is true and the other is false
> - Expressed as: $$ (A \cdot \overline{B}) + (\overline{A} \cdot B) $$

> [!example] Sum of Product
> 1. Find lines with out = 1
> 2. Write inputs as a product of each other
>    1. If the input is 0, write a bar above it
> 3. Repeat step 2 for each remaining line with out = 1
> 4. Sum each of these products together

> [!example] Product of Sum

> 2. Write inputs as sum of each other
>    1. if input = 1, write with bar above
> 3. Repeat step 2 for every line with out = 0
> 4. Take product of each of the sums
