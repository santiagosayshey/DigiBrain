> *When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.* - R. Buckminster Fuller (1895–1993)
## Code Generation
- The goal is to convert high level language understood by humans, into low level code understood by computers

### Compiling Variables
- All primitive types are 16 bit, so each variable is 1 *word* long
- Static variables should exist only once during the entirety of the program's life
- Field variables should exist for each object and only during that object's life cycle
- Subroutine variables should exist for each time the routine is called and then freed after it ends
	- All of these are handled with the VM memory segments - `static, local, argument, this, that`
- Managed using a symbol table

#### Symbol Table
- When the compiler encounters a variable in a high level statement, it needs to know what memory segment it should belong to and what it represents

```
let y = foo(x)

- static, field, local?
- int, boolean, char, object?
```

- These properties can easily be managed using a **symbol table**
- When a variable is declared in the source code, the compiler allocates the needed VM memory segment and records this mapping in the symbol table
	- Whenever a variable is encountered, it's properties are retrieved from this table or if it doesn't exist yet, is added to it
- These variables can exist in multiple scopes and in which they can possess different properties
	- Static and field variables are scoped to the class in which they are declared
	- Local and arg variables are scoped to the subroutine in which they are declared
	- This is achieved using a symbol table for each scope

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231010055227.png)

- Scopes are nested, with inner scopes hiding outer ones
	- Variables are searched outwards and if not found, are added to the symbol table in the current scope
- Jack only has two scopes, the subroutine level and the class level, and therefore, only two symbol tables

#### Variable Declarations
1. **Compiler Start for Class Declaration**:
   - Create class-level symbol table.
   - Create subroutine-level symbol table.

1. **On Parsing `static` or `field` Variable**:
   - Add to class-level table.
   - Record: variable name, type, kind (`static` or `field`), and index within kind.
   
3. **On Starting Subroutine Compilation**:
   - Reset subroutine-level table.
   - If subroutine is a method:
	 - Add row `<this, className, arg, 0>` to subroutine-level table.

1. **On Parsing `local` or `argument` Variable**:
   - Add to subroutine-level table.
   - Record: variable name, type, kind (`var` or `arg`), and index within kind.
   
5. **Indexing**:
   - Start index for each kind (`var` or `arg`) at 0.
   - Increment by 1 for each new variable of that kind added.

#### Variables in Statements
1. **Variable in a Statement**:
   - Compiler first checks subroutine-level symbol table for the variable.
   - If not found, checks class-level symbol table.
   
2. **Variable Found**:
   - Compiler completes translation of the statement.

### Compiling Expressions
- Goal is to convert infix notation (high level) to postfix notation (VM commands)

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231010061407.png)

- Achieved using a simple algorithm that parses an expression from left to right
	- Can call itself recursively to handle larger simple expressions

### Compiling Strings
- **Jack’s String Handling**:
	- When a string constant appears in code:
		- Compiler generates code to call `String` constructor (creates new `String` object).
		- Initializes object with characters using `appendChar` for each character.
	- Can be inefficient and lead to memory leaks.

- **Example**:
	- Statement: `Output.printString("Loading … please wait")`.
	- Creates a persistent `String` object in memory, even if just displaying a message.
   
-  **Comparison with Modern Languages**:
	- Java, C#, and Python have garbage collection to reclaim memory from unused objects.
	- Modern languages employ optimizations and specialized string classes for efficiency.

### Compiling Statements
- **Jack Statements**:
   - Includes: `let`, `do`, `return`, `if`, `while`.

#### **Compiling `return` Statements**:
   - Call `compileExpression` to evaluate and push expression value to the stack.
   - Generate VM command `return`.

#### **Compiling `let` Statements**:
   - Handle form: `let varName = expression`.
   - Process:
     - Remember `varName`.
     - Call `compileExpression` to push expression value to stack.
     - Generate VM command like `pop varName` (mapped from symbol table, e.g., `local 3`, `static 1`).
   - Array handling of `let` statements discussed later in the chapter.

#### **Compiling `do` Statements**:
   - Handle form: `do className.functionName(exp1, exp2, … , expn)`.
   - Purpose: Call subroutine for effect, disregard return value.
   - Recommendation:
     - Compile as if the syntax is `do expression`.
     - Call `compileExpression`.
     - Remove topmost stack element using command like `pop temp 0`.
   - Compilation for other `do` statement forms discussed later (e.g., `do varName.methodName(...)`, `do methodName(...)`).

#### **Compiling `if` and `while` Statements**:
   - High-level languages have various control flow statements (like `if`, `while`, `for`, `switch`).
   - Low-level languages (assembly, VM) use primitives like conditional `goto` and unconditional `goto`.
   - Challenge: Map high-level control flow to `goto` primitives.
   
- **Compiler Logic for `if` Statements**:
   - Upon detecting `if` keyword, the compiler expects: `if (expression) {statements} else {statements}`.
   - Start with `compileExpression` to compute and push expression's value.
   - Use VM command `not` to negate the expression's value.
   - Generate a label (e.g., `L1`) and follow with VM command `if-goto L1`.
   - Call `compileStatements` to process the sequence of statements (e.g., `let`, `do`, `return`, `if`, `while`).
   
- **Handling Multiple Control Flows**:
   - Programs have multiple `if` and `while` instances.
   - Compiler generates globally unique labels, using a running counter for distinction.
   
- **Nested Control Flows**:
   - Control statements can be nested (e.g., `if` inside `while` inside another `while`).
   - Handled by the recursive nature of `compileStatements`.

### Compiling Objects

- **Object Handling in Object-Oriented Languages**:
	- Aggregate abstractions named objects.
	- Each object: a memory block referenced by static, field, local, or argument variables.
	- Reference variable (also object variable or pointer) contains the memory block’s base address.

- **Method Calls on Objects**:
	- Many objects might exist on the heap.
	- Method call format: `p.foo()` to call method `foo` on object `p`.
	- Inside method, current object referred to as `this`.
	- Method's VM commands referencing `this` (e.g., `this 0`, `this 1`) should affect the called object’s fields.

- **VM Mechanism for Object-Method Alignment**:
	- Virtual machine uses two-valued pointer segment (THIS and THAT) for this alignment.
	- Pointer THIS (pointer 0) holds the base address for the memory segment `this`.
	- Align `this` segment with object `p` by pushing p’s address to the stack and popping it into pointer 0.

#### Compiling Constructor Calls
- **Introduction to Object Construction in OOP**:
  - Objects created by constructors.
  - Constructors handle both variable declaration (e.g., `var Point p`) and object instantiation (e.g., `let p = Point.new(2,3)`).
  - Even if done in one statement, the action divides into declaration and construction.

- **Deep Dive into Object Construction**:
  - `let p = Point.new(2,3)` implies:
	- Allocation of two-word memory block for a new Point instance.
	- Initialization of block words to 2 and 3.
	- `p` references base address of the block.
  - Assumptions:
	- Constructor knows memory block size.
	- Constructor returns the base address of the memory block upon completion.

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231010064415.png)

  - Caller declares two object variables.
  - Calls a class constructor to construct the objects.
  - Constructor allocates memory blocks for objects.
  - Calling code makes object variables reference these memory blocks.

- **Three Key Observations from Figure 11.7**:
	- Compilation of `let p = Point.new(2,3)` and `let p = Point.new(5,7)` is standard. What's unique is the implicit object construction.
	- Physical addresses (6012 and 9543) don't matter to high-level or VM code. Symbolic references (`p1`, `p2`, `local 0`, `local 1`) are used, which makes programs relocatable and safer.
	- During compile-time: symbol table updates and low-level code generates. Object construction and variable binding occur at run-time when the compiled code executes.

#### Compiling Constructors
- **Overview of Constructor Compilation**:
	- Constructors seen as black box abstractions so far.
	- But a constructor is essentially a subroutine, with special tasks:
		- Creates a new object.
		- Makes that new object the current object (`this`).

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231010065106.png)

- **Creating a New Object**:
	- Find free RAM block of sufficient size.
	- Mark that block as used.
	- Tasks outsourced to the host OS.
	- OS API `Memory.alloc(size)` returns a block’s base address.
	- Constructor’s task: Use `alloc` to get memory, `deAlloc` for release.

- **Determining Size for Memory Allocation**:
	- Computed from class-level symbol table.
	- Example: `Point` class, with `x` and `y`, needs size 2.
	- Compiler thus pushes `constant 2`, then calls `Memory.alloc 1` for the `Memory.alloc(2)` function call.
	- Once memory is allocated, its base address is set as `THIS` for the constructor.

- **After Memory Alignment**:
	- Code generation becomes straightforward.
	- `let` statement example: `x` maps to `this 0` and `ax` to `argument 0`.
	- The alignment ensures `push/pop this i` commands interact with correct RAM locations.

- **Ending a Constructor**:
	- Jack specification dictates ending with `return this`.
	- Pushes `THIS`, the base address of the object, onto the stack.
	- In other languages (e.g., Java), while constructors might not explicitly end with `return this`, their compiled version performs the same VM-level action.
	- On constructor termination, the variable from the caller side holds the base address of the newly constructed object.

#### Compiling Method Calls
- **Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Methods**:
	- Procedural (e.g., C-style): Function call syntax like `distance(p1,p2)`.
	- Object-Oriented: Method call syntax like `p1.distance(p2)`.
		- Methods always operate on a specific object.

- **Object-Oriented Abstractions**:
	- Objects are assumed to encapsulate their operations. For instance:
		- A `Point` object can compute its distance to another `Point`.
	- Compilers actualize these high-level abstractions.
	- Target VM language doesn't inherently understand objects or methods.
	- The compiler translates object-oriented method calls to a procedural style.
		- Example: `p1.distance(p2)` becomes `push p1, push p2, call distance`.

- **Jack's Method Calls**:
	- Jack supports two kinds of method calls.
	- Method calls with a variable name:
	- Syntax: `varName.methodName(exp1, exp2, …, expn)`.
	- Compile by:
		- Push the variable name (after symbol table mapping).
		- If no variable name is mentioned, push the mapping of `this`.
		- Call `compileExpressionList` which in turn calls `compileExpression` for each expression in the parentheses.
		- Lastly, generate `call className.methodName` with the number of arguments.
	- Argument-less method call special case:
	- Translated into `call className.methodName 1`.
	- The `className` is derived from the symbol table type of the `varName`.

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231010073511.png)

#### Compiling Methods
- Methods, like `distance`, are seen from the caller's perspective.
- In Java and Jack, methods operate on the "current object" using the `this` identifier.
- It's possible to write methods without explicitly using `this`.
- In Jack, direct object.field operations aren't supported.
	- Fields are accessed via accessor and mutator methods.
	- Example: Instead of `x - other.x`, Jack uses `x - other.getx()`.
- Jack's compiler identifies fields using symbol tables.
	- The current object's representation is the first passed argument.
	- In context, the object whose method is being called has its base address as argument 0.
- This abstraction allows methods to be applied to objects in languages like Java, Python, and Jack.
- During compilation:
	1. A method call looks like `p1.distance(p2)`.
	2. The callee's compiled code starts by pointing to the object with `push argument 0`, then `pop pointer 0`.
	3. This sets the method's `THIS` pointer to the called object's base address.
	4. The `this` segment in the method aligns with the called object's base address.
	5. Commands like `push this 0` align correctly with the object's fields.
	6. Expressions translate accordingly, e.g., `x - other.getx()` becomes `push this 0, push argument 1, call Point.getx 1, sub`.
	7. The `THIS` alignment guarantees accurate targeting of the object's fields.

### Compiling Arrays
- **Arrays in Jack**:
	- Arrays in Jack are treated as objects.
	- Implemented as instances of the Array class in the OS.
	- Arrays differ from objects due to index-based element access.
  
- **Compiler Role**:
	- Translates array abstractions to concrete code.
	- `arr[i]` can be represented as a memory address.
	- Compiler's job: Translate high-level array operations to low-level commands.

- **Compilation Strategy**:
	- To get the physical address of `arr[i]`: `push arr`, `push i`, `add`.
	- Store the result using `pop pointer 1`.
	- Allows operations like `push that 0` and `pop x`.

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231010080124.png)
  
- **Flaw in the Strategy**:
	- Works for expressions like `let x = arr[i]`.
	- Fails for indexed assignments, e.g., `let arr[i] = x`.
	- Issue: The value in pointer 1 is overridden, losing `a[i]`'s address.
  
- **Solution**:
	- Generate commands: `push arr`, `compileExpression`, `add`.
	- Store the address `(arr + expression1)` on the stack.
	- Save the resulting value (e.g., using `pop temp 0`).
	- This allows operations like `pop pointer 1`, `push temp 0`, `pop that 0`.
	- The strategy can handle recursive complexity

## Implementation

### Standard Mapping

#### **Naming Conventions**:
- Jack file `Xxx.jack` becomes VM file `Xxx.vm`.
- Subroutine `yyy` in `Xxx.jack` is compiled into VM function `Xxx.yyy`.
#### **Mapping Variables**:
  - Static variables in class: `static 0`, `static 1`, `static 2`, ...
  - Field variables in class: `this 0`, `this 1`, `this 2`, ...
  - Local variables in subroutine: `local 0`, `local 1`, `local 2`, ...
  - Arguments in function/constructor: `argument 0`, `argument 1`, ...
  - Arguments in method: `argument 1`, `argument 2`, `argument 3`, ... (since `arg 0` is the base address of the caller)
#### **Mapping Object Fields**:
- Use `push argument 0, pop pointer 0` to align virtual segment `this` with the passed object.
#### **Mapping Array Elements**:
- Reference `arr[expression]` is compiled by setting `pointer 1` to `(arr + expression)` and accessing `that 0`.
#### **Mapping Constants**:
- Jack's `null` and `false`: `push constant 0`.
- Jack's `true`: `push constant 1, neg` (pushes value -1 to the stack).
- Jack's `this`: `push pointer 0` (pushes the base address of the current object).

### Implementation Guidelines

#### **Handling Identifiers**:
- Use symbol tables for naming variables.
- Any identifier not in the symbol tables is likely a subroutine or a class name.
#### Compiling Expressions:
- The `compileExpression` routine processes input in the sequence: `term op term op term ...`.
- Use the `codeWrite` algorithm, enhanced to handle all terms from the Jack grammar.
- Most compilation action happens during the compilation of underlying terms.
- Subroutine calls should be managed by the compilation of terms.
- The expression grammar and its corresponding routine are recursive.
	- If a left parenthesis is detected, `compileExpression` should recursively call itself for the inner expression.
- Jack supports no operator priority, except the priority rule. 
- e.g., For parentheses, evaluate the inner expression first.
- Handling operator priority is an optional compiler-specific extension, not a standard Jack feature.

- **Compilation Examples**:
	- Expression `x * y`: Compile to `push x, push y, call Math.multiply 2`.
	- Expression `x / y`: Compile to `push x, push y, call Math.divide 2`.

#### **Compiling Strings**:
  - String constant "ccc … c" is managed by:
	i. Pushing string length on stack and calling the `String.new` constructor.
	ii. Pushing character code of c on stack and invoking `String.appendChar` for each character.
	- The `new` constructor and `appendChar` method push the string object back onto the stack.

#### **Compiling Function Calls and Constructor Calls**:
- For functions/constructors with n arguments:
	i. Call `compileExpressionList` (which will call `compileExpression` n times).
	ii. Make the call, indicating n arguments were pushed.

#### **Compiling Method Calls**:
  - For methods with n arguments:
	i. Push a reference to the object the method operates on.
	ii. Call `compileExpressionList` (calling `compileExpression` n times).
	iii. Make the call, noting arguments were pushed.

#### **Compiling do Statements**:
- Treat `do subroutineCall` as `do expression` and remove the top stack value using `pop temp 0`.

#### **Compiling Classes**:
- On class compile start, initialize class-level symbol table with field and static variables. Also, create an empty subroutine-level symbol table.

#### **Compiling Subroutines**:
- Initialize the subroutine’s symbol table.
- If a method, map <this, className, arg, 0> in the table.
- Add parameters and local variables to the table.
- Start generating code with the `function className.subroutineName nVars` command.
- If it's a method, generate code to align the 'this' segment with the object base address.

#### **Compiling Constructors**:
- Perform actions as in subroutine compilation.
- Generate code for memory allocation and alignment.
- The constructor ends by returning the new object's base address.

#### **Compiling Void Methods and Void Functions**:
- VM functions should push a value onto the stack before returning.
- Void methods/functions end with `push constant 0, return`.

#### **Compiling Arrays**:
- Statements like `let arr[expression1] = expression2` are compiled as described earlier
- There's no need to use 'that' entries with an index greater than 0 when dealing with arrays.

### Software Architecture
- `JackCompiler`: main program, sets up and invokes the other modules 
- `JackTokenizer`: tokenizer for the Jack language 
- `SymbolTable`: keeps track of all the variables found in the Jack code 
- `VMWriter`: writes VM code 
- `CompilationEngine`: recursive top-down compilation engine

##### Examples

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231016182618.png)
- Be sure to add this as `arg 0` for methods, this is also why the actual arguments are offset 1 more than if they were in a function

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231016184223.png)

- Its the second option.

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231016184605.png)
- Arg 0 always refers to the object itself when calling a method, this allows you to access local field variables through the this keyword

![](docs/Images/Pasted%20image%2020231016184656.png)

- For the constructor, we call the mem alloc function with the size of the class (1 in this case because we have 1 field variable)
- Then we push the initial variables in that object, push the pointer to the object back on the stack and return it

- Wrong class name
- Need to say whether static or field
- Need to add function or method before declaration
