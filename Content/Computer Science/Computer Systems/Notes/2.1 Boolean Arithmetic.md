## Arithmetic Operations
- Computers must be able to perform:
	- Addition
	- Sign Conversion
	- Subtraction
	- Comparison
	- Multiplication
	- Division


## Binary Numbers
- Using the decimal system, we can say that a number is just the sum of each digit in base 10, ie, each digit is multiplied by 10 to the index of the digit (starting from 0 on the right)
	- For example, 6083 can be expressed as: $$ 6083 = 6 \cdot 10^3 + 0 \cdot 10^2 + 8 \cdot 10^1 + 3 \cdot 10^0
$$

- The same numbers can be broken down for each base, base two for the case of binary numbers
	- For example, the number 19, expressed in binary is: $$
10011_2 = 1 \cdot 2^4 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 19_{10}

$$


### Fixed Word Size
- Computers are finite machines that have a fixed size for representing numbers
	- Expressed in bits - 8, 16, 32, 64, etc
	- For example, an 8 bit register can code 2^8 = 256 different things
	- Therefore, an n-bit binary system can code 2^n different things


## Binary Addition
- When adding binary numbers, we start from the rightmost bit (least significant bit) and move towards the left
- If the sum of two bits is 2 (10 in binary), we write down the 0 and carry the 1 over to the next more significant bit
- If the sum is 3 (11 in binary), we write down the 1 and carry the 1 over to the next more significant bit
- If there is a carry out of the leftmost bit, it's an overflow.

- Consider the binary numbers 1011011 and 1110011. Here's how we add them: $$
\begin{array}{r}
\text{ }\phantom{+} \overbrace{\mathbf{1}}^{\text{Overflow}} \\
\text{ }\phantom{+} 1011011 \\
+ \text{ } 1110011 \\
\hline
\text{ } 1100110 \\
\end{array}
$$
- From right to left:
1. 1 + 1 = 0 with a carry of 1 (10 in binary).
2. 1 (from carry) + 1 + 1 = 1 with a carry of 1 (11 in binary).
3. 1 (from carry) + 0 + 0 = 1 with no carry.
4. 1 + 1 = 0 with a carry of 1.
5. 1 (from carry) + 1 + 1 = 1 with a carry of 1.
6. 1 (from carry) + 0 + 1 = 0 with a carry of 1.
7. 1 (from carry) + 1 + 1 = 1 with a carry of 1.

- The carry out of the leftmost bit (bolded) is an overflow and is generally discarded in fixed-size binary arithmetic.


## Signed Binary Numbers (Positive and Negative Numbers)
- Signed numbers essentially take the size of a regular register, and halves it (allowing the negative compliment to exist as well)
- To check whether or not a value is positive or negative, we look at the most significant (left most bit)
	- If 0, then positive
	- If 1, then negative 
- To express a number in binary as it’s negative, we flip each bit (1s become 0s and vice versa), then add one, starting from the right most bit (add 1 binary, not decimal)
- This method is called *Two’s Compliment*
- This poses an issue with overflow errors, as when it happens, a positive number is then expressed as a negative one
- This means that we can just treat subtraction as a special case of addition 
	- Consider 5-7
	- This is the same as 5 + (-7)
	- If we add their resulting binary numbers( 0101 + 1001 ), we get 1110, which is indeed the binary code of -2

## Adders
- Add bits together
	- Half adder adds two bits
	- Full adder adds three bits
	- *Adder* adds two *n* bit numbers
	- Incremented adds 1 to a given number 

###  Half Adder
- A half adder is a digital circuit that performs the addition of two binary digits.
- It has two inputs (for the two bits being added) and two outputs (for the sum and carry).
- The sum output represents the XOR of the two inputs.
- The carry output represents the AND of the two inputs.

### Full Adder
- A full adder is an extension of the half adder, designed to handle the addition of three bits -- the two bits being added, plus an incoming carry from the addition of the previous pair of bits.
- It has three inputs (two bits for addition and one carry input) and two outputs (the sum and the carry).
- The sum output represents the XOR of the three inputs.
- The carry output is true if any two or all three of the inputs are true.

### Adder
- To add n-bit numbers, we use a series of n full adders, each handling the addition of one pair of corresponding bits and the carry from the previous pair.
- This setup is often called a ripple-carry adder because the carry 'ripples' from one bit to the next.
- The carry-out from each full adder is the carry-in for the next.
- An overflow occurs if there's a final carry-out from the last full adder, because there's no (n+1)th bit position to hold it in the n-bit result.

### Incrementor
- Adds 1 to a given number
- This allows fetching the next instruction from memory

## Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Computes a set of arithmetic and logic operations
- Consists of two input integers and size 1bit control bits, which tell the ALU what operation to perform on the input integers
- These control bits can be manipulated to allow for even more operations than initially realised
- This is an example ALU that operates on two 16 bit integers

##### Example - x-1

- **The Goal:** We want to compute the function `x - 1` for `x = 27`. In other words, we want to subtract 1 from the number 27.
- **Setting Up the Inputs:** To do this, we first feed the 16-bit binary code of 27 into the `x` input of the ALU. Since we are subtracting 1 from `x`, the `y` input doesn't matter in this case.
- **Setting the Control Bits:** We set the ALU's control bits to `001110`. Let's break down what each bit does:
    - `zx = 0`: Leaves `x` as it is.
    - `nx = 0`: Does not negate `x`.
    - `zy = 1`: Sets `y` to 0.
    - `ny = 1`: Negates `y` to become -1 (since negating 0 in two's complement gives -1).
    - `f = 1`: Chooses the addition operation for `out = x + y` (which in this case is `x + (-1) = x - 1`).
    - `no = 0`: Leaves the output as is.
- **The Operation:** These settings essentially tell the ALU to leave `x` unchanged, negate `y` to -1, add `x` and `-1`, and leave the result as is.
- **The Output:** Given these control bit settings, the ALU should output the binary code representing 26, which is `x - 1`.
