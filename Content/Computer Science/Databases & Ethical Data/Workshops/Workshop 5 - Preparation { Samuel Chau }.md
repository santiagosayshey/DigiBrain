## Question 1

```
Explain what the Gettier problem is and give an example.
```

Situations where beliefs seem to be true and justified, but only by accident.
### Example - A Cow

- I observe a shape on the hill
- I believe it to be a cow because it is cow shaped and dark
- The shape is a cow - WRONG
	- The hill is covered in cow shaped, dark objects that are not cows but rocks
	- The shape `I happened to look at` is a cow
	- This is the Gettier Problem - while the belief is true and justified, it is only true by accident

## Question 2

```
What is empiricism? Given an example of empirical knowledge.
```

Empiricism is a school of thought that relies on evidence acquired through direct and indirect observation, experimentation, and experience.

Example: Boiling Point of Water

When heating a pot of water, we observe that the water begins to boil and produce steam. Using a thermometer, we measure the temperature at which the water starts boiling. Through observations and measurements, we find that water boils at about 100°C.

## Question 3 

```
Descartes famously said "Cogito, ergo sum", which means "I think, therefore I am." (He actually said it in French, but it's always quoted in Latin.) Explain how this can be used to provide a foundation for knowledge.
```

> *Je pense, donc je suis*

Descartes used radical doubt to question everything, including the reliability of his senses and the existence of the external world. In the process, he realized that the very act of doubting proved his existence as a thinking being. This self-awareness became his foundational point of certainty, upon which he aimed to build a secure system of knowledge. In essence, even if everything else could be doubted, the existence of oneself as a thinker is undeniable.

## Question 4 

```
What is a Zero-knowledge proof? Give an example.
```

A Zero Knowledge Proof is the process of proving one possesses knowledge without revealing the actual knowledge.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Magic Cave Example

- **Participants**:
  - **Peggy**: Prover, knows the magic word.
  - **Victor**: Verifier, wants proof but should not learn the magic word.
#### Cave Structure
- The cave has a **single entrance** and splits into two paths, re-joining at the other end.
- A **magic door** in the middle can only be opened with a special word.

#### Simplified Steps
1. **Peggy Enters the Cave**:
   - Peggy chooses either the left or right path.
   - Victor stays outside and cannot see which path she chooses.

2. **Victor’s Request**:
   - Victor shouts for Peggy to exit from either the left or the right path randomly.

3. **Peggy Exits the Cave**:
   - Peggy exits from the requested side, using the magic word if necessary.
   - Victor sees Peggy exit but doesn't know whether she used the magic word or retraced her steps.

4. **Repetition**:
   - The process is repeated multiple times.
   - Victor's confidence increases with every correct exit but he learns nothing about the magic word.

### Summary
- Peggy proves she knows the magic word without revealing it.
- Victor doesn't learn the magic word, regardless of repetition.
- This illustrates a Zero-Knowledge Proof, providing proof of knowledge without revealing any information about the knowledge itself.
## Question 5

```
Can you think of a situation, from movies, books, or your own life, when it would have been good to be able to confirm that somebody knew something without you having to reveal what you knew?
```

In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1", Remus use a specific question about the recent past to verify Harry's identity (e.g., "What creature sat in the corner the last time Harry Potter visited my office?"). If Harry answers correctly, they confirm they are who they say they are, since a disguised intruder would not know that piece of information. This method was used to ensure the person hadn't been impersonated, without revealing the full range of what the asker knew.
