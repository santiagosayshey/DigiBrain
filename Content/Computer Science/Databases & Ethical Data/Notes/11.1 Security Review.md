## Protecting Databases
- Databases need to be protected from:
	- Unauthorised access
	- Malicious destruction or alteration
	- Inconsistency

## Inconsistency
- Keeping the data inside a database system consistent can be a huge challenge. Issues include:
	- Crash recovery
	- Concurrency control - having multiple people reading and writing concurrently can cause issues
	- Distributed systems
- In reality, it's incredibly difficult the ensure the safety and consistency of databases

## Accidents
- Accidents can lead to:
	- Crashes
	- Unsynchronised updates
	- Incorrect changes and deletions
	- Incorrect code

## Malice
- More aligned with unauthorised access to data:
	- Reading
	- Modification
	- Destruction

## Leaks, Attacks & Mistakes
- Lead to two things:
	- Loss of data
	- Loss of access to data


## Security Measures
- Physical
- Human
- Operating System
- Data System


##### Examples

```
Why is crash recovery so important?
```

In the case that we do lead to data loss or loss of access to said data, the ability to recover to a previous state of being is incredibly important. Having regular backups will vastly help in minimising any potential data loss. It ensures that our system will continue to work for as long as we need it and satisfy the requirements of out clients

```
Describe a scenario where concurrent access to data could lead to inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the database
```

Dirty reads. One person reads a piece of data just before someone writes to it.
