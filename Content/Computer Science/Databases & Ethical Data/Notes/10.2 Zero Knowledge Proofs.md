- A method by which one person can prove to another that something is true, without conveying any information except that statement is true
- Must satisfy:
	- Completeness - It it’s true, an honest power will convince an honest verifier
	- Soundness - If it’s false, there is a very low probability of convincing people
	- Zero Knowledge - If it’s true, the verifier learns nothing more than the fact that’s true

## Prove You Know Something
- Telling someone what you know is one way
- Giving secondary information is another, but it still leaks information
- How can you keep something secret and still prove that someone else knows it?

## Participants
- Prover
- Verifier

### Interactive Protocol
- The prover needs to convince the verifier that they have the knowledge
- The verifier needs to interact with the prover, and the prover responds to this interaction
- Because of this interaction, the verifier can’t just save the responses and use it to convince someone else
- A zero knowledge proof does not lead to other people gaining the knowledge

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Magic Cave Allegory

- **Concept**: Proving one possesses knowledge without revealing the actual knowledge.
- **Participants**:
  - **Peggy**: Prover, knows the magic word.
  - **Victor**: Verifier, wants proof but should not learn the magic word.
#### Cave Structure
- The cave has a **single entrance** and splits into two paths, rejoining at the other end.
- A **magic door** in the middle can only be opened with a special word.

#### Simplified Steps
1. **Peggy Enters the Cave**:
   - Peggy chooses either the left or right path.
   - Victor stays outside and cannot see which path she chooses.

2. **Victor’s Request**:
   - Victor shouts for Peggy to exit from either the left or the right path randomly.

3. **Peggy Exits the Cave**:
   - Peggy exits from the requested side, using the magic word if necessary.
   - Victor sees Peggy exit but doesn't know whether she used the magic word or retraced her steps.

4. **Repetition**:
   - The process is repeated multiple times.
   - Victor's confidence increases with every correct exit but he learns nothing about the magic word.

### Summary
- Peggy proves she knows the magic word without revealing it.
- Victor doesn't learn the magic word, regardless of repetition.
- This illustrates a Zero-Knowledge Proof, providing proof of knowledge without revealing any information about the knowledge itself.

##### Examples

1.
```
Imagine your friend is red/green colour blind (while you are not) and you have two balls - one red and one green, but otherwise identical. To your friend they seem completely identical, he doesn’t believe they can be told apart

You want to prove to him they are in fact different colours, but nothing else. In particular you don’t want to reveal which is red / green.

How could you do this? Why is this zero knowledge?
```

- Here is the proof system. You give the two balls to Victor and he puts them behind his back. Next, he takes one of the balls and brings it out from behind his back and displays it. He then places it behind his back again and then chooses to reveal just one of the two balls, picking one of the two at random with equal probability. He will ask you, "Did I switch the ball?" This whole procedure is then repeated as often as necessary. 
- By looking at the balls' colours, you can, of course, say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if the balls were the same colour and hence indistinguishable, there is no way you could guess correctly with probability higher than 50%. 
- Since the probability that you would have randomly succeeded at identifying each switch/non-switch is 50%, the probability of having randomly succeeded at all switch/non-switches approaches zero ("soundness"). If you and your friend repeat this "proof" multiple times (e.g. 20 times), your friend should become convinced ("completeness") that the balls are indeed differently coloured.
