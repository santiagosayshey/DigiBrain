## What is a Relational Database?
- A database that is built on mathematical relations
- Looks like a table of values
- A relation is a table of values where each row represents a collection of data values
	- These rows are called tuples (where each column in the table has a name (attribute) and a domain of values)

##### Example - Student Relational Database

| Name         | Date of Birth | Phone         | Enrolment Date | Prefix |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| John Smith   | 1999-05-15    | 123-456-7890  | 2023-07-01     | Mr     |
| Jane Doe     | 2000-11-30    | 987-654-3210  | 2023-07-05     | Ms     |
| Alex Johnson | 2002-03-20    | 555-555-5555  | 2023-06-15     | Mr     |
| Sarah Lee    | 2001-09-10    | 111-222-3333  | 2023-07-10     | Miss   |

- The domain of each attribute is the set of possible values it can take - like a data type (string, int, etc)

### Constraints
1. Each tuple must be unique
2. The attribute's domain applies to all entries under that attribute. The only other possible value is NULL (which mean it doesn't exist)
3. This appears ordered but tuples are still equivalent even if another order
4. This is an abstract representation and does not impose formal structure


### Keys
- We need to create a key attribute that can uniquely identify a tuple (i.e., its not repeated in any other tuple)
- We can do this by adding a separate ID attribute for each tuple
- These keys CANNOT be null

| ID | Name         | Date of Birth | Phone         | Enrolment Date | Prefix |
|----|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| 1  | John Smith   | 1999-05-15    | 123-456-7890  | 2023-07-01     | Mr     |
| 2  | Jane Doe     | 2000-11-30    | 987-654-3210  | 2023-07-05     | Ms     |
| 3  | Alex Johnson | 2002-03-20    | 555-555-5555  | 2023-06-15     | Mr     |
| 4  | Sarah Lee    | 2001-09-10    | 111-222-3333  | 2023-07-10     | Miss   |

### Other Relations
- We can link two relations together through foreign keys
- To keep referential integrity, we should only link foreign keys that exist in other tables

##### Example - Students and Degrees
- We can see that degree is a foreign key that is used as a unique primary key for another table

| ID | Name         | Date of Birth | Phone         | Enrolment Date | Prefix | Degree     |
|----|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------|------------|
