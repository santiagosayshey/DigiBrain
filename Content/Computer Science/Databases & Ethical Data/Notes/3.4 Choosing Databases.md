## Relational Databases
### Benefits
- There are several things that relational databases do well:

1. Categorising Data: The tabular nature means that data drawn from a given column must reflect the domain of the attribute
2. Accurate: Data is stored once
3. Easy to Use: SQL runs over the top and depends upon the integrity and type guarantees of the tables
4. Security: Table access can be limited to certain users

### Drawbacks
1. Structured: A great deal of planning is required to build the table as it's really rigid once built
2. Maintenance: The databases need to be supported and structural change (evolution) can be demanding
3. Inflexibility: Very bad at large amounts of unstructured data. Qualitative data or anything that requires schema evolution is difficult to manage
4. Scalability: Do not scale well (horizontally) across multiple servers and performance impacts can be due to the overheads


## NoSQL
### Benefits
1. Unstructured Data: Far less rigidity in definition and storage of information
2. Easily scalable: Can scale up horizontally and vertically, which means speed and availability!
3. Easier to manage: Less table maintenance and may require less tuning
4. Cheaper: SQL systems are generally more expensive in terms of hardware and software


### Drawbacks
1. CAP Theorem: Eventual Consistency is often the model used
2. Programming: There are fewer enforced constraints in the DB itself, so more programming effort is required to use the API correctly
3. Less Mature: NoSQL Databases are still relatively new, and products are still developing
4. Administration: Requires new admin skills and attention to the whole system

## Which one when?
- Recall that databases are built around certain design principles and integrity guarantees
	- Relational databases are very efficient for certain operations, especially when it's all on one local data store
	- NoSQL databases can offer better performance under some conditions
- Relational databases are better for:
	- Data warehousing and analytics - complex query and analysis
	- Fixed structured data
	- Multi row transactions
	- Complex joins (multi table)
- NoSQL databases are better for:
	- Real world graph structures
	- Complex multidimensional data
	- Large collections of unstructured data
	- Real time analytics
	- Evolving distributed applications

## Design and Development Load
- Relational databases invest a lot of time at the design phase, but then can depend upon the integrity guarantees and domain specifications to reduce load later on
- NoSQL databases are very easy to setup but more load has to be put into using the API correctly and not violating too many constraints
	- NoSQL's use of eventual consistency can provide challenges in a real environment and your application needs to be able to cope
