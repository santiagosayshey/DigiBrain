## What is Statistics?
- Field of statistics deals with collecting, organising, summarising, analysing and making decisions from data
- Descriptive statistics focuses on collecting, organising, and describing data using summarisation, tables and graphs
- Inferential statistics lets us use samples of a population to help estimate the parameters of that population and make decisions about it

### Descriptive Statistics
- This includes things like:
	- The average age of your classmates
	- Your height
	- The number of people in your class with brown eyes
	- How much rainfall Adelaide has in January

### Terminology
- We collection information about *elements* or *subjects*
- We use the term *variable* here to mean characteristics that will take different values for different elements or subjects (such as height)
- The value of the variable is a *measurement* or an observation
- Variables can be *Qualitative* (names or labels - eye colour, oldest sibling) or *Quantitative* (numerical - age, height)

#### Types of Variables

### *Inferential Statistics*
- Work on a population, a set of elements that contains (at least) one we're interested in
- We use sampling to infer information about the rest of the population
- A sample is just a subset of the overall population

#### *Random Variables*
- A random variable is a variable whose values depend on a random phenomenon
- A discrete random variable only takes discrete or countable values
- A continuous random variable can take any numerical value
- Think of it as a set of possible values from a random experiment

## Entropy
- In information theory, entropy is the average level of uncertainty possible in the outputs of a random variable
- If we know how the values of our random variable change, because we know how probable they are to occur, then we can determine how much information is provided (transmitted) for a given outcome
- When an event is known to have occurred, it has zero entropy
