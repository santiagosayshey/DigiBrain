- Occurs when a secure or closed system reveals information to people not authorised to receive it
- Participants
	- Closed System - the thing you are keeping from everybody
	- Threat Vectors - loopholes through which people can access the closed system
	- Eavesdropper - someone who wants the leaked information

## Threat Vectors
- Anything that can leak sensitive information passively
	- Attribute names
	- Error messages
	- Data retrieval times
	- Network Traffic
	- Code comments
- Anything that can be actively targeted
	- Network
	- Users
	- Applications
	- Hardware

## Impact of Leakage
- Information theory tells us that the surprise value of data increases the information we gain
	- Every piece of data that can be observed from our system leaks information
	- If you leak the first letter of a suburb name, an X indicates it can only be one possibility, a `Z 1 1`
	- Everything in an error message or page can provide information
	- The more bits you leak, the more information an eavesdropper has **and can then derive**
	- Even the fact of a message can give things away

## Impact on System Design
- Access control
- Encryption of Data
- Scrubbing error messages
- Careful choice of keys
- Defining the attack surface
- Countermeasures

##### Examples

1. 
```
Your postcode storage system has a configuration error and accidentally leaks the third digit of the stored postcode, along with the initials of the people who your system has associated with that postcode

How would you determine the significance of this leakage?
```

- Recreate the leakage and determine what other information can be derived from it
- The more information that leaks, the higher the significance


2.
```
Someone is watching a network kiosk where people use your software. For security reasons, your systems programmers login credentials are not cached or distributed and have to be retrieved from a central database. Why might this tell the observer who your systems team are if they use the network kiosk?

List your assumptions.
```

- Assuming that the network kiosk reveals the Ip addresses of all incoming / outgoing data, the observer might be able to tell who is receiving credentials to login and therefore, exposing members of that systems team
