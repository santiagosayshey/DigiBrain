## What is a Non Relational Database?
- A database that is not modelled on the tabular relations used in relational databases
- Often called NoSQL but it's possible that they still use some SQL but on a different storage model
- Often used for big data and real time web-based (distributed) applications
- Different requirements drive different designs

### Why Change?
- Databases are built around certain design principles and integrity guarantees
- Relational databases are very efficient for certain operations, especially when it's all on one local data store
- Distributed databases introduce new problems
	- Internet unreliability
	- Time taken for changes to be recognised
	- Parallel operations over which we have little control
- New problems drive new designs to arrive at new solutions

### The CAP Theorem
- There are three things we would love a distributed data store to be able to do:

1. Consistency - every time we read, we get the most recent write to the store, or an error
2. Availability - Every request receives a response, although it may not be the most current data
3. Partition Tolerance - Everything will keep working, even if an arbitrary number of messages are dropped or delayed by the network that connects the nodes

- The CAP Theorem says that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than 2 out of the 3 at the same time

## NoSQL Databases
- Often relax the consistency requirement to allow for greater availability, partition tolerance and speed
- Eventual Consistency
	- Database changes will be sent to all distributed nodes *eventually*
	- It's worth noting that this is often in the region of milliseconds
	- Your query may return slightly old data

### SQL Databases
- SQL databases also struggle when distributed
	- Referential integrity checks cant span databases on the same system, let alone remotely
	- Adding more nodes to support an SQL database can be challenging because we can't guarantee referential integrity

### Types of NoSQL Databases
- Document Store (MongoDB)
	- Documents encapsulate the data using standard formats and encoding such as JSON
	- Unique keys
	- Documents in the same collections can have fields in any order
- Object Database (Objectivity / DB)
	- Object oriented rather than table oriented, usually built to work with an OO language
- Key / Value Store (associative) (Apache Ignite)
	- Uses a map or dictionary to store key value pairs, where the keys are unique
- Graph (Apache Giraph)
	- When your data looks like a graph, a graph DB stores elements connected by a finite number of relationsSZS
