```
Transparent sharding automatically splits the database across a number of nodes. What is the problem that this introduces? And can you propose an algorithmic solution?
```

Transparent sharding introduces challenges such as data consistency, complex query operations, rebalancing shards, and choosing an effective shard key. An algorithmic solution like consistent hashing can help by distributing data evenly across shards and minimizing reorganization when nodes change, but it doesn't fully address transaction consistency or complexity in cross-shard queries.

```
Google Spanner is a NewSQL database that uses GPS based timestamps and version data. What will version data help to guarantee for data reads? Why do you think hardware base time is so important to spanner?
```

- Google Spanner utilizes version data, which is essentially timestamping data at the time of write, to help guarantee external consistency and provide a global ordering of transactions in the database. This means that reads will see a consistent view of the data, respecting the chronological order of transactions across the entire distributed database, even across multiple global locations.
