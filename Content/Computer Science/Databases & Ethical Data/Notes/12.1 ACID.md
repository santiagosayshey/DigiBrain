## RDBMS
- Relational database management systems
- Tables of data joined by data relations - the sql model  
- Only efficient if the transactions are ACID transactions

### ACID
- Atomicity
	- The guarantee that all steps of a transactions will / wont occur
	- Both parts of the transaction must complete otherwise the transaction fails, and we need to be able to revert it

- Consistency
	- Data has to meet all validation rules
	- In the example, we use A+B=100 as a constraint to validate a transaction
- Isolation
	- Transactions do not affect each other
- Durability
	- If a transaction IS successful, we want the database to stay like this and not revert back to a prior state

### Implementing ACID
- Locking
- Distributed Transactions
##### Examples
```
You are told that a transaction has gone through successfully. There is still a possible risk to the Durability, what is it?
```

- Some sort of crash occurs that causes data loss. No backups are kept that are able to restore a prior version

```
From your understanding of Von Neumann architecture, how easy is it to implement atomicity in hardware?
```

Implementing atomicity in hardware, especially in systems based on Von Neumann architecture, is challenging. This difficulty arises because ensuring that complex operations are completed entirely or not at all requires sophisticated control mechanisms, error handling, and memory management, which can significantly complicate hardware design and impact system performance.

This often requires temporary registers which hold values that are needed in memory that do not need to be stored
