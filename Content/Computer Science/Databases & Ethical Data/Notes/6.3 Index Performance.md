## Cost of Indexing
- Additional storage
- Additional computation
- Maintenance
- Often need multiple indexes

## Benefits Of Indexing
- No table scanning required
- Can identify the page needed quickly
- Cluster index quickly finding all matching records
	- Best when the cluster field has a low number of values
- Indexes help in estimating memory sizes and improve optimisation 

## Should I Index?
- It depends...

##### Examples

```
We often use indexes to find the record id in the database and then extract that record. On some occasions, there is enough information contained in the index to answer our query. Discuss the impact this would have on performance and provide an example of a query where the index is potentially enough.
```

- We can have faster I/O times in accessing data

```sql
SELECT Genre FROM Books WHERE Author = 'J.K. Rowling';
```

If there's an index on the `Author` and `Genre` columns together (a composite index), then that index alone has enough information to answer the query. The database system can look up "J.K. Rowling" in the index and directly retrieve the list of genres without ever touching the main `Books` table. This would make the query much faster, especially if the `Books` table is large.

```
Give an example of both an equality-based query and a range-based query. Which 1 of this would be most suitable for a hash index?
```

- Equality based:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = 1; 
```

- Range Based:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books where id > 1;
```

- Equality based is most suitable for a hash index since they can quickly pinpoint the location of a specific value using it's hash
- For range based, B trees are better
