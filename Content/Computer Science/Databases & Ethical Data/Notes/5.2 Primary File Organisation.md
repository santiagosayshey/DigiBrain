- We would like to be able to store a single file inside only 1 block, so that we can keep it entirely within a cache

## Types of Files

### Heap Files
- Start with a file and just add records to the end of it
	- Often called "files of unordered records"
	- Very efficient to add new records
	- Inefficient to search (linear search)
	- Inefficient delete
		- Search
		- Load into memory
		- Delete record (possible leaving holes in the file)
	- Needs periodic reorganisation to reclaim lost space
	- May create sorted copies for particular operations

### Sorted Files
- Records are added to the file based on a field, the ordering field
	- Reading in ordering key order is very efficient
	- Key order adjacent records will be in the same block
		- We can use binary search to search over the sorted records
			- And we can even extend this to the blocks in which records are stored within files
		- Insertion and deletion are expensive
			- Insert: find location, increase amount of space and add new record
				- May need to move a lot of records along to make room (think about arrays)
			- Delete is similar to the unordered case, but locating the record is faster

### Hashed Files
- A hash function is used to calculate the address of the record, using the value of an attribute of set of attributes
	- The output determines the location to use for storage and hence retrieval
	- This reduces the search down to one block, which can be easily loaded into memory
	- But has possibility of collision, where multiple records collide with each other - this has to be managed
	- Want to keep has table 70 -90 % full at all times

### B+ Trees
- A B+ tree is a balanced tree
	- Every path from root to each leaf is the same length
	- Each node has between n/2 and n children, where n is the same for every node of the tree
	- Some insertion and deletion overhead
	- No maintenance and deletion overhead
	- B+ Trees use redundant storage of search keys to help index the leaf nodes
	- Performance much better than heap and sorted, and generally better than hashed storage

##### Examples

```
You have an unsorted file storage for 100 records. If it takes 1 second to examine each record, answer the following questions:

1. How long, on average will it take to find a record that is in there.

2. How long will it take to find a record that is not there
```

1. It's a 1/100 chance that the current record in the search is the desired record. For each record at index `n`, it will take `n` seconds to search up to that record

- We add each of the probabilities and then divide by the total number of possibilities - 100


$$ \text{average time} = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 100}{100} $$

The sum of the first \(100\) natural numbers is:
$$ \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $$
Where \( n = 100 \).

$$ \text{Sum} = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2} = 5050 $$

$$ \text{Average time} = \frac{5050}{100} = 50.5 \text{ seconds} $$

2. To know that the file is not there, we must verify that each record is not the one we want. This means we need to search through each record in the file. For n records, it will take `n` seconds
= 100 seconds

```
You have an ordered file organisation. Explain how you could use binary search to improve the performance of searching and maintenence. Explain why binary search words in this case. 
```

- Binary search works by halving the sample size and recursively searching each half until you find the desired record. 
	- Instead of searching in linear time, it is now logarithmic
	- Insertion and deletion works similarly, but is reduced to linear time
- Binary search works because the files are ordered, this means we can halve the sample size each search and determine if the file we are looking for is less or more than the half point
