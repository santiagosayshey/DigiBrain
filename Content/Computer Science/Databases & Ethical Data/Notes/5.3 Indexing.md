- Auxiliary access structures that speed up retrieval in response to certain search conditions
- Typically provide secondary access paths
- Change the way we access records without changing physical placement
- Efficient access to records based on the indexing field
- Any attribute can be used to create an index
- Multiple indexes are common 

## Types of Indexes
- Single level Indexes (Sequential Files)
- Multi level indexes (tree based structures)
- Hash-based indexes

### Single Level

#### Primary Indexes
- Single level ordered index
	- Ordered file where records are fixed length with two attributes
	- First attribute is the same type as the ordering key attribute of the data
	- Second attribute is the pointer to a disk block (a block address)
	- If an index is dense:
		- We have an index entry for each search key value (hence every record)
	- If an index is sparse:
		- We have an entry for only some of the entries, not for each key
	- Primary keys are sparse and only have entries for each disk block

```
Imagine you have a bookshelf full of books. Each book has a unique number, let's call it a "Book ID".

Now, you also have a small notebook where you've listed all the Book IDs in order, and next to each ID, you've written the exact position of that book on the shelf.

This notebook is like a "Primary Index". It's a quick guide to find any book based solely on its unique Book ID.
```

#### Clustering Indexes
- We can order indexes on a non key field that does not have a distinct value for each record; this is called a **clustering field**
	- We can create clustering indexes to speed up retrieval for records that have the same value for the clustering field
	- Remember! Primary indexes need each value to be distinct!
	- A clustering index is an ordered field with two attributes (field)
		- First is of the same type as the clustering field
		- Second field is a block pointer
	- There is an index entry for each value of the clustering field

```
Now, imagine you have a different bookshelf where books are grouped by their genre - like mystery, fantasy, or history. Within each genre, the books aren't in any specific order. So, if you're looking for mystery books, they are all together in one section, but they aren't ordered by their Book IDs.

You then have another notebook where you've listed all the genres, and next to each genre, you've noted down where those genre books start on the bookshelf. So if you're looking for a mystery book, you'd go to the "mystery" section in your notebook, see where that section starts on the bookshelf, and then search that section.

This notebook is like a "Clustering Index". It groups data (or books in our case) by a certain characteristic (genre) but doesn't detail every single item within that group.
```

##### Issues
- Both of these indexes are ordered
	- We will still have issues with insertion and deletion
	- A primary indexed can require a lot of index adjustment after insertion or deletion
	- A clustering index can use a separate block for each value, which allows local growth and deletion without major maintenance to the whole storage system

#### Secondary Indexes
- We can choose to have indexes based on things other than the primary key, but this requires us to:
	- Identify what the secondary key is that we're using
		- Either a candidate key with unique values in every record
		- Or a nonkey with possibly duplicate values
	- Produce a secondary index of two fields, where the first is the secondary key entry and the second is a pointer to a block of pointers to memory
	- The secondary index can require the correct block to be loaded into memory and then searched quickly for the target in the file system
	- If there are distinct values for each secondary key, this is a dense index

```
Imagine you create a third notebook. In this notebook, you list all the authors alphabetically. Next to each author's name, you write down the Book IDs of all the books they've written. Now, when you want to find all the books by a particular author, you just check this notebook, get the Book IDs, and then directly go to those books on your shelf.

This third notebook acts as a "Secondary Index". It allows you to search and access data based on attributes other than the primary key (Book ID) or the clustering attribute (genre).
```

### Multi level 
- We want to reduce the part of the index that we continue to search and reduce the search space much faster
- The first level of a multi level index is an ordered file with a distinct value for each key
- We can create a primary index for this first level, which we call the second level. Because it is a primary index. we can provide one entry for each block of the first level, where block size is determined by the blocking factor (fan out)
- But because the second level is also a primary index, we can keep doing this over and over until we no long need more than block of disk storage
- The level where we are down to one block is referred to as the top

```
Imagine a book: If it only has a few chapters, you can simply list those chapters in the table of contents (TOC) and quickly find what you're looking for. But what if your book has hundreds or thousands of chapters? A TOC that lists every single chapter might become unwieldy. Instead, you might have a main TOC that lists parts or sections of the book, and then each part has its own TOC for its chapters. This is essentially a two-level index: the main TOC and the sub-TOCs.
```

##### Examples

```
You are writing an index for a cookbook and want to write a program that will make it easy to find all of the recipes that use avocadoes. What sort of index do you think you would use to do it efficiently?
```

- A clustering  index for main ingredients, each ingredient points to a block containing recipes for each ingredient
- Within the avocado block, have multiple pointers that point to each recipe that contains avocado

```
You have 30,000 distinct words to index and your blocking factor is 68 index entries per block, which is also your fan out. How many levels will your multilevel index have and which level is the top?
```

$$ \begin{align*}
\text{Level 1:} & \ \frac{30,000}{68} \approx 441.18 \ (\text{rounded up to 442 blocks}) \\
\text{Level 2:} & \ \frac{442}{68} \approx 6.5 \ (\text{rounded up to 7 blocks}) \\
\end{align*}
$$
- 2 levels
