- Four fundamental approaches
	- Source coding (compression)
	- Channel coding (data correction)
	- Cryptographic coding
	- Line coding

## Source Coding
- Removing redundancy from data to make it smaller (preferably) without losing information
- Consider a random variable X, where X can be A or B with equal likelihood
- Data will be strings of words over the alphabet of X
- Words look like: AAABABABABAABAABBA
- We could replace long strings with other text, so `AAAAAAAAb `becomes `A(8)B`, 5 characters instead of 9 - with no loss
