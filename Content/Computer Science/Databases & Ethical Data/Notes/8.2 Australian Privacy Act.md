```

- 10 and 13

```
The fundamental principles for any code of conduct, the justice, fairness, benefit and non harmfulness. How does informed consent support any or all of these principles?
```

- Informed consent is telling someone exactly what is going to happen and asking for their consent in their interaction with the situation
- Informed consent allows people to opt out of situations where each of these principles are harmful to the person in question
