## What is Information Theory?
- The study of digital information, namely it's:
	- Quantification - how it's measured / represented
	- Storage - how we look after it
	- Transmission - how we send it

### Shannonâ€™s Model

- We need to ask the question:
	- How can I ensure that the message that is sent, is the message that is received
	- In particular, how can we be sure that my information is not affected by noise
	- This is usually done by encoding the information being sent to know if something has been changed

### Compression
- We can compress information to reduce transmission time and reduce the bandwidth needed to send the information
	- We can do this via:
		- Lossless compression - Reducing the amount of information by removing all the things that are unimportant
			- Examples include - FLAC (audio file that removes bits from silence and higher frequency sounds above human hearing)
		- Lossless compression - Reducing the all around quality of information but still keeping all the important pieces together
			- Examples include - MP3 (audio file that removes bits from silence and further reduces frequency of sounds that can be heard but are largely unimportant)
