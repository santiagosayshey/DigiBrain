> ***What is ChatGPT?***

To answer this question, it's essential to first define a few key ideas related to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

***Artificial Intelligence*** is a subset of Computer Science that focuses on replicating human intelligence in machines. This is achieved through an engineered system that is designed to learn from various inputs and make decisions based on their interpretation of these inputs.

_**Machine Learning**_, a branch of AI, uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions based on that data.

_**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**_ is another branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Many of its tasks, such as language comprehension and generation, often harness machine learning techniques to enhance their capabilities.

_**Large Language Models (LLMs)**_ are a type of generative AI that are specifically designed to process and generate human-like text to solve NLP problems. 

***ChatGPT*** is an ***LLM*** built by OpenAI that aims to understand and generate text in a conversational manner.

> ***What Does ChatGPT Do?***

ChatGPT stands as an advanced conversational interface, designed to replicate human-like dialogue experiences. It answers inquiries, addresses follow-up questions, challenges inaccuracies, and executes tasks like text composition, code generation, and even image creation. Its intuitive and approachable user interface mimics familiar messaging paradigms, making it user-friendly and adaptable to varied interactive scenarios.

Despite its wide-ranging capabilities, ChatGPT is not without its constraints. Inherently, it's bound to the knowledge it was last trained on and does not have the capability to proactively fetch real-time information or browse the internet. This limitation means that, at times, it may not offer the most up-to-date insights or might struggle with complex or unconventional questions. While plugins like Wolfram Alpha can augment its computational and data querying abilities, users should be aware that, due to its reliance on vast datasets of human language, ChatGPT can occasionally generate responses that might be perceived as biased or even offensive. As with all AI tools, user discretion and awareness of these limitations are essential.


> ***A Brief History of Large Language Models***

- **Early Beginnings**:  
The journey into generative AI began as early as the 1960s, with Joseph Weizenbaum's chatbot ELIZA serving as an early exemplar of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

- **Challenges and ANNs**:  
Though the first Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) emerged in the 1940s, they were stymied by hurdles such as computational limitations and gaps in comprehending the brain's biological intricacies.

- **Backpropagation and Training**:  
The 1980s heralded a significant shift with the introduction of the backpropagation algorithm. Prior to its advent, training Neural Networks was an intricate endeavor. However, backpropagation revolutionized this, streamlining the training process by efficiently calculating the gradient of the error in relation to the neuron-associated parameters.

- **Emergence of VAEs**:  
2013 marked another pivotal moment when Kingma and Welling showcased Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in their work, "Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes". These generative models, rooted in variational inference, innovatively employed a probabilistic interpretation of latent space.

- **Introduction of GANs**:  
A year thereafter, Ian Goodfellow presented Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These networks operate on a principle where a generator aims to produce data deceptive enough to be deemed real by a discriminator, which simultaneously endeavors to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit data.

- **Transformers and the Advent of LLMs**:  
A landmark achievement came in 2017 with the unveiling of the Transformer architecture by Google's researchers. These Transformers laid the groundwork for monumental language models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and subsequently the Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) series by OpenAI, with GPT-3 forming the foundation for ChatGPT.

- **Generative AI in the Limelight**:  
By 2022, generative AI had captured mainstream attention, democratizing powerful AI models for the masses. This shift allowed individuals and entities alike to tap into the potential of generative AI without necessitating expertise as a data scientist or machine learning engineer.

> ***Training ChatGPT***

ChatGPT's training followed a two-step process: pre-training and fine-tuning.

**1. Pre-training**:

- ChatGPT's foundational knowledge is built from a large and diverse collection of texts. Key among these sources is the Common Crawl dataset, which holds close to a trillion words.
- This data was further refined by:
    - Filtering it to match high-quality reference materials.
    - Removing redundant information to ensure the model didn't over-learn from repeated content.
    - Incorporating additional top-tier datasets to enhance the richness of the training material.
- Specifically, OpenAI added data scraped from various internet sources over extended periods, like the expanded WebText dataset, as well as content from two large internet-based book collections (Books1 and Books2) and the English Wikipedia.

**2. Fine-tuning**:

- Building upon this base, fine-tuning tailored ChatGPT specifically for conversational abilities using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
- AI trainers crafted dialogue scenarios, acting as both the user and AI, to generate a rich, conversation-focused dataset. 
- Further refinement used a reward model where multiple responses generated by the model were ranked based on quality. Trainers compared and ranked these to guide the learning process.
