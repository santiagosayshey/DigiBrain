## Prompt

```
We are sending a message in bits along a communications channel. There is not much noise but there is a 1/10,000 chance that any bit will be corrupted.
```

## Questions

```
1. Give an example of bit-wise corruption on ASCII text sent in binary
```

- In ASCII, we represent characters in binary. For example, the letter A in binary is `10000001`.
- If we were to transmit this number and bit wise corruption was to occur, some  of the bits that represents that binary number would change - for example `10000011`, which is the letter C

```
2. Is 1/10,000 a noisy channel? Explain with reference to real examples
```

- yes! A single bit is enough to change the binary number represented to something completely different to the original number
- For a network of such a scale, it's expected that the error rate should be 1 in a billion

```
3. Is the channel noise the only source of potential error? Give examples
```

- no! There could be issues in any of the different mediums that the information passes through
