## Prompt

```
The DNA of living things is made up of nucleotides. Each sugar in a nucelotide has a nitrogen base attached to it. There are four different types of nitrogen bases found in DNA. They include adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). In humans, these occur roughly equally.
