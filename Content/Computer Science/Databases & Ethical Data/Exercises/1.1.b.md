## Prompt
```
I have a box of 100 balls. 40 have only a red stripe, 40 have only a blue stripe, 20 have both red and blue stripes. Let's assume I can't see into the box.
```

## Questions

```
1. I pull a ball from the box. What is the probability that it has at least a red stripe?
```

Here, the balls with at least a red stripe would include those with only a red stripe (40 balls) and those with both blue and red stripes (20 balls). That's a total of 60 balls out of 100. So the probability is 60/100 = 0.6 or 60%.

I put that first ball back and mix them up. I pull another ball. What is the probability that it has a blue stripe if my friend tells me it has at least a red stripe?
