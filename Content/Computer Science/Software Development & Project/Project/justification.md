Our software architecture is designed to support rapid MVP development while ensuring consistency and quality. The use of Docker containerization addresses the "it works on my machine" problem, enabling the team to focus on core features. The frontend stack (React, Tailwind CSS, Vite) facilitates quick prototyping and iterative development. The backend (Python, Flask, InfluxDB, Grafana) offers a low barrier to entry and specialized tools for time-series data. Our tooling choices (Git, VS Code, linting tools, GitHub) create a comprehensive environment that supports collaboration and maintains high standards. This architecture balances quick development with scalability and maintainability, aligning with MVP principles while laying a foundation for future growth. The modular design allows for independent scaling of components as needed.
