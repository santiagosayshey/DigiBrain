> - Ensures clear understanding between stakeholders and developers
> - Provides a reference point for project scope and goals
> - Helps in estimating resources, time, and costs
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation
> - Reduces misunderstandings and potential rework


> [!idea] Requirements Documentation
> Requirements documentation serves as an **official statement of what is required in a project**. It takes various forms depending on the development methodology:
> 
> 1. **Agile Documentation**:
>    - **User Stories**:
>      - Format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
>      - Prioritized and updated throughout development
>    - **Storage Options**:
>      - Task boards (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello)
>      - Wikis (e.g., Confluence, GitHub Wiki)
>      - Specialized tools (e.g., Aha!, ProductPlan)
>    - **Characteristics**:
>      - Lightweight and flexible
>      - Easily updatable to reflect changing priorities
>      - Often linked directly to development tasks
> 
> 2. **Traditional Documentation (SRS)**:
>    - **Comprehensive document detailing**:
>      - User requirements: What the system should do from a user's perspective
>      - System requirements: Technical specifications of how the system will meet user needs
>    - **Storage Options**:
>      - Version-controlled documents (e.g., Word docs in SharePoint)
>      - Wikis (e.g., Confluence, MediaWiki)
>      - Requirements management tools (e.g., IBM DOORS, Jama)
>    - **Characteristics**:
>      - More formal and structured
>      - Provides a complete overview of the system
>      - Often used in regulated industries or for complex systems


> [!consider] Validation vs. Verification: A Scope Perspective
> The key difference between validation and verification lies in their scope:
> 
> **Validation**:
> - Broader scope
> - Focuses on the entire project or system
> - Answers: "Are we building the right product?"
> 
> **Verification**:
> - Narrower scope
> - Focuses on specific requirements or components
> - Answers: "Are we building the product, right?"
> 
> Both processes use requirements documentation, but at different levels:
> - Validation uses high-level requirements and project goals
> - Verification uses detailed specifications and technical requirements

> [!example] Validation vs. Verification
> Consider a project to build a mobile banking app:
> 
> **Validation Example**:
> - Requirement: "Users can transfer money between accounts"
> - Validation Question: Does this feature actually solve users' needs for managing their finances? [Functional]
> - Process: User interviews, prototyping, beta testing
> 
> **Verification Example**:
> - Requirement: "Money transfers should complete within 5 seconds"
> - Verification Question: Does our implemented transfer function consistently meet the 5-second requirement? [Non Functional]
> - Process: Performance testing, code reviews, system tests
> 
> Validation ensures the app meets real user needs, while verification confirms it meets specified technical requirements.

> [!idea] Requirements Documentation Process
> Effective requirements documentation involves several key steps:
> 
> 1. **Define Properties**: 
>    - Who: Identify all stakeholders, from end-users to developers
>    - When: Establish project timelines and milestone deadlines
>    - Roles: Clearly define responsibilities for team members
>    - Status: Track the progress of each requirement (e.g., proposed, approved, implemented)
> 
> 2. **Define Goals**: Clearly articulate what the project aims to achieve, providing a guiding vision for all stakeholders
> 
> 3. **Define Need**: Explain the problem or opportunity the project addresses, justifying its existence
> 
> 4. **List Assumptions**: Document underlying beliefs or conditions that influence the project, helping to prevent misunderstandings
> 
> 5. **Create User Stories**: Capture requirements from the user's perspective, typically in the format "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
> 
> 6. **User Interactions and Designs**: Outline expected user experiences, possibly including wireframes or prototypes
> 
> 7. **Questions**: Compile uncertainties or areas needing clarification, promoting proactive problem-solving
> 
> 8. **Scope Limitations**: Clearly state what the project will not include, helping to manage expectations and prevent scope creep

> [!consider] Documentation Best Practices
> To ensure effectiveness, requirements documentation should:
> 
> - **Complement Task Boards**: 
>   Example: Use Confluence for detailed user stories, linking to corresponding GitHub issues
> 
> - **Remain Flexible**: 
>   Example: Use version control for documentation, allowing easy updates as requirements change
> 
> - **Serve as Information Hub**: 
>   Example: Create a centralized wiki with links to all project-related documents and resources
> 
> - **Be Unambiguous**: 
>   Example: Instead of "The system should be fast", write "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds"
> 
> - **Maintain Consistency**: 
>   Example: Use a glossary to ensure terms like "user" or "admin" have consistent meanings throughout
> 
> - **Be Verifiable**: 
>   Example: "The password reset function shall email a reset link within 30 seconds of request 99% of the time"
> 
> - **Link to Issues**: 
>   Example: In GitHub, tag issues with "REQ-001" to link them to requirement #001 in the SRS
> 
> - **Use "Shall" for Mandates**: 
>   Example: "The system shall encrypt all passwords" (mandatory) vs. "The system should support dark mode" (optional)


> [!idea] Plan-Driven Documentation Structure
> A comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) typically includes:
> 
> 1. **Preface**: Outlines document purpose, scope, and intended audience
> 2. **Introduction**: Provides project overview, objectives, and context
> 3. **Glossary**: Defines key terms and acronyms used throughout the document
> 4. **User Requirements Definition**: Describes high-level user needs and expectations
> 5. **System Architecture**: Outlines the overall structure and major components of the system
> 6. **System Requirements Specification**: Details functional and non-functional requirements
> 7. **System Evolution**: Discusses potential future changes or expansions
> 8. **Index**: Facilitates navigation through the document
> 
> This structure ensures comprehensive coverage of both user needs and technical specifications, providing a clear roadmap for development in plan-driven projects.

> [!consider] Changing Requirements
> **Requirements often evolve during project development** due to various factors:
> - New customer input
> - Feasibility changes
> - Dependency updates or new tooling
> 
> When requirements change:
> - Notify customers if change wasn't initiated by them
> - Add new user stories or non-functional requirements
> - Update existing stories as needed

> [!idea] Time Management in Requirements Engineering
> Effective time management is crucial:
> 
> - **Routine Work Sessions**: 
>   Schedule regular times for requirements work
>   Example: Block out 2 hours every Tuesday and Thursday for requirements analysis
> 
> - **Flexible Planning**: 
>   Plan for the future without rigid commitments
>   Example: Outline potential features for next quarter, but be open to reprioritization
> 
> - **Thematic Sprints**: 
>   Organize work around specific goals or themes
>   Example: Dedicate a sprint to improving user authentication features
> 
> - **Purposeful Meetings**: 
>   Ensure each meeting has clear objectives
>   Example: Hold bi-weekly requirement review sessions with defined agendas and outcomes

> [!summary] Requirements Management Overview
> Effective requirements management involves:
> 
> 1. **Gathering**: 
>    - Collect input from stakeholders
>    - Research industry standards and best practices
> 
> 2. **Documenting**: 
>    - Use clear, unambiguous language
>    - Employ consistent formatting and structure
> 
> 3. **Verifying**: 
>    - Review requirements with stakeholders
>    - Conduct feasibility assessments
> 
> 4. **Managing**: 
>    - Utilize tags for easy categorization and retrieval
>      Example: Use tags like [SECURITY], [PERFORMANCE], [UI] in your documentation system
>    - Create a central page or dashboard to collate information
>      Example: Set up a Confluence page linking to all requirement documents, sorted by project phase or priority
> 
> This structured approach ensures requirements are well-organized, traceable, and adaptable to change throughout the project lifecycle.
