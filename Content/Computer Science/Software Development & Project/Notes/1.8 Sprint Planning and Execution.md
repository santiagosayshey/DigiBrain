> [!consider] User Story Points
> Story points are a **unit of measure for expressing the overall size and complexity of a user story.** They are used for estimation and prioritization in Agile development.
>
> Key considerations:
> - **Relative sizing**: Points are relative to other stories, not absolute measures
> - **Complexity, not time**: Consider effort, complexity, and uncertainty, not just duration
> - **Team consensus**: Points should be agreed upon by the entire development team
> - **Fibonacci sequence**: Often used for point values (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...)
> - **Velocity**: Team's average story points completed per sprint, used for sprint planning
>
> Benefits:
> - Facilitates quick estimations
> - Accounts for team differences and varying skill levels
> - Helps in sprint planning and backlog prioritization
>
> Remember: Story points are about estimation, not commitment. They help in planning but shouldn't be used as a strict measure of productivity.

> [!idea] Daily Standup: The Three Questions
> 
> Daily standups, also known as daily scrums, are brief, focused meetings. They center around three key questions:
> 
> 1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
>    - Briefly summarize completed tasks
>    - Focus on work that contributes to the sprint goal
>    - Mention any significant progress or milestones
> 
> 2. **What will I do today?**
>    - Outline planned tasks for the day
>    - Prioritize work that moves the team closer to the sprint goal
>    - Be specific about what you intend to complete
> 
> 3. **Are there any obstacles in my way?**
>    - Identify any blockers or impediments
>    - Briefly describe challenges that may slow progress
>    - This is not for problem-solving, just identification
> 
> Key Points:
> - Keep responses brief and to the point
> - Focus on sprint-related work
> - The meeting should typically last no more than 15 minutes
> - It's not a status report to management, but a **sync among team members**
> - Stand-up (if in person) to keep the meeting short and energized
> 
> Purpose:
> - Align the team on daily progress and goals
> - Identify issues early
> - Promote collaboration and quick problem-solving
> 
> Remember: The Scrum Master facilitates but doesn't lead the standup. Each team member addresses the three questions to the team, not to the Scrum Master or Product Owner.
