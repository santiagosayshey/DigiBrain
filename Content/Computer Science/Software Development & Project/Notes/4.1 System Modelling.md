> [!idea]+ System Models  
> System models help us to **conceptualise a software system**. We take requirements, turn them into a model, and then use this model to help structure our implementation. **System models are like blueprints.** They help us to:  
> - Analyse functionality  
> - Communicate ideas  
> - Design and implement
>  
> They are implemented as graphical representations that abstract specific views or perspectives:  
>  
> - **External:** Showing the system's context or environment  
>   - *Example:* A **Context Diagram** that illustrates how a software system interacts with external entities, such as users, other systems, or devices. This might show an e-commerce platform interacting with payment gateways, shipping services, and customer databases.
>  
> - **Behavioural:** Showing the system's behaviour  
>   - *Example:* A **State Machine Diagram** that details the various states an object or component within the system can be in, and the transitions between these states. For example, a user account might have states like "Active," "Suspended," or "Closed," with transitions triggered by actions such as login attempts or account deletion.
>  
> - **Structural:** Showing the system architecture  
>   - *Example:* A **Class Diagram** in UML that outlines the classes within the system, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. For instance, in a library management system, the diagram might include classes like `Book`, `Member`, and `Loan`, with associations showing that members can borrow books.
>  
> - **Interactive:** Showing how the system and its components interact with its users  
>   - *Example:* A **Sequence Diagram** that captures the interaction between a user and the system over time, often in the form of a series of messages or function calls. In an online shopping system, this could illustrate the sequence of actions when a user adds items to a cart, proceeds to checkout, and completes a purchase.

> [!idea]+ Context Models  
> **Context models** are used to **define the boundaries and interactions between a system and its external environment.** They provide a high-level view of the system in relation to other systems, users, and external entities. Context models help to:
> - Clarify the system's scope by showing what lies inside and outside the system boundary.
> - Identify external dependencies, such as other systems or services the system interacts with.
> - Highlight the interfaces and communication flows between the system and its environment.

> [!idea]+ Data Flow Models  
> **Data flow models** are used to represent **how data moves through a system**, detailing the processes that transform data, the data stores that hold it, and the external entities that interact with it. These models help to:
> - Visualize the flow of information within the system, from input to output.
> - Identify the processes that manipulate data and the data stores that hold it.
> - Understand how different parts of the system interact through the exchange of data.
>
> Data flow models are typically represented using **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**, which consist of the following elements:
> 
> - **Processes:** Represented by circles or ovals, processes depict operations that transform input data into output data. *Example:* In an order processing system, a process might represent the action of validating an order.
> 
> - **Data Stores:** Represented by rectangles (often drawn as parallel lines), data stores are repositories where data is held for later use. *Example:* A database storing customer information.
> 
> - **External Entities:** Represented by rectangles, external entities are outside the system boundary and interact with the system by providing or receiving data. *Example:* A supplier providing inventory data to the system.
> 
> - **Data Flows:** Represented by arrows, data flows indicate the direction of data movement between processes, data stores, and external entities. Each arrow is labeled with the data it carries. *Example:* An arrow labeled "Order Details" flowing from a customer (external entity) to an order validation process.

> [!idea]+ State Machines and State Charts  
> **State machines** and **state charts** are used to model the dynamic behavior of a system by **representing the various states an object or system component can be in and the transitions between these states**. These models help to:
> - Define the different states a system or component can occupy.
> - Show how the system transitions from one state to another based on events or conditions.
> - Visualize the lifecycle of an object or component, including any possible state changes.
>
> State machines are often represented using **State Diagrams** or **State Charts**, which consist of the following elements:
> 
> - **States:** Represented by rounded rectangles, states describe the condition or situation of an object at a particular time. *Example:* In a traffic light system, states might include "Red," "Yellow," and "Green."
> 
> - **Transitions:** Represented by arrows connecting states, transitions indicate the movement from one state to another, usually triggered by events or conditions. *Example:* An arrow from "Green" to "Yellow" labeled "Timer expires" represents the change from a green light to a yellow light when the timer runs out.
> 
> - **Initial State:** Represented by a filled black circle, the initial state indicates where the object or system starts when it begins operation. *Example:* The traffic light system might start in the "Red" state.
> 
> - **Final State:** Represented by a filled black circle with an enclosing circle, the final state indicates the completion of the system's behavior or lifecycle. *Example:* In a simple model, the final state might be when the traffic light system shuts down.
> 
> - **Events/Conditions:** These are often labeled along the transitions to indicate what causes the state change. *Example:* A button press event that causes a vending machine to move from the "Idle" state to the "Processing" state.

> [!idea]+ Data Models  
> **Data models** are used to define **how data is structured, stored, and manipulated within a system**. They provide a blueprint for the organization of data, describing the relationships between different data elements and the rules governing their interactions. Data models help to:
> - Organize data in a consistent and logical manner.
> - Define the structure of databases, including tables, fields, and relationships.
> - Ensure data integrity and consistency across the system.
>
> Data models are typically represented using **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**, which consist of the following elements:
> 
> - **Entities:** Represented by rectangles, entities are objects or concepts that have data stored about them. *Example:* In a university database, entities might include "Student," "Course," and "Instructor."
> 
> - **Attributes:** Represented by ovals connected to entities, attributes describe the properties or characteristics of an entity. *Example:* A "Student" entity might have attributes like "Student ID," "Name," and "Enrollment Date."
> 
> - **Relationships:** Represented by diamonds or lines connecting entities, relationships describe how entities are related to one another. *Example:* A "Student" entity might be connected to a "Course" entity by an "Enrolled In" relationship, indicating which courses a student is taking.
> 
> - **Primary Keys:** Represented by underlined attribute names, primary keys uniquely identify each record within an entity. *Example:* "Student ID" might be the primary key for the "Student" entity.
> 
> - **Foreign Keys:** Represented by dashed lines or attributes, foreign keys create links between entities by referring to primary keys in other entities. *Example:* "Course ID" in an "Enrollment" entity might refer to the primary key in the "Course" entity.

> [!idea]+ Data Dictionaries  
> **Data dictionaries** are comprehensive repositories of information about the data elements within a system. They provide detailed descriptions of each data element, including its name, type, format, and purpose. Data dictionaries help to:
> - Standardize the use of data elements across the system.
> - Provide clear definitions to ensure consistent interpretation of data.
> - Facilitate communication among team members and stakeholders by providing a common understanding of data elements.
>
> A data dictionary typically includes the following information for each data element:
> 
> - **Name:** The name of the data element, used consistently throughout the system. *Example:* "CustomerID"
> 
> - **Type:** The data type of the element, such as integer, string, or date. *Example:* "Integer"
> 
> - **Format:** The format or structure of the data, including any constraints or rules. *Example:* "10-digit number, no leading zeros"
> 
> - **Description:** A brief explanation of what the data element represents. *Example:* "A unique identifier assigned to each customer."
> 
> - **Source:** The origin of the data element, such as a specific database table or external source. *Example:* "Customers table in the Sales database"
> 
> - **Allowed Values:** Any specific values or ranges that the data element can take. *Example:* "Values between 1 and 9999999999"
> 
> - **Relationships:** References to related data elements or entities, such as foreign keys or associations. *Example:* "Linked to Orders table via CustomerID"

> [!idea]+ Object UML  
> **Object UML** (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized modeling language used to **visualize, specify, and document the structure and behavior of object-oriented systems**. It helps in designing and understanding the relationships between objects in a system, allowing for clear communication and planning during development. Object UML is particularly useful in:
> - Defining the structure of classes and their relationships.
> - Modeling object behavior and interactions.
> - Ensuring consistency and clarity in system design.
>
> Object UML diagrams typically include the following elements:
> 
> - **Classes:** Represented by rectangles divided into three sections (name, attributes, methods), classes define the blueprint for objects. *Example:* A "Car" class might have attributes like "make," "model," and "year," with methods like "startEngine()" and "stopEngine()."
> 
> - **Objects:** Represented by rectangles with underlined names, objects are instances of classes. *Example:* An object named "myCar" might be an instance of the "Car" class.
> 
> - **Inheritance:** Represented by a solid line with a closed arrow pointing to the superclass, inheritance models the "is-a" relationship where a subclass inherits attributes and methods from a superclass. *Example:* A "SportsCar" class might inherit from the "Car" class, meaning "SportsCar" is a type of "Car."
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20240813170957.png|500]]
> 
> - **Object Aggregation:** Represented by a solid line with a diamond at the end connected to the aggregate (whole) class, object aggregation models the "has-a" relationship, where one object is composed of or contains other objects. *Example:* A "Library" class might aggregate multiple "Book" objects, indicating that a library "has" books.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20240813171208.png|500]]
> 
> - **Associations:** Represented by lines connecting classes, associations depict relationships between classes. These can include multiplicity (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many) to show how many instances of one class relate to another. *Example:* A "Customer" class might be associated with an "Order" class, indicating that customers can place orders.
> 
> - **Methods and Attributes:** Within class rectangles, methods (functions) and attributes (data fields) describe the behavior and properties of the class. *Example:* In a "Car" class, an attribute might be "color," and a method might be "accelerate()."

> [!idea]+ Interaction Models  
> **Interaction models** are used to **describe how objects or components within a system communicate and collaborate** to achieve specific tasks. They focus on the flow of messages or data between entities, capturing the dynamic aspects of system behavior. Interaction models help to:
> - Visualize the sequence of interactions between objects or components.
> - Understand how different parts of the system work together to perform a function.
> - Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in communication patterns.
>
> Interaction models are typically represented using **Sequence Diagrams** and **Collaboration Diagrams**, which include the following elements:
> 
> - **Objects/Actors:** Represented by rectangles or stick figures (for external actors), these are the entities that participate in the interaction. *Example:* In a user login process, the objects might include "User," "Login Page," and "Authentication Server."
> 
> - **Lifelines:** Represented by dashed vertical lines extending from each object, lifelines indicate the object's existence over time during the interaction. *Example:* The "User" object's lifeline might extend through the entire login process, from entering credentials to receiving confirmation.
> 
> - **Messages:** Represented by arrows between lifelines, messages depict the communication or data exchange between objects. Each message is labeled with the operation or information being sent. *Example:* An arrow from "Login Page" to "Authentication Server" might be labeled "Verify Credentials."
> 
> - **Activation Bars:** Represented by thin rectangles on lifelines, activation bars show the duration during which an object is performing an operation. *Example:* An activation bar on the "Authentication Server" might represent the time taken to check the user's credentials.
> 
> - **Sequence Numbers:** In collaboration diagrams, messages are often numbered to show the order of interactions. *Example:* Message "1" might be the user submitting their login information, followed by message "2," which is the server processing it.
> 
> - **Conditions/Loops:** Represented by rectangular boxes or annotations, these indicate conditional flows or repeating interactions within the sequence. *Example:* A loop might be used to represent repeated attempts to authenticate the user, such as re-entering credentials after a failed attempt.
