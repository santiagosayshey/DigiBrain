> [!idea]+ Version Control Systems
> 
> Version Control Systems (VCS) track file states over time, recording:
> - File contents
> - Timestamps
> - Owner information
> 
> Primarily used for text files, not binary files, due to efficient change tracking.
> 
> Two main types:
> - Distributed (e.g., Git): P2P-based with complete local repositories
> - Centralized: Client-server architecture with a single shared repository

> [!consider]+ Issues with Centralized VCS
> 
> Centralized systems like SVN face challenges:
> - Complex merge conflicts with simultaneous edits
> - Difficulty prioritizing conflicting changes
> - Single point of failure (central server)
> - Limited offline work capabilities

> [!idea]+ Git and Branching
> 
> Git, a distributed VCS, uses branches to:
> - Isolate individual work
> - Manage parallel development
> - Facilitate easier merging and conflict resolution
>
> Branches allow:
> - Isolated feature development
> - Experimentation without affecting the main codebase
> - Streamlined code review and integration

> [!example]+ Git Workflow
> 
> Basic Git commands and their purposes:
>
> | Event | Command | Explanation |
> |-------|---------|-------------|
> | Stage changes | `git add <file>` | Prepare changes for commit |
> | Commit changes | `git commit -m "<message>"` | Create a snapshot of staged changes |
> | Push changes | `git push <remote> <branch>` | Send commits to remote repository |
> | Pull changes | `git pull` | Fetch and merge remote changes |

> [!consider]+ Reverting Code Changes
> 
> Without version control, reverting code would require:
> - Manually saving multiple file versions
> - Implementing a complex file naming and storage system
> - Significant care and experience to manage effectively
>
> Git simplifies this process with standardized commands, making code history management more efficient and less error-prone.
