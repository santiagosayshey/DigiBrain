I understand the instructions and will adhere to them strictly. I will now create the notes based on your outline, focusing on regression testing and release testing.

> [!motivation] Why We Need to Check New Code's Impact
> - **Software Evolution**: As systems grow and change, new code is continuously added.
> - **Potential Conflicts**: New code may inadvertently affect existing, previously tested functionalities.
> - **Risk of Breakage**: Without proper checks, seemingly innocuous changes could introduce bugs in stable parts of the system.
> - **Maintaining Reliability**: Ensuring that the entire system remains functional as it evolves is crucial for software quality.

> [!idea] Regression Testing
> Regression testing is the process of **checking that new code doesn't break existing functionality**.
> 
> **Key Aspects**:
> - Involves rerunning previously passed tests on the updated codebase
> - Ensures existing features still work as expected after changes
> - Can be resource-intensive, especially in agile development environments
> 
> **Process**:
> - Both new and old tests must pass before committing changes
> - Helps maintain system stability throughout development

> [!idea] Release Testing
> Release testing is the **final quality check before making code available to customers**.
> 
> **Characteristics**:
> - Focuses on verifying major requirements
> - Typically uses black-box testing methods
> - Conducted by a separate quality assurance team
> 
> **Key Points**:
> - QA team has no knowledge of internal system workings
> - Aim is to validate system functionality from a user perspective
> - Involves intentionally trying to break the system to uncover defects
> - Uses prepared test cases based on system requirements
> 
> **Requirements-Based Testing**:
> - Derives test cases directly from system specifications
> - Ensures all documented requirements are met before release

> [!example] Requirements-Based Testing for Patient Record App
> Consider a full-stack patient record application with a database:
> 
> 1. **User Authentication**
>    - Test: Attempt login with valid and invalid credentials
>    - Expected: Correct access granted or denied
> 
> 2. **Data Entry**
>    - Test: Input various patient details (name, DOB, medical history)
>    - Expected: Data correctly saved and retrievable
> 
> 3. **Search Functionality**
>    - Test: Search for patients using different criteria
>    - Expected: Accurate and timely results returned
> 
> 4. **Data Privacy**
>    - Test: Attempt unauthorized access to patient records
>    - Expected: Access denied, appropriate error messages displayed
> 
> 5. **System Performance**
>    - Test: Simulate multiple concurrent users performing various operations
>    - Expected: System remains responsive and data integrity maintained

> [!idea] Performance Testing
> Performance testing evaluates **non-functional requirements** related to system performance under various conditions.
> 
> **Key Aspects**:
> - Gradually increases load until system instability
> - Identifies performance bottlenecks and scalability issues
> 
> **Example**:
> - Web application performance test:
>   1. Start with 100 concurrent users
>   2. Increase by 100 users every 5 minutes
>   3. Monitor response times and error rates
>   4. Continue until response time exceeds 3 seconds or error rate surpasses 1%
>   5. Record the maximum sustainable load

> [!idea] Stress Testing
> Stress testing involves **running the system beyond its designed maximum load** to observe failure behavior.
> 
> **Purpose**:
> - Identify how the system fails under extreme conditions
> - Minimize potential damage during unexpected overloads
> 
> **Example**:
> - Database stress test:
>   - Flood system with concurrent write operations
>   - Observe if it gracefully stops accepting new connections
>   - Ensure no data corruption occurs during overload

> [!idea] User Testing
> User testing involves **end users evaluating the system** to improve reliability and usability.
> 
> **Types**:
> 1. **Alpha Testing**:
>    - Users work with developers on-site
>    - Early-stage, controlled environment testing
> 
> 2. **Beta Testing**:
>    - Pre-release version given to select users
>    - Users experiment and report issues in real-world scenarios
> 
> 3. **Acceptance Testing**:
>    - Determines if the product is ready for production deployment
>    - Often conducted by client representatives

> [!idea] Agile Approaches to Quality Assurance
> Agile methodologies incorporate various practices to ensure software quality throughout development.
> 
> **Techniques**:
> - **Pair Programming**:
>   - Two developers work together
>   - One writes code, the other reviews for defects
> - **Continuous Integration**:
>   - Frequent merging of code changes
>   - Automated testing on each integration
> - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
>   - Write tests before implementing features
>   - Ensures code meets requirements from the start

> [!consider] Testing Frameworks
> Testing frameworks **automate the execution of tests**, improving efficiency and consistency.
> 
> **Key Points**:
> - Popular frameworks include pytest (Python), JUnit (Java), and Jest (JavaScript)
> - Enables easy creation and management of test suites
> - Facilitates continuous integration and delivery pipelines

> This diagram illustrates how input data and the code under test interact with the testing framework, which then produces test results based on predefined test cases.
