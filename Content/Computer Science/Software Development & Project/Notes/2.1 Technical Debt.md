> [!consider] Technical Debt
> Technical debt refers to the implied **cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution** now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
> 
> Key aspects of technical debt:
> - Accumulates over time, like financial debt
> - Makes future changes more difficult and time-consuming
> - Can slow down development and increase bugs
> 
> Common sources:
> - Time pressures leading to quick fixes
> - Lack of documentation
> - Insufficient test coverage
> - Outdated dependencies
> - Poor code quality or design
> 
> Impact:
> - Decreased productivity
> - Increased maintenance costs
> - Difficulty in adding new features
> - Potential system instability


> [!idea] Refactoring: Addressing Technical Debt
> Refactoring is the process of **restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior**. It's a key strategy for managing and reducing technical debt.
> 
> Benefits of refactoring:
> - Improves code readability and maintainability
> - Reduces complexity
> - Makes code easier to understand and modify
> - Can improve performance
> 
> Best practices:
> - Refactor continuously, not as a one-time event
> - Use automated tests to ensure behavior doesn't change
> - Refactor in small, manageable steps
> - Document reasons for refactoring

> [!example] Technical Debt Inheritance: Kerbal Space Program 2
> Kerbal Space Program 2 (KSP2) demonstrates the severe consequences of inheriting technical debt in an attempt to save development time.
> 
> Key decision:
> - KSP2 developers chose to build upon the original KSP codebase to accelerate development
> - This decision was made to leverage existing systems and potentially reduce time-to-market
> 
> Inherited issues:
> 1. **Legacy Codebase**:
>    - Accumulated years of technical debt from the original KSP
>    - Architectural limitations became more apparent as they tried to expand the game's scope
> 
> 2. **Persistent Physics Problems**:
>    - "Space Kraken" glitches and physics quirks from the original game persisted
>    - These issues became more pronounced with KSP2's expanded scale
> 
> 3. **Escalating Performance Issues**:
>    - Frame rate drops and stuttering, especially with complex builds
>    - Load times increased dramatically due to expanded game features
> 
> Consequences:
> - Development time significantly exceeded initial estimates
> - Numerous delays and stability issues upon release
> - Developers struggled to implement new features without breaking existing systems
> - Eventually led to halted development and studio closure (Intercept Games)
> 
> Critical lesson:
> The decision to inherit old code to save time backfired dramatically. Instead of accelerating development, it saddled the project with years of accumulated technical debt. By the time the full extent of the problem was realized, it was too late to change course without massive additional investment.
> 
> This case underscores the importance of thoroughly assessing inherited codebases for technical debt before deciding to build upon them, as the perceived time savings can lead to much greater costs and challenges in the long run.
