can we please do notes on project management in the context of software engineering?
- idea - what is it?
	- should you manage individually? or in a group?
	- depends on
		- team size
		- project size and timeline
		- workload
	- dedicated roles have dedicated responsibilities
		- everyone helps each other
		- divide work into tasks
		- ensure job is within budget
		- facilitate teamwork


- idea - project manager
	- they ensure job is on time and within budget
	- acquire resources - space, materials, recruiting, hiring, training,
	- manage the plan of execution
	- monitor progress
	- write reports and presentations
	- table to  compare project engineer, project manager and program manager

- consider - who manages?
	- everyone can manage, but some choose not to. 
	- everyone WILL be managed though, in some way or another

idea- project organisation
- can be formal
	- what are we doing: a goal
	- division of labor: assigning tasks
	- a leader: the person who manages the process - a scrum master
- informal
	- evolving comunnication, nothing set in stone
