> [!idea] Project Management in Software Engineering
> Project management in software engineering involves **overseeing and coordinating the development of software projects.** It encompasses planning, executing, monitoring, and closing projects to achieve specific goals within defined constraints such as time, budget, and quality.

> [!idea] Managing Projects: Individual vs. Group
> - The decision to manage projects individually or in a group depends on various factors:
>   - Team size: Larger teams may require group management for effective coordination.
>   - Project size and timeline: Complex projects with longer timelines often necessitate group management.
>   - Workload: Group management helps distribute the workload evenly among team members.
> - In group management, dedicated roles have specific responsibilities:
>   - Team members collaborate and support each other to achieve project goals.
>   - Work is divided into manageable tasks and assigned to individuals or sub-teams.
>   - Project managers ensure the project stays within budget and meets quality standards.
>   - Effective communication and teamwork are facilitated to foster a productive work environment.

> [!idea] The Role of a Project Manager
> A **project manager is responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards**. Their key responsibilities include:
> - Acquiring necessary resources, such as workspace, materials, and personnel
> - Recruiting, hiring, and training team members
> - Developing and managing the project execution plan
> - Monitoring progress and making adjustments as needed
> - Preparing reports and presentations to communicate project status and outcomes

> [!example] Comparison of Project Roles
> | Role | Focus | Responsibilities |
> |------|-------|-----------------|
> | Project Engineer | Technical aspects | Design, development, testing |
> | Project Manager | Overall project | Planning, execution, monitoring |
> | Program Manager | Multiple projects | Coordination, resource allocation |

> [!consider] Who Manages Projects?
> - While everyone has the potential to manage projects, some individuals may choose not to take on management roles.
> - However, regardless of one's role, everyone in a project will be managed to some extent, either directly or indirectly.
> - Effective project management requires a balance between individual contributions and overall team coordination.

> [!idea] Project Organization
> Project organization can be either formal or informal:
> - Formal organization:
>   - Clearly defined project goal and objectives
>   - Structured division of labor and task assignment
>   - Designated project leader or scrum master to oversee the process
> - Informal organization:
>   - Evolving communication and collaboration among team members
>   - Flexibility in task allocation and decision-making
>   - Adaptability to changing project requirements and circumstances

example - leaders in project organisation
- all leaders ensure:
	- everyone does effective work
	- the project has nessecary resources
	- keeps everyone motivated
	- everyone understands each other
	- the project meets its goal
a table
- project managers:
	- manage risk
	- manage budget
	- non techinical
	- sets timeframes and milestones
- scrum master:
	- removes roadblocks
	- runs scrum meetings
	- improves the agile process for the team
	- ensures goals, scope are understood by devs
	- facilitates agile
	- are technical


idea - leaders and teams
- dont need both a scrum master and project master
- still need a product owner for client related stuff if you have scrum master
- need multiple teams for large software projects
- need to balance communication and development
- time size should not exceed the 2 pizza rule

consider - small teams
- are better because:
	- less communication problems
	- quality standards are easier to achieve
	- can work closer together
	- egoless
	- democratic - small groups
