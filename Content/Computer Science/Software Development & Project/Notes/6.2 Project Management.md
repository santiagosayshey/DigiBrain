> [!idea] Project Management in Software Engineering
> Project management in software engineering involves **overseeing and coordinating the development of software projects.** It encompasses planning, executing, monitoring, and closing projects to achieve specific goals within defined constraints such as time, budget, and quality.

> [!idea] Managing Projects: Individual vs. Group
> - The decision to manage projects individually or in a group depends on various factors:
>   - Team size: Larger teams may require group management for effective coordination.
>   - Project size and timeline: Complex projects with longer timelines often necessitate group management.
>   - Workload: Group management helps distribute the workload evenly among team members.
> - In group management, dedicated roles have specific responsibilities:
>   - Team members collaborate and support each other to achieve project goals.
>   - Work is divided into manageable tasks and assigned to individuals or sub-teams.
>   - Project managers ensure the project stays within budget and meets quality standards.
>   - Effective communication and teamwork are facilitated to foster a productive work environment.

> [!idea] The Role of a Project Manager
> A **project manager is responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards**. Their key responsibilities include:
> - Acquiring necessary resources, such as workspace, materials, and personnel
> - Recruiting, hiring, and training team members
> - Developing and managing the project execution plan
> - Monitoring progress and making adjustments as needed
> - Preparing reports and presentations to communicate project status and outcomes

> [!example] Comparison of Project Roles
> | Role | Focus | Responsibilities |
> |------|-------|-----------------|
> | Project Engineer | Technical aspects | Design, development, testing |
> | Project Manager | Overall project | Planning, execution, monitoring |
> | Program Manager | Multiple projects | Coordination, resource allocation |

> [!consider] Who Manages Projects?
> - While everyone has the potential to manage projects, some individuals may choose not to take on management roles.
> - However, regardless of one's role, everyone in a project will be managed to some extent, either directly or indirectly.
> - Effective project management requires a balance between individual contributions and overall team coordination.

> [!idea] Project Organization
> Project organization can be either formal or informal:
> - Formal organization:
>   - Clearly defined project goal and objectives
>   - Structured division of labor and task assignment
>   - Designated project leader or scrum master to oversee the process
> - Informal organization:
>   - Evolving communication and collaboration among team members
>   - Flexibility in task allocation and decision-making
>   - Adaptability to changing project requirements and circumstances

> [!example] Leaders in Project Organization
> All leaders in a project organization, regardless of their specific roles, ensure that:
> - Everyone in the team is doing effective work and contributing to the project's success
> - The project has the necessary resources, including personnel, equipment, and budget
> - Team members remain motivated and engaged throughout the project lifecycle
> - Effective communication is maintained, ensuring that everyone understands each other and the project goals
> - The project ultimately meets its objectives and delivers the desired outcomes
>
> | Role | Responsibilities |
> |------|------------------|
> | Project Manager | - Manages project risks and budget<br>- Focuses on non-technical aspects<br>- Sets project timeframes and milestones |
> | Scrum Master | - Removes roadblocks and obstacles for the team<br>- Facilitates scrum meetings and improves the agile process<br>- Ensures project goals and scope are understood by developers<br>- Provides technical guidance and support |

> [!idea] Leaders and Teams
> - In most cases, a project does not require both a scrum master and a project manager simultaneously.
> - When working with a scrum master, a product owner is still necessary to handle client-related matters.
> - Large software projects often necessitate multiple teams to manage the complexity and workload effectively.
> - Striking a balance between communication and development is crucial for project success.
> - The "two-pizza rule" suggests that team size should not exceed the number of people who can be fed with two pizzas, ensuring optimal collaboration and efficiency.

> [!consider] Small Teams
> Small teams offer several advantages:
> - Reduced communication problems, as fewer people are involved in discussions and decision-making
> - Easier to maintain quality standards due to closer collaboration and accountability
> - Increased opportunity for team members to work closely together and develop strong relationships
> - Promotes an egoless environment where individuals focus on the project rather than personal agendas
> - Encourages democratic decision-making, as small groups tend to have a more equal distribution of abilities and contributions
> - Allows team members to divide tasks among themselves based on their skills and expertise
>
> However, small teams also face certain challenges:
> - Knowledge transfer can be difficult if a team member leaves, as the remaining members need to absorb and retain more information about the entire system
> - Increased time spent on communication, as each member needs to stay informed about various aspects of the project
> - Potential for single points of failure if critical knowledge or skills are concentrated in a few individuals

> [!idea] Meetings
> Effective meetings in project management should have:
> - A clear purpose and objective, ensuring that the meeting is necessary and productive
> - An agenda outlining the topics to be discussed and the expected outcomes
> - A defined time frame to keep the meeting focused and efficient
> - Active participation from all relevant team members to foster collaboration and decision-making
> - Minutes or notes documenting the key points, decisions, and action items discussed during the meeting
>
> There are two main types of meetings in project management:
> 1. Status meetings: These meetings focus on providing updates on the project's progress, identifying potential issues, and discussing solutions.
> 2. Action meetings: These meetings are held to make decisions, assign tasks, and plan the next steps in the project.

remove the notes on meetings at the end, new idea callouts for:
- status meetings
- brainstorm meetings
- decision meetings


idea - SAMOSAs
- **S**tart and stop meeting promptly
- **A**genda created in advance. no agenda = no meeting
- **M**inutes recorded and send around after meeting. everyone can contribute
- **O**ne speaker at a time. no interruptions
- **S**end material for faster meetings
- **A**ction items at the end of a meeting = what should we do as a result of what we disucssed
- **S**chedule net meeting
