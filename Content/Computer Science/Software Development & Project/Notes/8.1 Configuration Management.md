> [!motivation] The Need for Configuration Management
> As software systems evolve over time, it becomes crucial to effectively manage the changes made to these systems. Without proper configuration management:
> - Developers may waste time modifying the wrong version
> - The location of the source code may be lost
> - The wrong version may be delivered to customers
> - Bugs that are no longer relevant may be fixed
> 
> Configuration management aims to control the costs and effort involved in making changes to a software system by managing evolving software products.

> [!idea] Configuration Management Activities
> Configuration management involves several key activities:
> - **Change management**: Controlling and managing change requests to ensure they are implemented effectively
> - **Version management**: Keeping track of different versions of software components and systems
> - **Release management**: Planning and distributing new system releases to customers
> - **System building**: Compiling and linking software components into an executable system
> 
> These activities are supported by the development and application of policies, procedures, standards, and tools to manage an evolving software product.

> [!example] Change Management Procedure
> The change management procedure typically follows these steps:
> 1. Request change by completing a change request form
> 2. Analyze the change request
> 3. If the change is valid:
>    - Assess how the change might be implemented
>    - Assess the change cost
>    - Submit the request to the change control board (CCB)
>    - If the change is accepted:
>      - Make changes to the software
>      - Submit software changes for quality approval
>      - Create a new system version
> 4. If the change is not valid or not accepted by the CCB, reject the change request
>
> The change request form records the proposed change, the requestor, the reason for the change, and the urgency of the change. It also documents the change evaluation, impact analysis, change cost, and recommendations.

> [!consider] Version and Release Management
> Version management involves:
> - Deciding on an identification scheme for system versions
> - Ensuring that version management procedures and tools are properly applied
> 
> Release management includes:
> - Planning when new system versions are to be produced
> - Managing the process of creating the release
> - Documenting the release for possible re-creation
> - Distributing new system releases to customers
>
> A consistent scheme of version identification should be established, such as semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). System releases include executable code, data, configuration files, documentation, and often an installation program or script.

> [!idea] Configuration Management Planning
> The configuration management plan describes the standards and procedures that should be used for managing the software process products, including:
> - Requirement specifications
> - Design documents
> - Source code
> - Executable programs
> - Test data
> - User manuals
>
> A document naming scheme should be defined so that related documents have related names, and documents should be managed in a central repository.

> [!consider] System Building and Tools
> System building is the process of compiling and linking software components into an executable system. Different systems are built from different combinations of components. This process is typically supported by automated tools that are driven by 'build scripts' (e.g., make, Ant, Maven, Gradle).
>
> Software tools are available to support all configuration management activities, including version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN), issue tracking systems, and build automation tools.
