> [!consider] Acceptance Criteria
> Effectively managing user story completion is crucial for maintaining project momentum and ensuring delivered features meet stakeholder expectations. Here are key considerations:
> 
> 1. **Acceptance Criteria**:
>    - Developed collaboratively by the Product Owner and development team
>    - Should be clear, concise, and testable
>    - Can be written in plain English or as automated tests (or both)
>    - Example: "User can select up to 5 photos, system validates file types (jpg, png, gif) and total size (â‰¤50MB)"
> 
> 2. **Definition of Done**:
>    - A shared understanding of what it means for a user story to be complete
>    - May include: code written, tests passed, documentation updated, code reviewed
> 
> 3. **Story Points**:
>    - Used to estimate the effort required to complete a story
>    - Helps in sprint planning and tracking progress
> 
> 4. **Task Breakdown**:
>    - Divide user stories into smaller, manageable tasks
>    - Helps track progress within the sprint
> 
> 5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
>    - Automate testing and deployment to catch issues early
> 
> 6. **Regular Check-ins**:
>    - Use daily stand-ups to discuss progress and obstacles
> 
> 7. **Sprint Review**:
>    - Demonstrate completed stories to stakeholders
>    - Gather feedback for potential refinements
> 
> 8. **Backlog Grooming**:
>    - Regularly refine and reprioritize stories based on new information
> 
> Remember: A user story is only complete when it meets all acceptance criteria and the team's definition of done. This ensures that the delivered feature truly meets the user's needs and maintains high quality standards

> [!idea] Definition of Done (DoD)
> The Definition of Done is a **shared understanding among the Scrum Team of what it means for work to be complete**. It ensures quality and provides a clear finish line for Sprint work.
>
> Key aspects of a good Definition of Done:
>
> 1. **Clarity**: Unambiguous and understood by all team members
> 2. **Consistency**: Applied to all user stories or backlog items
> 3. **Verifiability**: Can be checked objectively
> 4. **Completeness**: Covers all aspects necessary for a releasable increment
>
> Common elements in a Definition of Done:
> - Code written and peer-reviewed
> - Unit tests written and passing
> - Integration tests passing
> - Documentation updated
> - Code merged into the main branch
> - Acceptance criteria met
> - Product Owner approval obtained
> - Performance and security checks completed
> - No known defects that violate the release policy
>
> Benefits of a well-defined DoD:
> - Ensures consistent quality across all work
> - Reduces rework and technical debt
> - Improves transparency and predictability
> - Aligns team expectations
> - Facilitates smoother Sprint Reviews and releases
>
> The Definition of Done should be reviewed and updated regularly, often during Sprint Retrospectives, to reflect the team's growing capabilities and changing project needs.
>
> Remember: The DoD is distinct from acceptance criteria. While acceptance criteria are specific to individual user stories, the DoD applies to all work completed by the team.
