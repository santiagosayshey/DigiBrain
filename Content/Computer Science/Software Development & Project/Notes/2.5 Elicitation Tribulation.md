> [!consider] Challenges in Requirements Elicitation
> Eliciting requirements can be challenging due to:
> 
> - Communication gap: **Technical requirements from non-technical stakeholders**
>   - People may struggle to express ideas clearly
>   - Requires asking probing questions to clarify needs
> - Uncertainty: **Stakeholders may not know exactly what they want**
> - Technological constraints: **Desired features may be technically infeasible**
> - Changing needs: **Requirements may evolve during the project**
> 
> Activities to mitigate challenges:
> 1. Collaborate with stakeholders to determine requirements
> 2. Organize requirements into logical groups
> 3. Negotiate and prioritize requirements
> 4. Document requirements clearly
> 
> Effective elicitation requires patience, clear communication, and iterative refinement.

> [!idea] Requirements Elicitation Methods Comparison
> 
> | Method | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |
> |--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
> | Interviews | Direct discussions with stakeholders, either unstructured (open-ended) or structured (predefined questions) | - Provides high-level understanding of needs<br>- Allows for spontaneous exploration of ideas<br>- Flexible and adaptable to stakeholder responses | - Time-consuming<br>- May be influenced by interviewer bias<br>- Requires skilled interviewer to be effective |
> | Use Cases | Scenario-based technique describing user interactions with the system | - Visualizes system behavior from user perspective<br>- Identifies different user roles and their needs<br>- Helps developers relate to user requirements | - Less effective for non-functional requirements<br>- Can be overly detailed for high-level planning<br>- May miss edge cases or exceptional flows |
> | Prototyping | Creating an early model of the system (functional, paper mock-up, or "Wizard of Oz") | - Allows stakeholders to experiment with system concept<br>- Validates interface requirements effectively<br>- Identifies misunderstandings early | - Can be time-consuming to create<br>- May set unrealistic expectations if too polished<br>- Risk of focusing too much on UI rather than functionality |
> 
> Key Considerations:
> - Choose methods based on project context and stakeholder characteristics
> - Often most effective when used in combination
> - Iterate and refine requirements throughout the elicitation process
