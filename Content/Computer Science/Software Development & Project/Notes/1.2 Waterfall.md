> [!idea] Linear Development (Waterfall Model)
> A sequential approach to software development, where **progress flows steadily through distinct phases** without overlap.
> 
>![[Waterfall Model 1.png|500]]
> 
> - Example: Developing software for a heart surgery robot
>   - Requirements fully defined before design begins
>   - Rigorous testing before deployment
>   - Minimal changes after implementation
> - Resembles a waterfall cascading from one stage to the next
> - Key memory aid: 
>   - Lots of work at the top (extensive upfront planning)
>   - Once flowing, it easily progresses downward (because gravity!)
>   - Difficult to go back upstream (challenging to make changes)
>   - Like eating all your vegetables first at dinner:
>     - Challenging at first, but smooth sailing after
> 
> Strengths:
> - Clear structure and milestones
> - Comprehensive documentation
> - Easier to estimate costs and timelines
> - Suits projects with fixed requirements
> 
> Weaknesses:
> - Inflexible to changes
> - Late testing may uncover major issues
> - Customer sees product only at the end
> - Risk of delivering outdated product
