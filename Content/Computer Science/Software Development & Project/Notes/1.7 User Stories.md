> [!idea] User Stories in Agile Development
> User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
> 
> `As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]`.
> 
> Key aspects of user stories:
> 
> 1. **Focus on the user**: Emphasizes the person who will benefit from the feature.
> 2. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and communicate.
> 3. **Flexibility**: Can be easily modified as more is learned.
> 4. **Value-oriented**: Clearly states the benefit to the user.
> 
> Components of a good user story (INVEST):
> - **I**ndependent: Can be developed separately from other stories.
> - **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed and refined.
> - **V**aluable: Provides value to the end user.
> - **E**stimable: Can be sized relative to other stories.
> - **S**mall: Can be completed in one sprint.
> - **T**estable: Clear criteria for acceptance.

> [!example] User Story: Online Shopping Cart Checkout
> 
> User Story:
> As an **online shopping customer**,
> I want a way to **collect items I want to buy all at once**,
> So that I only have to complete **one transaction**.
> 
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> 
> 1. Checking Out:
>    - Given: A customer has added multiple items to the shopping cart
>    - When: They click the check-out button on the user interface
>    - Then: They are asked to complete the transaction for all the items in the cart together
> 
> 2. Checking Out Nothing:
>    - Given: A customer has not added any items to their shopping cart
>    - When: They click the check-out button on the user interface
>    - Then: An error message is displayed notifying them there is nothing in the cart
> 
> **Additional Considerations:**
> - The user interface should clearly display the number of items in the cart
> - The check-out process should show a summary of all items before final purchase
> - The system should handle various payment methods for the single transaction
> - Consider implementing a "save for later" feature for items not ready for immediate purchase
> 
> This user story focuses on improving the customer's shopping experience by allowing them to complete multiple purchases in a single transaction, while also handling the edge case of an empty cart.

> [!example] Evolution of a User Story in Scrum
> This example demonstrates how a user story might evolve throughout the development process, including adaptations to setbacks and changes in product direction.

> | Stage | User Story | Notes |
> |-------|------------|-------|
> | Initial Creation | As a social media user, I want to upload multiple photos at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Product Owner creates the initial story based on user feedback. |
> | Sprint Planning | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 10 photos at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Team refines the story, adding a specific number for the first iteration. |
> | Development | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 10 photos (jpg, png) at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Developers add file type specifications during implementation. |
> | Setback | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos (jpg, png, gif) at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Performance issues discovered; team reduces photo limit but adds gif support. |
> | Sprint Review | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos (jpg, png, gif) at once, with a total size limit of 20MB, so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Stakeholders request a size limit during the review. |
> | Product Owner Change | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos or 1 short video (up to 30 seconds) at once, with a total size limit of 50MB, so that I can share my experiences more dynamically. | New Product Owner pivots to include video sharing capability. |
> | Final Implementation | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos (jpg, png, gif) or 1 short video (up to 30 seconds, mp4 format) at once, with a total size limit of 50MB, so that I can share my experiences more dynamically. | Final version of the user story after development and testing. |
> 
> This example illustrates how a user story can evolve to accommodate technical constraints, setbacks, and changing product direction while maintaining its core value proposition.
