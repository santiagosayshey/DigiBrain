> [!exercise]+ Exercise - Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities with `%n`
> **Example Scenario:**
>
> A vulnerable C program uses `printf` to output a buffer (`buff`) filled with user-controlled input. An attacker crafts an input that includes:
> 1. A recognizable marker (e.g., `"AAAA"`).
> 2. The little-endian representation of a target memory address.
> 3. Multiple `%08x` specifiers to dump stack values or navigate through the stack.
> 4. The `%n` specifier to write the number of characters printed so far to the targeted address.
>
> **Example Input:** 
> ```shell
> "AAAA" + "\xdc\xce\xff\xff" + "%08x."*7 + "%n"
> ```
> This input is designed to:
> - Print initial characters ("AAAA").
> - Place a target address in the buffer, which gets pushed onto the stack.
> - Use `%08x` specifiers to advance through the stack, manipulating the internal state of `printf`.
> - Use `%n` at a strategic point to write into the memory address specified earlier in the payload, modifying the value of a variable (like a flag).
>
> **Why It's Effective:**
> - The `%08x` specifiers consume stack entries, allowing the attacker to "navigate" through the stack to the desired write location.
> - The `%n` specifier writes the count of printed characters to the target address, effectively allowing arbitrary memory modification.
