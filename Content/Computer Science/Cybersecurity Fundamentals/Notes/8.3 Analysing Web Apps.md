> [!idea] Developer Tools (Chrome, Firefox)
>
> Developer tools allow web developers to inspect and debug web pages. These tools allow developers to view and manipulate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a page in real time. They also provide network analysis features that can help diagnose issues with resource loading and HTTP request timings.

> [!example] Using Chrome Developer Tools
>
> To open Chrome Developer Tools, press F12 or right-click on a webpage and select "Inspect". This brings up the Developer Tools window, where you can:
> - **Inspect elements**: Hover over and select any element on a webpage to see its HTML/CSS details.
> - **Console**: View JavaScript logs and interact with the webpage using JavaScript.
> - **Network**: Monitor all network requests made by the page, including details like status codes, headers, and response bodies.
> - **Performance**: Analyze the time it takes for various components of the page to load and render.

> [!idea] Local Proxy Tools
>
> Tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Fiddler act as local proxies and are invaluable for more in-depth web application analysis. They can intercept, inspect, and modify the HTTP requests and responses between your browser and the servers. This ability is crucial for security testing, such as identifying vulnerabilities or testing inputs that the client-side controls might otherwise restrict.

> [!example] Setting up and using Burp Proxy
>
> Burp Proxy allows you to monitor and manipulate network traffic associated with HTTP/HTTPS requests. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:
> 1. **Download and install Burp Suite** from PortSwigger's official website.
> 2. **Configure your browser** to use Burp as its proxy server (usually localhost on port 8080).
> 3. **Navigate to any web page** to see the traffic captured by Burp in the "Proxy" tab.
> 4. **Intercept requests**: Toggle the intercept feature to modify requests before they are sent to the server or responses before they reach the browser.

> [!idea] Proxy Functions in Security
>
> - **Capture and modify traffic (Proxy)**: Analyze or alter the traffic as it passes through.
> - **Repeat requests (Repeater)**: Test how the application behaves under repeated requests or slight modifications.
> - **Automated testing (Intruder, Scanner)**: Systematically test defenses using predetermined attacks or discover vulnerabilities.
> - **Discover content (Spider, Audit)**: Automatically navigate through the web application to map out the structure and discover hidden resources.
