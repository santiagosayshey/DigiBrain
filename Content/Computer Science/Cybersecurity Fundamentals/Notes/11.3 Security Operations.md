> [!example] Case Study: Phishing Attack Incident
> 
> **Context**: A mid-sized financial firm experiences a phishing attack where several employees receive emails that appear to be from the IT department, requesting login credentials for a system update.
> 
> **Assess**:
> - The security team evaluates the firm's security posture, identifying a lack of employee training on phishing threats as a vulnerability. They assess the potential impact of compromised credentials on sensitive financial data.
> 
> **Intelligence**:
> - The team collects data on the phishing emails, including sender addresses, email content, and any associated IP addresses. They analyze this data to determine the origin of the attack and identify patterns.
> 
> **Threat Hunting**:
> - Security analysts proactively search through network logs and employee workstations for indicators of compromise, such as unusual login attempts and connections to suspicious IP addresses. They look for signs that the phishing attack may have been part of a broader campaign.
> 
> **Detect**:
> - The monitoring systems detect for IoCs (indicators of compromise). e.g.. Abnormal login patterns and multiple failed login attempts from unusual locations. Alerts are generated for further investigation.
> 
> **Respond**:
> - The security team quickly resets passwords for affected accounts and implements multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent further unauthorized access. They also isolate compromised systems from the network and conduct a forensic analysis to determine the extent of the breach.
> 
> **Recover**:
> - Normal operations are restored by securely reconfiguring compromised systems and updating security policies. The firm conducts a post-incident review and improves its security posture by enhancing employee training on recognizing phishing attempts and implementing more robust email filtering solutions.
