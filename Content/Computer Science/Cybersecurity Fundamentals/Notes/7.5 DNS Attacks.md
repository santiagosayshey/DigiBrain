> [!idea]+ DNS Poisoning (dnsspoof)
>
> DNS poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the Domain Name System (DNS) to divert traffic away from legitimate servers and towards fake ones controlled by the attacker.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Attacker sends a DNS query to a recursive DNS resolver, asking for the IP address of a domain they wish to spoof.
> 2. Before the real DNS response arrives from a recursive DNS resolver, the attacker sends a forged response with a matching DNS query ID, changing the IP match of the domain to whatever the attacker chooses.
> 3. The recursive resolver caches the spoofed DNS record and serves it to clients, redirecting their traffic to the attacker's server.
>
> **Impact:**
> - Users are directed to fake websites that can steal sensitive information or distribute malware.
> - Attackers can intercept and manipulate network traffic, compromising data integrity and confidentiality.
>
> **Mitigation:**
> - Implement DNSSEC (covered in the next section) to authenticate DNS responses.
> - Use techniques like DNS cache locking and randomizing source ports to make spoofing harder.
> - Keep DNS server software up to date and properly configured to minimize vulnerabilities.



> [!consider]+ DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
>
> DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to the DNS protocol that provides authentication and integrity to DNS responses, helping to prevent attacks like DNS poisoning.
>
> **Key features:**
> - Digitally signs DNS records, allowing recipients to verify their authenticity and integrity.
> - Establishes a chain of trust from the root DNS servers down to individual domains.
> - Recursive resolvers can validate the signatures and ensure the responses have not been tampered with.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Authoritative DNS servers sign their zone records with a private key.
> 2. Public keys for each zone are published in the DNS hierarchy as DNSKEY records.
> 3. When a recursive resolver queries a DNSSEC-enabled domain, it receives the signed DNS response along with the RRSIG (Resource Record Signature).
> 4. The resolver uses the public key to verify the RRSIG and authenticate the response.
>
> **Example:**
> Let's consider the domain `example.com` which is DNSSEC-enabled.
> 1. The authoritative DNS server for `example.com` signs its zone records (A, MX, CNAME, etc.) using its private key.
> 2. The public key for `example.com` is published in the DNS as a DNSKEY record.
> 3. When a recursive resolver, such as `8.8.8.8`, queries for `www.example.com`, it receives the following response:
>    ```
>    www.example.com.  IN  A  192.0.2.1
>    www.example.com.  IN  RRSIG  A 5 3 3600 20220101000000 20210101000000 12345 example.com. <signature\>
>    ```
> 4. The resolver retrieves the DNSKEY record for `example.com` from the DNS hierarchy:
>    ```
>    example.com.  IN  DNSKEY  257 3 5 <public_key>
>    ```
> 5. Using the public key, the resolver verifies the RRSIG signature for the A record of `www.example.com`.
> 6. If the signature is valid, the resolver can trust that the DNS response is authentic and has not been tampered with.
> 7. The resolver caches the authenticated DNS record and returns the result to the client.
>
> In this example, DNSSEC ensures that the IP address returned for `www.example.com` is indeed the authentic one published by the domain owner. An attacker attempting to spoof the DNS response would not be able to generate a valid RRSIG signature without access to the domain's private key.
>
> **Deployment considerations:**
> - DNSSEC requires support from both authoritative DNS servers and recursive resolvers.
> - Key management is critical, as the security of DNSSEC relies on the protection of private keys.
> - Proper validation of the DNSSEC chain of trust is essential to prevent attacks.
>
> **Limitations:**
> - DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality for DNS queries and responses.
> - It does not protect against attacks that do not involve modifying DNS data, such as DDoS attacks.
