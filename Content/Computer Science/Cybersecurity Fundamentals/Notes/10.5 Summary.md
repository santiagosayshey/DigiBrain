> - **DFIR**: Digital forensics and incident response involve identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence while managing the aftermath of cyber-attacks.
> - **DFIR Phases**: Identification, preservation, analysis, documentation, and presentation.
> - **DFIR Areas**: Computer forensics, network forensics, mobile device forensics, cloud forensics, and malware forensics.
> - **CIRT**: A Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) is a group of professionals tasked with responding to and managing cybersecurity incidents.
> - **Logs**: Records of activities and events on a system or network, essential for understanding incidents and identifying involved parties.
> - **Forensic Tools**: Tools for file format identification (`file`), file carving (`dd`), searching for plaintext (`strings`) and binary/hex strings (`hexdump`), and extracting metadata (`exiftool`).
> - **Packet Traces**: Capturing and analyzing raw network packets using tools like Wireshark to identify malicious activity.
> - **Network Logs**: Records of activities on network devices like firewalls, routers, and intrusion detection systems, useful for tracing an attacker's actions and timeline.
> - **Steganography**: The practice of concealing secret information within non-secret data, such as in text, images (spatial or frequency domain), or videos.
> - **Steganalysis**: The process of detecting the presence of steganography within files using techniques like statistical analysis, pixel pattern examination, machine learning algorithms, and carrier file analysis.
> - **x86 Architecture**: Specifies how software and hardware interact, determining instruction processing and data management. Important for reverse engineering due to prevalence, documentation, and compatibility.
> - **x86 Registers**: EIP (instruction pointer), ESP (stack pointer), and EBP (base pointer) are crucial for managing execution flow and stack operations.
> - **Reverse Engineering**: The process of analyzing a software system to identify components and interrelationships, creating higher-level representations. Involves disassembly, decompilation, static analysis, and dynamic analysis.
> - **Disassemblers and Decompilers**: Tools for converting machine code into assembly language (disassemblers) or high-level code (decompilers) for analysis and understanding.
> - **Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**: Static analysis examines code without execution, while dynamic analysis observes runtime behavior.
> - **Ghidra**: A powerful open-source reverse engineering tool supporting disassembly, decompilation, and interactive analysis.
