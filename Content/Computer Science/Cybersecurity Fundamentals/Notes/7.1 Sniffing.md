> 
> Sniffing is the process of **capturing and analysing network traffic**. It involves monitoring and recording the data packets that are transmitted over a network. Sniffers, also known as packet analyzers, are tools used to perform sniffing.
> 
> - Sniffing can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network troubleshooting and monitoring, but it can also be used maliciously to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data.
> - In a network, data packets are transmitted in plain text unless encryption is used. Sniffers can capture these unencrypted packets and extract information from them.
> - Sniffing can be performed on both wired and wireless networks.
> 
> **Countermeasures:**
> - **Use encryption**: Encrypt data in transit to prevent unauthorized access to the content of the packets.
> - **Secure network infrastructure**: Employ secure network protocols like HTTPS, and use VPNs to enhance security.
> - **Regular monitoring**: Perform regular network monitoring and audits to detect any unauthorized sniffing activities.


> [!example] Case Study 1: Starbucks Public Wi-Fi Sniffing
>
> In 2019, a security researcher conducted an experiment to demonstrate the risks of using public Wi-Fi networks. He visited a Starbucks coffee shop and used a sniffing tool called Wireshark to capture network traffic on the public Wi-Fi.
>
> The researcher discovered that many customers were using the Wi-Fi network without any encryption, exposing their sensitive information. He was able to capture the following data:
> - Usernames and passwords for various online services
> - Email messages and attachments
> - Social media interactions and private messages
> - Unencrypted HTTP traffic revealing browsing history
>
> The researcher did not use or disclose any of the captured information and reported his findings to raise awareness about the risks of using public Wi-Fi without proper security measures, such as using a VPN or only accessing encrypted websites (HTTPS).


> [!exercise] Understanding Network Traffic Sniffing
>
> This exercise provides a practical perspective on the implications of network sniffing, illustrating how unsecured or inadequately secured network traffic can be intercepted and analyzed.
>
> **Observations**:
> - **Unencrypted ICMP Traffic**:
>   - Observing ICMP packets in Wireshark while the Hacklab VM pings `google.com` reveals how data can be captured on a network. The command used:
>     ```bash
>     ping google.com
>     ```
>   - This example shows the ease of capturing typical network communications like ping requests and responses in a promiscuous network environment.
>
> - **FTP Credentials**:
>   - Attempting an FTP connection to `ftp.adelaide.edu.au` with a fictitious username and password showcases the vulnerability of unencrypted protocols. The credentials are visible in Wireshark, demonstrating the potential for data leakage. Command example:
>     ```bash
>     ftp ftp.adelaide.edu.au
>     Username: exampleuser
>     Password: examplepassword
>     ```
>
> - **Automatic Detection of Plaintext Passwords**:
>   - Using `dsniff` on Kali Linux highlights how effortlessly plaintext passwords transmitted over the network can be intercepted. Installation and usage command:
>     ```bash
>     sudo apt install dsniff
>     sudo dsniff
>     ```
>
> - **Image Capture with Driftnet**:
>   - Browsing an HTTP website and capturing images through `driftnet` underscores the risks associated with unencrypted web traffic. Commands for setting up and running Driftnet:
>     ```bash
>     sudo apt install driftnet
>     sudo driftnet -i eth0
>     ```
>   - Visiting a non-HTTPS site and observing captured images demonstrates how data can be visually extracted from network traffic.
>
> This exercise underscores the necessity of encryption and secure network practices to protect data from being intercepted and misused.
