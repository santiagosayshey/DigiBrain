> **How do we manage and interact with data in systems** where information constantly changes and grows? Consider the tasks involved in updating customer records, processing transactions, or retrieving specific data quickly and securely.

> [!idea] **SQL **
>
> SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a tool that manages data in relational databases. It allows us to **find, update, insert, and delete data efficiently**, meeting the needs of complex data systems.
>
> Below is a table summarizing the primary SQL commands and some advanced operations:
>
> | Command   | Description                                           | Additional Keywords       |
> |-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
> | **SELECT**    | Retrieves data from database tables.                  | WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY |
> | **INSERT**    | Adds new rows of data to tables.                      |                           |
> | **UPDATE**    | Modifies existing data.                               | WHERE, SET                |
> | **DELETE**    | Removes data.                                         | WHERE                     |
> | **JOIN**      | Combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns. | INNER, OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT |
> | **Subqueries**| Executes a query nested within another query.         |                           |
>
> These commands are foundational for interacting with data in relational databases, each equipped with specific keywords that refine and enhance their functionality:
>
> - **WHERE**: Specifies which rows to select, update, or delete, adding precision to operations.
> - **GROUP BY**: Groups similar data together, often used with aggregate functions.
> - **ORDER BY**: Sorts the data returned by a query in ascending or descending order.
> - **SET**: Specifies the columns to update and the new values in an UPDATE command.

> [!example] **Using SQL SELECT Command**
>
> Suppose we have a database with a table named `Customers`. To retrieve a list of all customers:
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM Customers;
> ```
> This command fetches all columns and rows from the `Customers` table.

> [!example] **Using SQL JOIN Command**
>
> Consider two tables, `Orders` and `Customers`, where each order is linked to a customer through a `CustomerID`. To retrieve a list of orders along with the customer names:
> ```sql
> SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
> FROM Orders
> INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
> ```
> | OrderID | CustomerName |
> |---------|--------------|
> | 1       | John Doe     |
> | 2       | Jane Smith   |
> 
> This command shows how an INNER JOIN combines rows from both tables where there is a match in `CustomerID`.

> [!example] **Using SQL UPDATE Command**
>
> To update the address for a customer with ID 1 in the `Customers` table:
> ```sql
> UPDATE Customers
> SET Address = '123 New Address'
> WHERE CustomerID = 1;
> ```
> This command changes the address field for the customer whose ID is 1.


> [!idea] **OWASP and Web Application Security**
>
> The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the security of software. One of their key resources, the **OWASP Top 10, lists the most critical security risks** to web applications. Among these, **SQL injection (SQLi) is a prevalent threat**, where attackers exploit vulnerabilities in SQL database management systems to execute malicious SQL statements.

> [!idea] **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
>
> SQL injection (SQLi) occurs when an attacker manages to insert or **"inject" a malicious SQL query into the input data from** a client to the application. This can happen when applications **unsafely take user input and use it to construct SQL queries**. If an application **fails to properly sanitize input**, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of data, and other malicious activities.

> [!example] *OR '1'='1' Authentication Bypass
>
>  `'OR '1'='1'`  manipulates the logic of SQL queries to grant unauthorized access by appending a condition that is always true.
>
> **How the Exploit Works:**
>
> - **SQL Query Vulnerability**: Consider a SQL query typically used in a login system:
>   ```sql
>   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '[user_input]' AND password = '[user_input]';
>   ```
>   This query checks if the entered username and password match a record in the users table.
>
> - **Exploitation**: An attacker inputs `' OR '1'='1' --` into the username field. Hereâ€™s how this input disrupts the SQL query:
>   ```sql
>   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' --' AND password = 'anything';
>   ```
>   - **`'' OR '1'='1'`**: By inserting this condition, the query's WHERE clause will always evaluate to true because `'1'='1'` is a universally true statement.
>   - **`--`**: This SQL comment syntax effectively ends the query, ignoring any subsequent conditions, including the password check.
>
> **Result of the Exploit**:
> - Since we are selecting everything from the users table in a universally true statement `'OR '1'='1'`, we are outputting the entirety of the table and stealing every username and password.
>


> [!example] Using UNION to Extract Data
>
> The `UNION` SQL operator combines the results from multiple `SELECT` statements into a single result set, which must have the same number of columns and compatible data types. Attackers can misuse `UNION` to append unauthorized queries to a legitimate query, allowing them to extract sensitive data stealthily.
>
> **How the Exploit Works:**
>
> - **Original Query**: Imagine a website uses the following SQL query to display product details from user input:
>   ```sql
>   SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE id = [user_input];
>   ```
> - **Malicious Input**: An attacker modifies the input to:
>   ```sql
>   1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users;
>   ```
>   This input alters the intended query to also fetch usernames and passwords from a users table.
>
> - **Result of the Exploit**:
>   - The database executes the combined query, first attempting to fetch a product with ID `1`, then appending the results from the users table. This allows the attacker to retrieve a list of all usernames and passwords stored in the database, exploiting the `UNION` to gain access to data beyond the intended scope.

> [!example] Batched SQL Statements
>
> SQL environments that support multiple statements separated by semicolons are vulnerable to batched SQL injection. This allows attackers to append destructive SQL commands to benign queries, potentially leading to data loss or other damaging actions.
>
> **How the Exploit Works:**
>
> - **Original Query**: A typical query used to fetch student names might look like this:
>   ```sql
>   SELECT name FROM students WHERE id = [user_input];
>   ```
> - **Malicious Input**: An attacker inputs:
>   ```sql
>   1; DROP TABLE students;
>   ```
>   This input uses a semicolon to end the original query and start a new command that deletes the `students` table.
>
> - **Result of the Exploit**:
>   - The SQL engine executes the first query, returning the name of the student with ID `1`. It then processes the second command, dropping the `students` table, leading to loss of all data in that table and potentially disrupting the application's functionality.


> [!consider] Preventing Common Web Application Attacks
>
> Protecting web applications from SQL injection, command injection, and XSS requires several key strategies:
>
> - **Input Validation**: Check all user inputs to ensure they meet specific criteria before processing.
> - **Parameterized Queries**: Use parameterized queries to separate SQL logic from data, preventing execution of harmful code.
> - **Sanitization**: Remove or neutralize harmful elements from user inputs to prevent script injections.
> - **Use Safe APIs**: Opt for APIs that automatically handle input safely, like PDO for PHP/MySQL.
> - **Least Privilege Principle**: Restrict database access rights to the minimum necessary for application functionality.
> - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define what resources the browser is allowed to load, preventing unauthorized scripts.
> - **Regular Updates and Patching**: Maintain the latest security patches for all software components.
> - **Security Training**: Educate developers about secure coding practices.
>
> Implementing these practices will reduce risks from major vulnerabilities and enhance application security.
