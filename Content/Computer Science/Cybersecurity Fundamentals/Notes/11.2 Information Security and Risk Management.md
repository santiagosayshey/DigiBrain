> [!idea] Information Security Management
> Information security management involves **protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets** by efficiently deploying security controls to prevent and detect threats. The main objectives of information security management are:
> 1. Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure
> 2. Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of information
> 3. Maintaining the accessibility of information for authorized users
> 4. Implementing controls to mitigate risks to information assets
> 5. Continuously monitoring and improving the security posture of the organization

> [!idea] Understanding Information Security Risks
> Information security risks arise from the **combination of threats and vulnerabilities**:
> - A threat is a potential cause of an incident that may result in harm to systems or organizations
> - A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat source
> 
> The level of risk is determined by the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the resulting impact on the organization. Some common examples of information security risks include:
> - Malware infection due to unpatched systems
> - Data breach due to weak access controls
> - System downtime due to DDoS attacks
> - Data loss due to lack of backups
> 
> To effectively manage risks, organizations need to identify, assess, and prioritize them based on their likelihood and potential impact.
> 
> **Likelihood:**
> 
> | Rating | Description | Frequency |
> |--------|-------------|-----------|
> | High   | Expected to occur frequently | > Once per year |
> | Medium | May occur occasionally | Once every 1-3 years |
> | Low    | Unlikely to occur | < Once every 3 years |
>
> **Impact:**
> 
> | Rating | Description | Business Impact |
> |--------|-------------|-----------------|
> | High   | Significant impact on operations or reputation | > $1 million |
> | Medium | Noticeable impact, but limited in scope | $100k - $1 million |
> | Low    | Minimal impact, can be easily absorbed | < $100k |

> [!example] Levels of Risk Against a University
> - **Extreme:** Risks with a very high likelihood and severe impact, requiring immediate attention and mitigation. Examples include:
>   - A major cyber-attack causing significant data loss and operational disruption.
>   - A critical system failure impacting university-wide services during exam periods.
> - **High:** Risks with a high likelihood and significant impact, necessitating prompt action and close monitoring. Examples include:
>   - Frequent phishing attacks leading to compromised sensitive information.
>   - Repeated malware infections affecting multiple departments.
> - **Medium:** Risks with a moderate likelihood and impact, which should be addressed with appropriate controls. Examples include:
>   - Occasional unauthorized access incidents due to weak passwords.
>   - Periodic network outages affecting specific buildings or departments.
> - **Low:** Risks with a low likelihood and minimal impact, which can be managed through routine procedures and accepted if necessary. Examples include:
>   - Rare minor data breaches involving non-sensitive information.
>   - Isolated instances of hardware failure in non-critical systems.

> [!consider] Dealing with Identified Risks
> Once risks are identified and assessed, organizations must **decide how to treat them based on their risk level** and available resources. The four main risk treatment options are:
> 1. Accept: Decide to tolerate the risk without further action
> 2. Transfer: Share the risk with a third party (e.g., insurance)
> 3. Mitigate: **Implement controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk** 
> 4. Avoid: Eliminate the risk by ceasing the associated activity
>
> Mitigation is the most common approach, which involves implementing security controls as countermeasures. Controls can be preventive, detective, or corrective in nature.


> [!idea] Types of Security Controls
> Security controls are measures put in place to mitigate identified risks. They can be categorized as:
> - Administrative: Policies, procedures, guidelines
> - Physical: Locks, surveillance, access barriers
> - Technical: Software and hardware controls
>
> Controls can also be classified by their function:
> - Preventive: Stop threats from materializing (e.g., access control, encryption)
> - Detective: Identify threat occurrences (e.g., intrusion detection, audit logs) 
> - Corrective: Remediate the impact of materialized threats (e.g., incident response, backup restore)
>
> A robust security posture requires a well-balanced mix of control types.


> [!example] Example Risk Analysis
> Consider a web application that stores sensitive customer data. A risk assessment identifies the following risks:
> 
> | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Rating |
> |------|------------|--------|-------------|
> | SQL Injection | High | High | High |
> | DDoS Attack | Medium | Medium | Medium |
> | Data Breach | Medium | High | High |
> 
> Based on this assessment, the organization decides to mitigate these risks by implementing the following controls:
> - Input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
> - Web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block DDoS attacks
> - Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit to reduce breach impact
> 
> After implementing these controls, the risk ratings are re-evaluated and reduced to an acceptable level in alignment with the organization's risk appetite.
