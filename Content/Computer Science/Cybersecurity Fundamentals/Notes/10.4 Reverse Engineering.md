> [!motivation] Need for Reverse Engineering
> 
> Often, we encounter **software or systems without documentation or access to the original source code**. This situation presents several challenges:
> 
> - **Identifying and fixing bugs or vulnerabilities** in the software
> - Integrating the software with other systems or components
> - Assessing the software's security and reliability
> - **Learning from the software's design** and implementation techniques

> [!idea] Reverse Engineering
>
> Reverse engineering is the **process of analysing a software system to identify the system's components** and their interrelationships, **creating representations of the system at a higher level** of abstraction (i.e. binary to source code). This process involves:
> 
> - **Disassembly**: Breaking down compiled executable code into assembly code.
> - **Decompilation**: Transforming machine code back into high-level code.
> - **Static Analysis**: Examining the code without executing it to understand its structure and behavior.
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the code and observing its behavior during execution to understand its functionality.
> 
> Reverse engineering is crucial for understanding undocumented software, integrating systems, and assessing security, but it also has legal and ethical implications.

> [!consider] Legal and Ethical Aspects
> 
> Reverse engineering involves several legal and ethical considerations. It can be used for legitimate purposes, such as:
> 
> - **Security analysis**: Finding and fixing vulnerabilities
> - **Interoperability**: Ensuring compatibility between different systems
> - **Research and learning**: Understanding software design and implementation
> 
> However, it can also be used maliciously:
> 
> - **Software piracy**: Creating unauthorized copies of software
> - **Exploiting vulnerabilities**: Finding and using flaws for malicious purposes
> - **Intellectual property theft**: Stealing proprietary algorithms and techniques

> [!idea] Disassemblers and Decompilers
>
> Disassemblers and decompilers are tools for **reverse engineering software without source cod**e.
>
> **Disassemblers**:
> - **Function**: **Convert machine code (binary) into assembly language**, allowing for low-level analysis of the program's instructions.
> - **Usage**: Useful for understanding how a program operates at the instruction level and for identifying specific functions and control flows.
>
> **Decompilers**:
> - **Function**: **Transform machine code into high-level code**, such as C or C++, providing a more abstract and human-readable view of the software.
> - **Usage**: Useful for getting an overview of the software's logic and for identifying higher-level constructs and algorithms.

> [!example] Example: OpenGoal Project for Jak and Daxter Games
>
> The OpenGoal project is an excellent example of reverse engineering without source code. The project aims to decompile the Jak and Daxter games, converting their binary code back into a readable and modifiable form.
>
> **Process**:
> - **Disassembly**: The project begins by disassembling the game's binary files to understand the low-level instructions and control flow.
> - **Decompilation**: The next step involves using a decompiler to convert these instructions into high-level code, making it easier to analyze and modify.
> - **Reconstruction**: The decompiled code is then reconstructed and refined to match the original game's logic and functionality.
>
> **Benefits**:
> - **Preservation**: Helps preserve classic games by making them accessible and modifiable.
> - **Learning**: Provides insights into game design and programming techniques used in the original games.
> - **Modding**: Allows the community to create mods and improvements for the game.

> [!consider] Static vs. Dynamic Analysis
> 
> - **Static Analysis**: Involves examining the code without executing it, useful for understanding structure and detecting potential vulnerabilities.
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Involves executing the code and observing its behavior, useful for understanding runtime behavior and identifying hidden issues.

> [!example] Example: Static vs. Dynamic Analysis
> 
> **Static Analysis Example**:
> 
> Imagine you have a disassembled binary file of a program. By examining the assembly code, you notice a potential buffer overflow vulnerability:
> 
> ```assembly
> mov eax, [esp+4]    ; Move the first function argument into eax
> lea ecx, [esp+8]    ; Load the address of the buffer into ecx
> mov edx, eax        ; Copy the length into edx
> rep movsb           ; Copy bytes from the source to the buffer
> ```
> 
> By analyzing the instructions, you can see that the program copies data into a buffer without checking its size, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input is larger than the buffer.
> 
> **Dynamic Analysis Example**:
> 
> To further investigate, you run the program in a controlled environment using a debugger. You provide an input that exceeds the buffer size to observe the program's behavior:
> 
> ```bash
> $ gdb ./vulnerable_program
> (gdb) run < large_input.txt
> ```
> 
> While running the program, you monitor the memory and register values. You notice that the program crashes when the input exceeds the buffer size, confirming the presence of a buffer overflow vulnerability.

> [!idea] Tools for Reverse Engineering
> 
> **Ghidra**: A powerful open-source reverse engineering tool developed by the NSA, which supports:
> 
> - **Disassembly**: Converts machine code to assembly language.
> - **Decompilation**: Transforms machine code back into high-level code.
> - **Interactive GUI**: Allows for detailed analysis and manipulation of code.

> [!example] Example: Using Ghidra for Reverse Engineering
> 
> **Scenario**: You have a binary file of a software application, and you need to understand its functionality and identify potential vulnerabilities. 
> 
> **Steps**:
> 
> 1. **Load the Binary**:
>    - Open Ghidra and create a new project.
>    - Import the binary file into the project.
>    - Ghidra will analyze the binary, disassembling it into assembly code.
> 
> 2. **Disassembly**:
>    - Navigate through the disassembled code to identify functions and code segments.
>    - Example: Finding a function that handles user input.
>    ```assembly
>    00401000 <handle_input>:
>    00401000: push ebp
>    00401001: mov ebp, esp
>    00401003: sub esp, 0x20
>    00401006: mov eax, [ebp+0x8]
>    ...
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Decompilation**:
>    - Use Ghidra’s decompiler to convert assembly code into a high-level representation.
>    - Example: Viewing the decompiled function in C-like pseudocode.
>    ```c
>    void handle_input(char *input) {
>        char buffer[32];
>        strcpy(buffer, input);
>        ...
>    }
>    ```
>    - This helps in understanding the logic and identifying potential vulnerabilities, like buffer overflows.
> 
> 4. **Interactive Analysis**:
>    - Use Ghidra’s interactive GUI to set breakpoints, add comments, and explore code paths.
>    - Example: Setting a breakpoint at the `strcpy` function to monitor its behavior during execution.
> 
> 5. **Vulnerability Identification**:
>    - Analyze the decompiled code to spot vulnerabilities.
>    - In this example, the use of `strcpy` without proper bounds checking suggests a buffer overflow vulnerability.
> 
> **Conclusion**:
> 
> By using Ghidra, you can convert binary files into readable and analyzable code, facilitating the identification of vulnerabilities and understanding of software functionality.
