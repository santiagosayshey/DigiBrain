> [!idea]+ Penetration Testing
> An authorised simulated cyberattack on a computer system performed to evaluate the security of the system. We can break this down into 5 major steps: 
> - **Planning / Pre-Engagement** - Understanding and agreeing to:
> 	- Scope and Goals
> 	- Constraints
> 	- Timeframe
> 	- Communication Procedures
> 	- Methodologies and Tools
> 	- Sign Engagement letter
> - **Reconnaissance / Intelligence Gathering / Foot Printing**
> 	- Google Dorks
> 	- Whois / DNS
> 	- Social Media
> 	- Shodan / Censys / Netcraft
> 	- Kali Tools
> - **Scanning / Vulnerability Analysis**
> 	- Active enumeration of hosts and assets
> 	- Ping sweep
> 	- Port scanning
> 	- OS Fingerprinting
> 	- Service identification (banner grabbing)
> 	- *Identification of vulnerabilities*
> 	- ExploitDB (known vulnerabilities)
> 	- OpenVAS, Nessus, Nexpose
> - **Exploitation**
> 	- Exploit vulnerabilities
> 	- Automated
> 	- Metasploit
> 	- SQLMap
> 	- Exploit DB
> 	- POC codes
> 	- Manual exploitation
> 	- Social Engineering / Physical
> - **Reporting**
> 	- Rating risks based on impact and ease of attack
> 	- Remediation recommendations
> 	- Context is important@
> 	- What data is leaked? Is it sensitive info?
> 	- Do you need to be inside the network?
> 	- Do you need to be authenticated?
> 


> [!idea]+ Vulnerability Assessment
> Looking for known security issues by using automated tools to match conditions with known vulnerabilities.
> - Software bug (Buffer overflow, Input validation failures, Authorisation breakdown)
> - Misconfiguration (Default and weak passwords)
> - Weak protocols
>   
> Automated VA is good for a broad initial sweep, but produces a lot of false positives and negatives.

> - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

> [!idea]+ Other Assessments
> **Red, Blue & Purple Teaming**
>-  A variant of open ended penetration testing. Focuses on testing blue team capabilities (detection and response). Purple team allows real time communication between red and blue.

> **Baseline Configuration Review**
> - Checking configuration of systems against 'best practice'
> - MBSA (Microsoft Baseline Security Analyser)
> - CIS (Centre for Internet security)
> 
> **Code Reviews**
> - Use of manual and automated tools to review security of source code
> - Automated tools include:
> 	- Bandit
> 	- Breakman
> 	- Veracode
> 	  
> **Software Testing Limitations**
> - Testing is strictly negative assurance
> 	- Tester can only say that issues were found, but cannot guarantee that no other issues exist
> 	- Be aware of testers or testing report that confidently states "Thorough testing was done and no issues were found" - There will **ALWAYS** be issues.
> 
> **Management and Control Auditing**
> - User account management (pro/de-provisioning)
> - Segregation of duties
> - Change management process
> - Information security management and KPI reviews
> - Compliance against policies, laws and regulations
> - Auditing
> - Disaster recovery and business continuity planning
