> [!idea] Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
> 
> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that **arises when a web application accepts user-supplied input and uses it to make requests to other systems** or resources on the server-side, without sufficient validation or sanitization. The attacker can manipulate these requests to access internal resources, bypass security controls, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the server.
> 
> In an SSRF attack, the **attacker crafts a malicious request that tricks the server into making an unintended request** to a target system. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's input handling, such as inadequate input validation or improper trust in user-supplied data.

> [!example] SSRF in Action: Exploiting a Vulnerable Weather API
>
> Suppose there's a web application that provides weather information based on user-supplied location data. The application uses an internal API to fetch weather data from a third-party service. However, the application doesn't properly validate the user input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the API request.
>
> Here's how an attacker could exploit this SSRF vulnerability:
>
> 1. Identify the vulnerable endpoint that accepts user-supplied location data.
>
> 2. Craft a malicious URL pointing to an internal resource, e.g., `http://localhost/admin`.
>
> 3. Send the malicious URL as the location input to the vulnerable endpoint.
>
> 4. The application server receives the malicious URL and makes a request to the specified internal resource instead of the intended weather API.
>
> 5. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the internal resource, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing malicious actions.

> [!consider] SSRF vs. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
> 
> | Aspect | SSRF | CSRF |
> |--------|------|------|
> | Target | Server-side resources and systems | User's session and actions |
> | Exploited Trust | Server's trust in user-supplied input | User's trust in authenticated session |
> | Impact | Unauthorized access to internal resources, data exfiltration, command execution | Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying account settings or performing transactions |

> [!consider] Preventing Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
>
> To mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities, consider the following measures:
>
> Network Layer:
> - Segment remote resource access functionality in **separate networks to reduce the impact of SSRF**.
> - Enforce **"deny by default"** firewall policies or network access control rules to block all but essential intranet traffic.
>
> Application Layer:
> - **Sanitize and validate** all client-supplied input data.
> - **Enforce the URL schema**, port, and destination with a positive allow list.
> - **Do not send raw** responses to clients.
> - Disable HTTP **redirection**.
