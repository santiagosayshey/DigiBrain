> [!idea] DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
>
> DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices when they connect to a network.
>
> How DHCP works:
> 1. Client Discover: The client broadcasts a request for a configuration.
> 2. DHCP Offer: Any DHCP server can respond with a configuration offer, which includes:
>    - An IP address for the client
>    - The DNS server's IP address
>    - The (gateway) router's IP address
>    - An expiration time for the configuration
> 3. Client Request: The client broadcasts which configuration it has chosen.
> 4. DHCP Acknowledgement: The chosen server confirms that its configuration has been given to the client.
>
> Initial network configuration:
> - To connect to a network, a user needs:
>   - An IP address
>   - The IP address of the DNS server
>   - The IP address of the router (gateway)
> - The first time a user connects, they don't have this information yet and don't know who to ask for it.
> - DHCP gives the user a configuration when they first join the network.
>
> DHCP attacks and defence:
> - Attacks on DHCP are similar to ARP spoofing:
>   - Spoofing: The attacker claims to have an answer.
>   - Race condition: The requester accepts the first response, so the attacker's response must arrive first.
> - Main vulnerabilities:
>   - Broadcast protocols: Requests are sent to everyone on the LAN, so the attacker can see every request.
>   - No trust anchor: There is no way to verify that responses are legitimate.
>
> DHCP simplifies network configuration by automatically providing devices with the necessary network settings, but it also has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers if proper security measures are not in place.
