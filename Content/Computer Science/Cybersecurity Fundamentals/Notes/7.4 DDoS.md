> [!idea]+ Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks
>
> A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to **disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted system** by overwhelming it with a **flood of Internet traffic** from multiple sources.
>
> **Botnets:**
> - Networks of compromised computers controlled by an attacker
> - Computers are infected with malware, allowing the attacker to control them remotely
> - Attacker commands the botnet to generate the DDoS traffic targeting the victim
>
> **Motivation behind DDoS Attacks:**
> - Extortion: Attackers demand payment to stop the attack
> - Hacktivism: Attacks motivated by political or ideological goals
> - Competition: Businesses attacking competitors to gain an advantage
> - Cyber Warfare: Nation-states using DDoS as part of their offensive cyber capabilities
>
> **Impact of DDoS Attacks:**
> - Downtime and unavailability of targeted services
> - Financial losses due to lost productivity and sales
> - Reputational damage and loss of customer trust
> - Increased operational costs for mitigation and recovery
>
> **DDoS Mitigation Strategies:**
> - Over-provisioning bandwidth to absorb traffic spikes
> - Using DDoS mitigation services to filter and scrub malicious traffic
> - Implementing intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and firewalls to detect and block attacks
> - Developing incident response plans to minimize the impact of successful attacks

> [!example]+ Amplified Denial-of-Service Attacks
>
> Amplified Denial-of-Service attacks are a type of DDoS attack that **exploit the characteristics of certain protocols** to **amplify the attacker's traffic**, increasing its impact on the target.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Attacker sends requests to public servers with the source IP spoofed to the target's address
> 2. Servers respond to the spoofed IP (target) with a much larger response than the initial request
> 3. Target is overwhelmed by a high volume of unsolicited traffic
>
> **Common Amplification Vectors:**
> - DNS Amplification: Exploits the large size of DNS responses compared to requests
> - NTP Amplification: Abuses the monlist feature of NTP servers to generate large responses
> - SSDP Amplification: Uses the discovery feature of UPnP devices to elicit large responses
> - Memcached Amplification: Leverages the high bandwidth of memcached servers to amplify attacks
>
> **Mitigation:**
> - Disable unnecessary services and features on public-facing servers
> - Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering on network devices
> - Use anti-spoofing techniques like ingress filtering and Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)
> - Collaborate with ISPs to identify and block spoofed traffic close to the source

> [!example]+ TCP Reset (RST) Injection 
>
> TCP Reset injection is an attack where a malicious actor injects forged TCP Reset packets into an established connection to abruptly terminate it.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Attacker sniffs network traffic to identify active TCP connections and their sequence numbers
> 2. Attacker crafts a forged TCP packet with the RST flag set and a sequence number within the valid window 
> 3. Forged RST packet is sent to one or both endpoints, causing them to immediately terminate the connection
> 
> **Impact:**
> - Abrupt termination of TCP connections disrupts service availability
> - Can be used to interrupt transmissions at sensitive times, e.g. cutting off a large file download right before completion
>
> **Mitigations:**  
> - Implement encrypted protocols like SSL/TLS to prevent sniffing sequence numbers
> - Use TCP MD5 signature option to authenticate packets
> - Filter out external traffic with RST flag set at network perimeter

> [!example]+ SYN Flooding DoS Attack
>
> SYN flooding is a denial-of-service attack that exploits the [[7.2 Three Way Connection|TCP 3-Way Handshake]] process to overwhelm a target with half-open connections, exhausting its resources.
>
> **Attack Process:**
> 1. Attacker sends a flood of SYN packets to the target server, often with spoofed source IP addresses
> 2. Server responds to each SYN with a SYN-ACK, allocating resources to hold the half-open connection 
> 3. Attacker never sends the final ACK, causing the server to maintain many half-open connections
> 4. As more malicious SYN requests are received, the server's connection queue fills up and it can no longer accept legitimate connections
>
> **Impact:**
> - Target system becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion 
> - Legitimate users are denied service as the server cannot process their connection requests
>
> **Mitigation Techniques:**
> - Implement SYN cookies to avoid storing connection state for half-open connections
> - Configure firewalls to limit the number of SYN packets from a single source
> - Enable TCP half-open connection logging and alerting to detect SYN flooding attempts
> - Scale up infrastructure to increase capacity to handle large SYN floods
