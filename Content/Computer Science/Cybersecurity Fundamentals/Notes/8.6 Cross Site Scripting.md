>
> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when an attacker **injects malicious scripts into content from a trusted website**. This script is then executed by the browser of anyone who views the compromised content, potentially leading to stolen cookies, sessions, or other sensitive information managed by the browser.

> [!example] *Example of XSS Attack*
>
> **Scenario**: A blog application allows users to post comments that are displayed to other users without sufficient input sanitation.
>
> **Vulnerable HTML/JavaScript Code**:
> ```html
> <div>
>   User Comment: <script>document.write("This is user-generated content.");</script>
> </div>
> ```
> **Exploitation**:
> - An attacker posts a comment containing a script: `<script>fetch('/steal-cookie').then(data => document.cookie)</script>`
> - The script attempts to steal cookies from anyone viewing the comment and send them to the attackerâ€™s server.
>
> **Result of the Exploit**:
> - When other users view the comment, the malicious script runs in their browsers, potentially sending their cookies to the attacker, compromising their sessions and personal data.
