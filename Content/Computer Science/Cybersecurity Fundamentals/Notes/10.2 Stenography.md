> 
> **Definition**: Steganography is the practice of c**oncealing secret information within non-secret data**.
> 
> **In Text**: Hidden messages can be embedded in text by manipulating fonts, spacing, or using invisible characters.
> 
> **In Images**: Information can be hidden within images by:
> - **Spatial Domain**: Modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel values or using color separation. This method is known as LSB image steganography.
> - **Frequency Domain**: Applying transforms such as FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) or DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) to embed signals in select frequency bands. This involves altering the least perceptible bits to avoid detection. However, these bits are also targeted by lossy image compression software like JPEG.

> [!idea] Steganalysis
> 
> **Definition**: Steganalysis is the process of detecting the presence of steganography within files.
> 
> **Techniques**: 
> - **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzing file size, statistics, and other measurable attributes to detect anomalies indicative of hidden data.
> - **Pixel Pattern Examination**: Detecting unusual pixel patterns in images that may suggest hidden information.
> - **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Using advanced algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies that are difficult to detect with traditional methods.
> 
> **Carrier File Analysis**: Involves comparing the suspected file with an original, unaltered version to identify changes such as color variations, resolution loss, or other distortions. This method is effective when the original file is known, allowing for direct comparison.


> [!example] Example: Video Steganography to Catch Pirates
> 
> **Illustrative Example**: Movie studios embed unique canaries within video files to identify the source of leaks. These canaries can be **slight alterations in frame data or watermarks that are invisible** to viewers but detectable through analysis.
> 
> **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
> 1. Original video: A high-definition movie file.
> 2. Embedded canaries: Unique identifiers such as slightly altered frames, invisible watermarks, or modified audio samples.
> 3. Leak detection: When a pirated copy is found, studios analyze the video file to extract the embedded canaries and trace back to the source of the leak.
> 
> **Practical Impact**: This method allows movie studios to identify and take action against individuals or groups responsible for leaking content, thereby protecting their intellectual property.

> [!example] Example: Image Steganography
> 
> **Illustrative Example**: An image file where the LSB of each pixel's color value is altered to encode the hidden message.
> 
> **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
> 1. Original image: A standard JPEG image.
> 2. Hidden message: The binary data of the hidden message is split and embedded into the LSB of each pixel.
> 3. Extracting the hidden message involves reading the LSBs of the image pixels and reconstructing the binary data.
