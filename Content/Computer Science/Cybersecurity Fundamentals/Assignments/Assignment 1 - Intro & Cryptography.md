> (1 point) There is a secret passphrase embedded in the file called "**test.txt**" in the folder `/home/student/linux_basics/q01`. The secret can be found **following** the line that begins with the word "**And**" and ends with "**it**". Use grep with regular expression to locate this line and the line following it. What is the passphrase?

> [!solution] Solution
```bash
grep -A 1 '^And.*it$' /home/student/linux_basics/q01/test.txt
And give't Iago: what he will do with it
csf2024s1_{lanceteer-versify-phlogogenous}
```


> [!explanation] Explanation
> The solution uses `grep` with the `-A 1` option to find a line in `test.txt` starting with "And" and ending with "it", then prints this line and the one following it. The regular expression `'^And.*it$'` matches lines that meet these criteria.

Upon examining the output from the `cat` command for the file `linux_basics/q08/secret.enc`, two observations led to the idea that it was Base64 encoded.

> - Second, the string's length being a multiple of 4 further supports this, as Base64 encoded outputs adhere to this length pattern.

> [!explanation] Explanation
> Upon examining the python script used to encode the secret text file, it becomes obvious that it uses a basic XOR encoder with a seed to encode. XOR encoding operates on a simple principle: if you take a piece of data $A$ and a key $B$, and apply XOR ($A \oplus B = C$), you get an encoded output $C$. The magic of XOR is that applying the operation again with the same key ($C \oplus B$) brings back the original data $A$.
> 
> The script also uses a default seed - `312024` when one is not provided. The obvious next step was to deduce that this default seed was indeed used to encode (because what else could be used in this context?), and that the encoded file can be *decoded* by encoding it again.
> 
> This decoding process is mathematically represented as follows: If the original encoding was $A \oplus B = C$, then decoding involves applying $C \oplus B$. Since XOR is its own inverse, we get back $A$. 
> 
> **Is this a good encryption?**  
> No, this is not good encryption. The dependency on a predictable input argument of 'seed' for key generation, rather than utilizing a purely random seed, compromises the encryption's security. This predictability allows for the possibility of brute-forcing the keys. Additionally, the simplicity of using XOR for encryption makes it vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks, where the encryption key can be easily deduced by XORing known plaintext with its corresponding ciphertext.
> 
> **What is the key space?**  
> While Python 3's lack of limitation on the range of integers suggests a large key space, the actual effectiveness of this key space is severely diminished by the encryption scheme's reliance on a predictable 'seed' for key generation. This means that despite theoretically having a large key space, the practical security it offers is much lower because an attacker can systematically guess or brute-force the seed, effectively reducing the key space to a manageable size for attackers.

> [!explanation] Explanation
> In solving the challenge to decrypt a secret message encrypted using Textbook RSA, I utilized the RSA parameters that were provided.
>
> To achieve this, I first defined the RSA parameters in the Python script: the modulus $n$, the prime numbers $p$ and $q$, the public exponent $e$, and crucially, the private exponent $d$. These parameters were all given in hexadecimal format. The private exponent $d$ is especially important because it's used alongside the modulus $n$ to decrypt the message.
>
> I converted the ciphertext from hexadecimal to an integer to prepare it for decryption. This conversion is necessary because the RSA algorithm operates on numerical data. Using the RSA decryption formula: $$plaintext = ciphertext^d \mod n$$I applied the `pow` function in Python to the ciphertext integer, using $d$ and $n$ as arguments. This operation decrypted the ciphertext, yielding the original plaintext message: `csf2024s1_{voteptarius}`.

> [!explanation] Explanation
> - Workshop 2 included an exercise to highlight the issues with ECB encoding, especially in the cases of the image. Since we we're not given the original image to extract headers from, I tried using the original image headers from the workshop. This did not work. I was quite stuck for a while on this, until noticing the name of the encrypted image - `2000x2000_256-color.bmp.` 
> - I created a python script to generate a gradient bmp image of size 2000x2000 at a colour depth of 256 bits. (probably an easier way to do this!). Then I copied the headers  from this generated image, and the rest of the encrypted image into a new file to reveal the ECB encoded image:

# Save the image as BMP

Testing with $n = 3$, we get the following results:

```shell
$ python3 freq.py "crypto/q04/ciphertext.txt" 3
'xut': 15
'cos': 11
'irz': 6
'ctj': 5
'ynj': 4
'rts': 3
'snr': 3
'jte': 3
...
```


> [!explanation] Explanation
> We have some clear winners! `xut` comes in with a score of 15. `cos` with 11. The two most frequent 3-letter words in English are `the` and `was`. For a second, lets assume that `xut` and `cos` translate to `the` and `was`. This means:
> - $x=t$
> - $u=h$
> - $t=e$
> - $c=w$
> - $o=a$
> - $s=s$
> 
> Using these changes, let's run `sed` to replace the words and see what comes out:

```shell
$ cat crypto/q04/ciphertext.txt | sed 's/XUT/THE/g' | sed 's/COS/WAS/g'

> [!explanation] Explanation
> Now we're getting somewhere! Of course we could go further with the analysis, and probably find that `ix` translates to `it`, `ntsx` translates to `best`, etc, but every literature nerd on the planet would be yelling **DICKENS!** at this point. Because my favourite piece of media ever is *The Last of Us Part II*, I've obviously read every piece of work that inspired it ... including *A Tale of Two Cities*.
> 
>- **Theory:** This encoded text is the opening paragraph to **Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities**. I've read it enough times to recognise the very similar structure and commas used. Not to mention the frequency analysis pin pointing `the` and `was`. At this point, I think I can confidently say this was encoded using a **Substituion Cipher**!
