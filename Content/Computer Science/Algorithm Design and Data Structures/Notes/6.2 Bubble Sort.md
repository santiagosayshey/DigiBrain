> Bubble sort is a straightforward, comparison-based sorting algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. While simple and intuitive, making it a common introductory example for sorting algorithms, bubble sort's performance is generally slower on large lists, reflected in its quadratic time complexity.
