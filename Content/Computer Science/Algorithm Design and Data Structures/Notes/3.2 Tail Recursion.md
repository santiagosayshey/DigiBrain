# The Cost of Recursion
- Each call to a function adds another frame on the stack
- Each frame contains local variables and parameters and where to return the result

## Stack Frame
- Local variables
- Parameters
- Return address  

## Recursive Facotorial Example
- How many stack frames would be created for `factorial(5)`?, 100, 1000?

```cpp
int factorial(n) {
	// base case
	if (n<2)
		return 1
		
	// recursive case
	return (n*factorial(n-1))
}
```

- 5 stack frames would be called for factorial (5)
	- Needs to call factorial(4),(3), etc until it makes it to the base class
	- Imagine what it would take for `factorial(1000)`

- For `fibonacci(100)`?

```cpp
int fibonacci(n)
	// base class
	if (n==0 | n==1)
		return n

	// recursive class
	return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

- Each call would need to call 2 more stack frames
	- 1 frame turns into 2 frames, turns into 4 frames, turns into 8 frames, turns into 16 frames, etc
	- So it would take 2^n stack frames
	- For `fibonacci(100)`, it needs to have 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376. stack frames. That's way too many
		- Imagine how many times its repeating the same stack frame. The base case must be called a hundred times!

- We can reduce what needs to be stored in order to free up memory in the stack
	- If we can guarantee we won't need them, we can free the memory for the local variables and parameters
	- We won't need them as long as we do not use them after the recursive call
	- Tail recursive functions have the recursive call as the last thing the function does before it returns


## Stack Frame
- ~~Local variables~~
- ~~Parameters~~
- Return address  

## Tail Recursive Factorial Example

```cpp
int factorial(n, acc) {
	// base case
	if (n<2)
		return acc;
		
	// recursive case
	return (factorial(n-1,n*acc))
}
```

- In this example, we can see that the `acc` value starts with the base case and works its way up to the top


# Dynamic Programming
- Simple concept - save already calculated values for reuse

## Memoisation
- Store values as they are calculated
- Usually achievable with a map, assign a key value pairs inside a static map and check if one of those pairs have been calcuated by iterating through the map

## Tabulation
- Calculate values in advance and then look up when needed
- Done with arrays
