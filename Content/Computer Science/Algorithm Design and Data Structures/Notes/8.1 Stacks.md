- Are an ADT that can be implemented using linked lists or dynamic arrays (vectors)
- Stacks are last in, first out
	- This means the most recent elements are stored at the top, oldest at the bottom
	- Like loading a truck
- Require the following behaviours:

1. `push(item)`
- This will insert an item into the top of the stack

- Complexity - O(1) ( linked list implementation )

- Complexity - O(1) (usually, vector implementation)

2. `pop()`
- This will remove the newest item from the top of the stack

- Complexity - O(1) (linked list implementation)

- Complexity - O(1) (vector implementation)

3. `isEmpty()`
- Will return true / false depending on if the stack has elements or not
- Using a linked list implementation, this involves checking if the dead is set to a null value
- Using a vector implementation, this involves checking if the size of the vector is 0
- Is a precondition for `pop()`
- Complexity - O(1)

## Implementing Stacks

### With LinkedLists
- Implemented the same way as a linked list
	- The head of the linked list is the "top"
	- Each node points to the node below them
- push = insertFront
- pop = removeFront
- isEmpty = check if top is null


```cpp
class stack {
	Node* top;

	public:
		push(int d) {
			Node* newNode = new Node(d, head);
			top = newNode;
		}
		// etc
}
```

### WIth Vectors
- Implemented as having a data structure that has a vector object as a variable
- push = push_back();
- pop = pop_back();
- isEmpty = size();

```cpp
class Stacl {
	int top;
	std::vector<int> v;

	public:
		push(int d) {
			v.push_back(d);
		}
		// etc
}
```
