# What is Recursion?
- Recusion is a programming technique that allows us to solve problems by brekaing the problem down into smaller problems that can be solved using the same algorithm

```
countDescendants(person) =
sum for all children of person
countDescendants(child)
```

# Requirements For Recursion to Work

## Base Case
- There must be some case where an answer can be returned otherwise the recursion will go on forever

## Recursive Call on Sub Problem
- The subproblem MUST be closer to the base case
	- Each sub problem must get closer and closer to the base case

## Combining Subproblem Solutions into a Single Solution
- How do we create the answer from the sub answers?


# Examples

## Recursive Factorial Function
- Factorial of n, written as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than n

```
n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * ... * n
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
```

- This is an iterative way of expressing a factorial
- We can also express factorials recusively

```
n! = n * (n-1)!
```

- As a recursive function:

```cpp
int factorial(n)
{
	// base case
	if (n<2)
		return 1;
		
	// recursive case
	return (n*factorial(n-1))
}
```

1. Write a recursive function to sum the integers from 1 to n
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int sum(int n)
{
	if (n<2)
		return 1;
	return n+sum(n-1);
}

int main() {
	std::cout << sum(100) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

2. Write a recursive function that implements x^n

```cpp
int power(int x, int n)
{
	if (n<1)
	return 1;
	return x*power(x,n-1);
}

  

int main() {
	std::cout << power(9,9) << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```
