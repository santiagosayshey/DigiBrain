 - The tree data type captures the idea of individual pieices of data that are related by their position - like individual leaves that all belong to one of many branches that are all part of one tree
 - This can help us to efficiently organise ordered data
 - Trees are upside down

## Properties
- Trees have a height (how many edges between two furthest nodes)
- Nodes have a depth (How many edges is it removed from the root)
- Nodes hava a degree (How many children does the node have)
- Nodes have a 
- Acyclic (cant go in a loop)
- Connected
- Have exactly one simple path between any two nodes


## Implementing a Tree

```cpp
#ifndef TREE
#define TREE

#include <vector>

template <class T>
class Tree
{
private:
    struct Node
    {
        T data;
        std::vector<Node *> childNodes;
    };
    Node *root;

public:
    Tree()
    {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    void insert(T value)
    {
        Node * newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        // add node to tree - dependent on type of tree
    }

    void remove(T value)
    {
        // delete from tree - dependent on type of tree
    }

    bool search(T value)
    {
        bool found = false;
        // returns true if value found in tree, false if not found
        return found;
    }
};

#endif
```

```cpp
#include "Tree.h"  
int main(void) {  
	Tree<int> myTree;  
	myTree.insert(5);  
	myTree.search(5);  
	myTree.remove(5);  
}
```
