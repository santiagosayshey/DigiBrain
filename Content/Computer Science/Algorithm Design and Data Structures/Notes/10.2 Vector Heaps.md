- Can be implemented with arrays / vectors due to relationship between the location of parents and children
- Improves time complexity

```cpp
vector<char> heap = {A,D,C,H,E,F,G,I}
```

- Relationships:
	- A child at index `c`, has a parent at `floor((c-1)/2)`
	- A parent at index `p`, has children at `2p+1` and `2p+2`

```cpp
vector<char> heap = {A,D,C,H,E,F,G,I}
```

- Child E is at index 4
- (4-1)/2 = 1
	- heap[1] is D

## Building a Heap with Vectors
- Build a heap wiht the values: 4,5,3,6,1,2
- Add all values to the vector in that order


```cpp
vector<char> heap = {4,5,3,6,1,2}
```

- Index of last non lead node (last parent node) will be at n/2 -1 `(6/2 - 1 = 2)`
- Current parent index = index
- Until current parent index < 0
	- Heapify at current parent index
	- Current parent index--

### Heapifying
- Heapify at a given parent node index `p`
	- Find smallest value of node's children
		- Nodes at `2p + 1` and `2p + 2`
	- If smaller than node value, swap value at parent and child indexes


```cpp
vector<char> heap = {4,5,3,6,1,2}
```

- Current p at position 2 {value of 3)
- Children at position 5 and 6 (5 only exists with value of 2)
- 2 is the smaller of the children, and is smaller than parent (3)
	- Swap 2 and 3

```cpp
vector<char> heap = {4,5,2,6,1,3}
```

- Do this until p < 0

```cpp
vector<char> heap = {4,1,2,6,5,3}
```

```cpp
vector<char> heap = {1,4,2,6,5,3}
```
