- An ADT implemented using a linked list
- Queues are first in, first out
	- This means the most recent elements are stored at the top, oldest at the bottom
	- Like people lining up for something
- Have access to the top AND bottom of the queue

- Require the following behaviours

1. `enqueue()`
- Adds a new element to the back / tail of the queue

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230501015920.png]]

- Complexity - O(1)

2. `dequeue()`
- Removes the head / front elements from the queue

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230501020022.png]]

- Complexity - O(1)

3. `isEmpty()`
- Checks if the head AND tail are set to a null value
- Is a precondition for `dequeue()`
- Complexity - O(1)

## Implementing Queues
- Implemented efficiently using a linked list, and less with a vector

### With LinkedLists
- Implemented the same way as a linked list with a tail
	- The head of the linked list is the font and the tail is the back
	- Each node points to the node in front of them
- enqueue = insertFront
- dequeue = removeFront
- isEmpty = check if front / tail is null


```cpp
class stack {
	Node* front, back;

	public:
		enqueue(int d) {
			Node* newNode = new Node(d, back);
			back = newNode;
		}
		// etc
}
```

### WIth Vectors
- Possible to have constant time for back / front insertion
- push = push_back();
- pop = pop_back();
- isEmpty = size();

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Queue
{
    int front, rear, size;
    unsigned capacity;
    int* array;
public:
    Queue(unsigned c)
    {
        front = size = 0;
        capacity = c;
        rear = capacity - 1;
        array = new int[capacity];
    }

    bool isFull()
    {
        return (size == capacity);
    }

    bool isEmpty()
    {
        return (size == 0);
    }

    void enqueue(int item)
    {
        if (isFull())
        {
            cout << "Queue is full.\n";
            return;
        }
        rear = (rear + 1) % capacity;
        array[rear] = item;
        size = size + 1;
        cout << item << " enqueued to queue.\n";
    }

    int dequeue()
    {
        if (isEmpty())
        {
            cout << "Queue is empty.\n";
            return INT_MIN;
        }
        int item = array[front];
        front = (front + 1) % capacity;
        size = size - 1;
        return item;
    }

    int frontElement()
    {
        if (isEmpty())
            return INT_MIN;
        return array[front];
    }

    int rearElement()
    {
        if (isFull())
            return INT_MIN;
        return array[rear];
    }
};

```

This is a simple Queue class. It contains:

-   `enqueue()`: Adds an item to the queue. It changes `rear` and `size`.
-   `dequeue()`: Removes an item from the queue. It changes `front` and `size`.
-   `isFull()`: Checks if the queue is full.
-   `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
-   `frontElement()`: Gets the front item from the queue.
-   `rearElement()`: Gets the last item from the queue.

The time complexity for `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `isFull()`, `isEmpty()`, `frontElement()`, and `rearElement()` operations are all O(1).
