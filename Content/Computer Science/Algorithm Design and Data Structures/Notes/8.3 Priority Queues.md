- Allows some elements to be treated like they're at the top of queue, even when they aren't
- Have the same methods as a normal queue
- `enqueue(item, priority)` introduces a new parameter `priority
- Have access to both the front and back of the queue

## Implementation
1. Use a single queue

- Modify our insertion or deletion operations, either:
1. O(1) insertion and O(n) deletion
