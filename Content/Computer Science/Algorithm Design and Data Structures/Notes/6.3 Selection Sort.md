> Selection sort is a straightforward, in-place sorting algorithm that improves data organization by repeatedly selecting the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted segment and moving it to the end of the sorted segment. Although simple and not dependent on data distribution, its quadratic time complexity makes it less efficient for large datasets. However, its ease of understanding and implementation, alongside minimal space requirements, makes it a valuable educational tool.
