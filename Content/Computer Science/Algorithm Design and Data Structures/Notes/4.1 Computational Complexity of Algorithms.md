- Algorithms must be **smart** and **efficient**

## Atomic Operations

- A program that encodes an algorithm consists of atomic operations
- Example:
	- Initalising sum to 0 is an atomic operation
	- Initalising i to 0 and iterating i are atomic operations
	- Increasing sum by i is an atomic operation

```cpp
int sum=0;

for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {
	sum+=i;
}
```

- To calculate the computatational complexity of the time of the program, we:
	- Split the program up into individial atomic operations
	- Calcuate time for each operation
	- Sum each time together

### Atomic Operations and their Complexity

```cpp
a+b;
d=a+b;
a-b;
a*b;
...
if (a>b) {...}
```

- To complete this function `n` times
- Overall time = `c+c+...+c` = `nc`

## Best / Worst Cases & Lower / Upper Bounds

### Input Size
- Assuming that the input size is `n`, we are trying to find a function `f(n)` that will give us a time our algorithm runs
- Most of the time, we are interested in how the algorithm behaves for large inputs of data (`n` is large)

### Exhaustive Search Algorithm

```cpp
...
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
	if (a[i] == value)
		return i; // found it!
	 ...
}
```

- Input size: `n`
- We need to find `f(n)`

### Shortest Route

- Input size: `v`, where `v` is the number of points
- We need to find `f(v)`

### Lower / Upper Bounds

- We are interested in asymptotic behaviour (when n tends to infinity)
- It is hard to get the exact value of `f(n)`, but we can try to find lower and upper bounds!

### Best, Average and Worst Cases

- It is easier to find lower and upper bounds if we consider the best, average and worst cases
- Recall the `exhaustive search algorithm`

#### Worst Case

- The worst case would be the last element in the array
	- c1 and c2 atomic operation will be executed `n times`

#### Best Case
- The best case would be the first element in the array
	- c1 and c2 atomic operations will be executed `1 time`
