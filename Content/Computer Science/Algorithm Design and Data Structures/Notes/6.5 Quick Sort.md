> Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a [[Divide & Conquer]] strategy to sort elements. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. Quick sort then recursively applies the same strategy to the sub-arrays. This algorithm is known for its superior average-case performance and its ability to sort in-place, making it a popular choice despite its worst-case quadratic time complexity. Its performance highly depends on the pivot selection method.
