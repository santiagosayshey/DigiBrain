# Coupling and Cohesion
- Requirements change over time, so you chould design for change
- Well designed OO code is: 

## Loosely Coupled
- Minimise the dependance of a class on other classes so that if a class needs to change, the least number of other classes needs to be updated

## Highly Cohesive
- Every object  should have a focus and all values / behaviours related to that focus should be collected into the class and *only* those values and behaviours


# Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should only have 1 reason to change
- Ask these questions:
	- What is the main purpose of this class?
	- Do all of the variables and members relate to this one specific class?
	- Who might you want to change your class? (Only one person)

```
Classes must have variables and functions relating to only that class
```

```cpp
/* Example of **violation** of Single Responsibility Principle */  
class Student {  
	std::string name;  
	std::string ID;  
	int unitsTaken;  
	// what happens if we decide that we want to print  
	// fractional grades - ie change grades to floats?  
	vector<int> grades;  
public:  
	std::string getName() {...}  
	
	std::string getID() {...}  
	
	void printGradeReport() {  
		for (int i = 0; i < grades.size(); i++) {  
			std::cout << grades.at(i) << endl;  
		}  
	}  
	
	int calculateGPA() {  
		gpa = 0;  
		for (int i = 0; i < grades.size(); i++) {  
			int grade = grades.at(i);  
			if (grade < 50 && grade > 0)  
				gpa = gpa + 1.5;  
			else if (grade < 65)  
				gpa = gpa + 4;  
			else if (grade < 75)  
				gpa = gpa + 5;  
			else if (grade < 85)  
				gpa = gpa + 6;  
			else  
				gpa = gpa + 7;  
		}  
		return gpa/unitsTaken;  
	}  
}
```

- To fix this, we should create a new class only to calculate GPA as it can only be used for one purpose

# Open-Closed Principle
- A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification
	- Classes should be designed for extension
	- Use polymorphism to add additional types of behaviours rather than adding code in a class to check which behaviour is needed

```
Don't change implicit behaviour, rather expand upon it using polymporhism
```

```cpp
/* Example of **violation** of Open Closed Principle */
/* adapted from: Robert Martin - "Design Principles and Patterns"*/

class Modem {
};

class Hayes public Modem {
    public:
        std::string getType() {return "Hayes"};
}

class Courier public Modem {
    public:
        std::string getType() {return "Courier"};
};
	/* nested ifs choosing the right code based on specific values
    is a common feature when this principle is violated.  To add
    new Modem types, we must modify the LogOn code which violates
    the Open Closed Principle */

class ModemInterface {
	public:
		void LogOn(Modem m) {
			if (m.getType() == "Hayes")
				// do logon procedure for Hayes type modem
			else if (m.getType() == "Courier")
				....
}
```

- To fix this, implement polymorphism in a logon function that can be overriden with each child function. No need to use if /  else statements to test what class is being used

# Liskov Substitution Principle
- Subclasses should be subsitutable for thier base classes
	- Any behaviour in the base class should also be a nessecary part of the child class
	- The mistake made here is often because we use inheritance for classes related by features, rather than behaviours

```
Child classes must have the same behaviour and variables as their parent class
```

```cpp
/* Example of **violation** of Liskov Substitution Principle */
/* adapted from: Robert Martin - "Design Principles and Patterns"*/

class Ellipse {
    private:
        Point focusA;
        Point focusB;
        double majorAxes;
    public:
        double circumference();
        Point getFocusA();
        void setFoci(Point a, Point b);
        ....
};

class Circle public Ellipse {
};

int main(void) {
    Ellipse myCircle;
    Point a(3,0);
    Point b(-3,0);

    // Circles can not have different foci!
    // but if it is an ellipse, this should
    // be possible.

    myCircle.setFoci(a, b);
}
```

- Both should be sub classes of a shape class, not circle from shape

# Interface Segregation Principle
- Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
	- If there are many ways your class may take input, create classes for these different inputs so that the client only needs to know about the one they want to use
	- Use polymorphism!
		- Our class can take an input which all of the different classes inherit from

```
Don't use a single class to define multiple different (but similar behaviours)
```

```cpp
/* Example of **violation** of Interface Segregation Principle */
/* adapted from: Robert Martin - "Design Principles and Patterns"*/
// users of the class aren't going to need all of these!

class Human {
    getMoveFromKeyboard();
    getMoveFromGUI();
    getMoveFromNetwork();
};
```

# Dependancy Inversion Principle
- Depend upon abstractions - do not depend upon concretions
	- In OO design, class implementations depend upon higher level abstractions (child classes depend on parent classes)
	- Classes should use interfaces / abstract classes where possible, rather than specific implementations

```
Use abstract classes where possible
```

```cpp
/* Example of **violation** of Dependency Inversion Principle */

class Human {
    ...
};

class Computer {
    ...
};

class Referee {
    // referee now depends on concrete classes
    // dependencies should be on abstract classes
    string refGame(Human h, Computer c);
};
```

# Key C++ Implementation
1. Always use header guards

```cpp
#ifndef class_name
#define class_name

...

#endif
```

2. Never use `using namespace std` in a header file
3. If you are using a library function or class, include it, even if the parent class already includes it.
4. Class methods should NOT print output, unless it's their primary purpose
