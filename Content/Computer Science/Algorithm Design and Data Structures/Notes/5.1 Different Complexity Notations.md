- Defined as the lower bounds
- Is f(n) faster than g(n)

- Defined as the tight bound
- In Big O AND Big Ω

- Upper bound

## Summary 

- Big O and Little o are upper bounds
	- Little o is stronger than Big o because it does not allow for the same growth rate 
	- g(n) grows faster than f(n)
- Big Ω is a lower bound
- Big θ is a tight bound (upper and lower together)

- Big O is asking:
	- Is f(n) slower than g(n)
- Little o is asking:
	- Is f(n) strictly slower than g(n), can't be equal 
- Big Ω is asking:
	- Is f(n) faster than g(n)
- Big θ is asking:
	- is f(n) the same as g(n) (disregarding constants)
