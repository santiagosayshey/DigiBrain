> Selection sort is a simple, in-place sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the beginning and the unsorted part at the rest. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted segment and swapping it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted part. Despite its simplicity, selection sort has fixed time complexity, making it inefficient for large lists but intuitive for educational purposes and small datasets.
