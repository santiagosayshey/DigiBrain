- Are a tree data structure that are particularly suited for searching for keys that begin with a specific prefix
- Usually, these keys are strings
- Each path from root presents one key

## Properties
- A node may have any number of children 'k-ary tree'
- All keys with a given prefix are found on the same path within the trie

```cpp
// trie node
struct TrieNode {
	bool isEndOfWord;
	vector<TrieNode*> children;
};
```

## Adding Keys to a Trie
- While the key forms a path in the trie
	- Follow the trie while next key character matches the characters in trie
- Add remaining non-matching key characters to tree, mark node with last character as end of word
- Example Insert 'ape' and 'apes'
	- Nodes colored red have `isEndofWord` == true


## Deleting Keys from a Trie

### Pseudocode

```cpp
if root of current tree is nullptr, key is not a tree, return nullptr
if depth == key length (end of key)
	if node isEndOfWord, isEndOfWord = false
	if no children set root to nullptr (and free memory)
	return root
 (not end of key) set next child = delete(child, key, depth +1)
	if no children set root to nullptr (and free memory)
	return root

	delete `ape`
```
