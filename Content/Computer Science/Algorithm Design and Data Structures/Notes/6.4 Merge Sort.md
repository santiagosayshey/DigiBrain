### Merge Sort

> [!idea]
> Merge sort is an efficient, comparison-based, [[Divide & Conquer]] sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This algorithm is known for its consistent performance across different types of datasets, with a time complexity that makes it highly efficient for large datasets. Unlike some other sorting algorithms, merge sort requires additional space, but its stability and efficiency make it a preferred choice for complex sorting tasks.
