- Is a binary tree where smaller values are higher in a tree path (min heap), or larger values are higher (max heap)
- Heaps are ordered binary trees
- Commonly used to implement priority queues
- Assume the lower value has the highest priority, Would you store values in a min heap or max heap?
- What is the complexity of finding the highest priority value

## Properties
- Every level above bottom is filled
- Bottom level is filled from left to right
- Parent is smaller (min heap) than all of it's children

## Insertion
- Heaps always insert into the bottom level, inserting left tor ight
- Restore any out of line properties

## Deletion
- Heaps always replace deleted node with the rightmost node of bottom level
- We then restore the heap property

1. Delete B and replace with bottom most node

2. Restore heap properties

## Building a Heap
- You can build a heap from scratch by just inserting the elements one by one, but this is inefficient O(nlogn)
- Building bottum up can achieve O(n)
	- Add all nodes
	- Starting from bottom rightmost parent, restore each sub heap

### Heapifying (Building Backwards from Bottom - Up)
- Build a heap with values: 4,5,3,6,1,2
	- Add all to heap in that order
	- Restore heap by 'sifiting' parent nodes down (if they are larger than a child)
	- This builds heap in O(n)
