# Example: Dynamic View Counter
- Say we want to create a counter that shows how many times a button has been pushed
	- Write a basic HTML page
		- Include a counter and a button that increments the counter
	- What will happen if we now serve this from express as a static page?
	- What if we wanted the counter to represent the number of times the page was loaded rather than the number of times the user pressed the button?
	- What if we wanted the counter to represent the number of times anyone in the world pressed the button on that page?

## State Information
- The information needs to be remembered somewhere!
	- Options:
		- Store the value of the variable on the web server in our javascript
		- Save the value in a file on the server and read / write as needed
		- Store the value in a database and query / update as needed
	- Howver the data is stored, it needs to be inserted into the web page before we send it to the client
- How? With Routes!

## Routes
- Routes are special functions that we can define on our server to perform actions when a given path is requested
- `routes` contain Node.js code files for serving dynamic content
- `routes/index.js` contains basic dynamic routes

```js
var counter=0;                                // global counter
router.get('/count', function(req, res) { 
	counter++;
	console.log(String(counter));
});
```

### Sending a Reponse

- We don't want to just print the output, we want to send a HTTP response to the client
	- The `res` object that express passes to our function helps us here
		- `router.get('/count', function(req, res)
		- `res` represents the HTTP response that express sends
	- One of the methods of the response object res, is the send method
		- `res.send([body])`
		- The body is the HTTP response body. Can be a string (html web page), or data

```js
router.get('/test', function(req, res) { 
	res.send("This is a test"); 
});
```

- We can use `res.send()` to send our message to the browser instead of the console

```js
var counter=0;                                // global counter
router.get('/count', function(req, res) { 
	counter++;
	res.send(String(counter));
});
```

# Dynamic Web Pages
- Cornerstone of the modern internet, allowing us to make complex websites
1. A user makes a request
2. The request is processed
3. Custom content is generated
4. The content is combined with the HTML to create the webpages
5. The **whole** page is send in response

```js
var counter=0;                                // global counter
router.get('/count', function(req, res) { 
	counter++;
	res.send(/*html page goes here*/);
});
```
