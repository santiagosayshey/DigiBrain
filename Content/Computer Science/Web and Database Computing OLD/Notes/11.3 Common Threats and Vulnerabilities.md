## 1. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
- Occurs when user's input is stored and displayed to other users of the same site
	- If the input is not properly sanitised, an attacker can write javascript code instead of normal input, that gets run when another user interacts with the page displaying
	- This attack is mitigated by sanitising the input and output of user data

## 2. SQL Injection
- SQL Injection can occur when a user's input is used as part of a SQL query
	- If the input is not properly sanitised, an attacker can write SQL code instead of normal input to extract data from, or manipulate the database in ways they shouldn't be authorised to
	- This attack is mitigated using Prepared Statements

## 3. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF)
- Occurs when a website allows requests that originated from other websites
	- If a user is logged into a vulnerable site, and then accesses a malicious site, a HTTP request sent from the malicious site will contain the user's session token
	- The malicious site can make requests as that user via the user's browser (Using AJAX or just regular form input)
	- This attack is mitigated by preventing requests from outside your own website (achieved using a special header sent by all browsers), or by using a single-use toekn with all forms
		- Express has this functionality built in and will protected against this type of attack unless it is explicitly diabled
		- This attack is becoming less effective as browsers and servers are building in protections against it
