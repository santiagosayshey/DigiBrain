## Why is Design Important
- Design has an impact on user trust
- Design makes a good first impression
- Design reflects value / quality of goods and services offered

### Think About the Users!
- Imagine that you are the user

#### How do I see the webpage?
- Think about how you view webpages
	- Do you read the whole page top to bottom
- Users `scan` webpages to locate relevant and useful information
- Optimising your website foir this behavriour will make easier to use and keep visitors for longer
	- Avoid large blobs of text; use short paragraphs for key concepts
	- Use style to differentiate content
	- Use visual elements wherever  possible

#### What Information Do I Want?
- Consider preference vs Usability
- Does your website have the information I want (in an easily accessibly way), or what you think they want?

#### What Should I See the First Time I Visit?
- What is the most important thing we want users to do when they visit our web application?
	- How can we convince them to do it?

- Search bar is front and center

#### How Will I Navigate the Webpage?

##### Home / Landing Page
- Your home page is the gateway to your website
- Home page has to accomodate
	- Site identity and mission
	- Site heirachy
		- The home page has to give an overview of what the site has to offer - both content ( What cant I find here? ) and features ( What can I do here? ) - and how it's all organised
	- Search
		- Most sites need to have a prominently displayed search box on the home page
	- Timely Content
		- If the site's success depends on my coming back often, the home page needs to have some content that gets updated frequently
	- Shortcuts
	- Registration

##### Navigation Control

- Main navigation may be at the top for short lists or left for long lists ( accordion lists for very long menus )
- Top links can look like tabs to provide context
- Account information is often on the top right ( users expect it to be there )
- Minor details on the bottom (contact, help, blog, etc)
- Try to associate icons with items in a menu (visual recognition)

##### Tell Users Where They Are
- Every page should have a visible name in the same place
- The name should match what the user clicked to get there
- Make use of breadcrumbs (pointers that show which section of a website a user is at)

##### Navigation Considerations
- When I log in, where do I land?
- Design for search-dominant and link-dominant users
- Not just about reducing clicks, each one should be unambiguous and require no thought
- Browser back buttons should work
- Be consistent
- Design the navigation around the core scenario
