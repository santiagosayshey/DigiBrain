## Doing More with SQL

### SQL Inbuilt Functions
- Queries allow us to do basic data retrieval, but sometimes we need to modify, format, or do calculations on data being used in, or returned from a query
	- Most SQL dialets have a number of built in functions that allow you to do these sorts of operations in your queries
		- MySQL Functions:
			- String and Text manipulation
			- Numeric and Math operations
			- Data and Time manipulation
			- Encryption and Compression
			- Control Flow
			- Data Sorting / Grouping

#### MySQL Function Usage
- Work similarly to functions in most programming languages

```sql
FUNCTION_NAME(param1, ...)
```

- The function is run for every row in the table / result set it is applied to
- The return vcalue of the functions can be used in the query or result

```sql
-- Can apply to the result
SELECT ROUND(column1) FROM TableA WHERE column1 > 5;

-- Or elsewhere in the query
SELECT column1 FROM TableA WHERE ROUND(column1) > 5;
```

### Using Multiple Queries Together
- We've alread seen how we can combine the reuslts of multiple queries into a single result using `UNION` and `INTERSECT` operations
- Sometimes we may want to use the results of a query as part of another query

#### Subqueries
**Subqueries** allows us to use one or a set of results from a query inside another query

```sql
SELECT * FROM TableA
	WHERE column1 = (SELECT column2 FROM TableB
						WHERE column2 = 'a');
```

- A subquery must always return only a single column
	- It can return mulitple rows, but if it does, you must use set operations

```sql
-- This query only works if the subquery returns 1 row
SELECT * FROM TableA
	WHERE column1 = (SELECT column2 FROM TableB);

-- This query works with mulitple rows returned by the subquery
SELECT * FROM TableA
	WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column2 FROM Tableb);
```

### Code Reuse

#### Stored Procedures
- Allow us to store commonly used queries that can be called for later using their name

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
	sql_statement
GO;
```

- Run using `EXEC`

```sql
EXEC procedure_name;
```

##### Parameters
- We can also have stored procedures with parameters:
`
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name @Param1 data_type, @Param2 data_type ...
AS
	sql_statement
GO;
```

```sql
EXEC procedure_name Param1 = 'value';
```

###### Example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE getUsers @username nvarchar(30), @email nvarchar(50)
AS
	SELECT * FROM Users
	WHERE username = @username OR email = @email
GO;
```

#### Views
- Another code reuse technique is through the use of Virtual Tables, known as Views
	- A view is a `TABLE` created by a `SELECT` statment
	- Whenever the table is queried, the query is performed on the results of the select statement
		- Allows us to simulate derived attributes

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name
AS
	select_statement;
```

- No `GO` keyword is needed

###### Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW RecentCustomers
AS
	SELECT * FROM Customers
		WHERE cust_id IN
			(SELECT cust_id FROM Purchases
				WHERE DATEDIFF(Now(), purchase_date) < 7);
```
