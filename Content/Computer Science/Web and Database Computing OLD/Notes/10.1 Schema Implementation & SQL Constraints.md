## Schemas Revisited
- The schema defines the relational model for a database; how data is divided into tables in Database design has an impact on storage requirements and efficiency of accessing data
- Good schema design delivers:
	- Minimal redundancy of information
		- The same information should not appear in multiple places
	- Easy to understand the relationship of the data
		- Information is properly organised or split into logical pieces making it easy to access
	- Database performs fast and efficiently
		- Data is organised to find information, with fewer steps, and without retrieving more data than needed
- Important because most web apps are transaction intensive, i.e. Users are often creating, reading, updating and deleting data

## How Can Schemas be Improved?

### Integrity Constraints
- Conditions put in place on the database to:
	- Guard against accidental damage to the database
	- Ensure that changes don't result in a loss of consistency in the data
	- Restrict valid values for data
	- Ensure that related data is delete from all tables
- Examples:
	- Key declaration: Definition of primary keys means that updates are constrained
	- Mapping Cardinality: Constrains the set of relationships
	- Value Constraints: Ensure that values in a given column are restricted to meet specif

#### Primary and Composite Keys
- Specift a single primary key or composite key after the column names
	- Primary Key `PRIMARY KEY (column_name)`
	- Composite Key `PRIMARY KEY (column1_name, column2_name)`

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
	id INT,
	name VARCHAR(30),
	street VARCHAR(50),
	suburb VARCHAR(30),
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

#### Foreign Keys
- In relational databases, foreign kets are used to establish a relationship between two tables
- A foreign key is a set of attributes that refer to a primary key of another table that the table has a relationship with
- Specify one or more foreign keys after the primary / composite key
	- Single foreign key: `FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES RelationshipTable(column_name)`  
	- Each foreign key needs its own declaration


```sql
CREATE TABLE Order (
	order_id INT,
	cust_id INT,
	PRIMARY KEY (order_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES Customer(cust_id)
);
```

### Referential Integrity
- Ensures that valyes that appear in one table for a given set of attributes also appear for a ceratin set of attributes in another table
- It asks:
	- What requirements do our relationships have?
	  What happens to related data when I delete something?

#### Example:
- If a customer has several bank accounts, then deleting the customer from the system should also delete all of their accounts.

#### In SQL
- Referential Integrity in SQL is built upon the relationships defined using **foreign keys**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
	id INT,
	name VARCHAR(30),
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

- We can declare a foreign key using the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Account (
	number INT,
	cust_id INT,
	name VARCHAR(30),
	open_date DATE,
	PRIMARY KEY (number),
	FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES Customer(cust_id)
);
```

- Depending on the relationship, we can select actions to occur when an entity involved in some relationship is deleted

##### Set Null
- Use when the relationship is optional; not all rows in the FK table are involved in the relationship
- Use the `ON DELETE SET NULL` clause to indicate that when the main entity is delete, the value of the foreign key in the associated entity is set to NULL

```sql
CREATE TABLE Account (
	number INT,
	cust_id INT.
	name VARCHAR(30),
	open_date DATE,
	PRIMARY KEY (number),
	FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES Customer(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

##### No Action
- Use when the relationship is required, but the row's existence is not defined by the relationship
	- Example:  All ordered items have to be contained in orders
- Use the `ON DELETE NO ACTION` clause to indicate that the main entity cannot be delete if it has an association with another entity

```sql
CREATE TABLE Inventory (
	inventory_id INT,
	product id INT NOT NULL,
	quantity INT,
	PRIMARY KEY (inventory_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Product(id) ON DELETE NO ACTION
);
```

##### Cascase
- Use when the relationship is required, and the row's existence is defined by the relationship
	- Example: Foreign Key is also part of the table's Primary Key
- Use the `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause to indicate that when the main entity is deleted, all associated entities for that Foreign Key will also be deleted

```sql
CREATE TABLE OrderedItem (
	order_id INT,
	item_id INT,
	quantity INT,
	PRIMARY KEY (order_id, item_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Order(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### Value Integrity
- Ensures that values for a given column are valud
- Example:
	- A customer's shopping care cannot have fewer than 0 items
- Value integrity in SQL Is achieved using a nunber of additional clauses when creating tables

#### Check Clause
- The `CHECK` clause parmits attributes to be restricted to a predefined set or series of values

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
	id INT,
	LastName VARCHAR(255),
	FirstName VARCHAR(255),
	Age INT,
	City VARCHAR(255),
	CHECK (Age>18 AND City='Adelaide')
);
```

- We can also name constraints
	- Use `CONSTRAINT name`
	- Useful to indicate which constraint an update violated:

```sql
CONSTRAINT UnderAge CHECK (Age>18)
```

##### Other Constraints
- `UNIQUE`
	- Values in this columns are all different; no dupes
- `NOT NULL`
	- Values in this column can not be `NULL`
- `DEFAULT`
	- Sets a default value
- `AUTO_INCREMENT`
	- Is used with numeric data to set the value to a number that increases by 1 for each new row
		- We don't need to specify these columns in `INSERT` queries
- Examples:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Account (
	number INT UNIQUE AUTO_INCREMENT,
	branch_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
	balance number(5) DEFAULT 0
);
```
