> | `5n log n ∈ O(n log n)`           | `n · log(n)` is an upper bound for `5n · log(n)`                 | True   | Dropping constants, it's the same function. Therefore, it's a tight bound and also an upper bound. |
> | `5n log n ∈ O(n^2)`               | `n^2` is an upper bound for `5n · log(n)`                        | True   | As `n` grows, `n^2` increases faster than `n log n`, making `n^2` an upper bound.                 |
> | `5n log n ∈ Ω(n^2)`               | `n^2` is a lower bound for `5n · log(n)`                         | False  | `n log n` grows slower than `n^2`, so `n^2` cannot be a lower bound for `5n log n`.              |
> | `5n log n ∈ o(n^2)`               | `5n · log(n)` grows strictly slower than `n^2`                   | True   | For very large `n`, `n^2` grows much faster than `n log n`, so `5n log n` is in `o(n^2)`.        |
> | `5n log n + n^2 ∈ O(n log n)`     | `n · log(n)` is an upper bound for `5n · log(n) + n^2`           | False  | `n^2` term dominates as `n` grows, so `n log n` cannot be an upper bound for the sum.             |
> | `5n log n + n^2 ∈ O(n^2)`         | `n^2` is an upper bound for `5n · log(n) + n^2`                  | True   | `n^2` is the highest order term, making it the tight bound and thus also an upper bound.           |
