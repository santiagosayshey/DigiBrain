> [!idea]+ Radix Sort
>
> Radix Sort is an efficient, non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. It uses Counting Sort as a stable subroutine to sort the numbers in each pass.
>
> The key advantages of Radix Sort are:
> 1. It has a linear time complexity of $O(d * (n + k))$, where $d$ is the number of digits, $n$ is the number of elements, and $k$ is the range of input.
> 2. It is a stable sort, preserving the relative order of elements with equal keys.
> 3. It can be optimized by using a larger radix, reducing the number of passes required to sort the numbers.
>
> However, Radix Sort has some limitations:
> 1. It is only suitable for integers or elements that can be represented as integers.
> 2. The space complexity is $O(n + k)$, which can be significant for large datasets or a large range of input.
> 3. The performance depends on the number of digits and the radix chosen. Choosing an optimal radix is crucial for efficiency.

> [!consider] Consider the use of different radixes
>
> Given:
> - You have an array of $n = 1,000,000$ numbers, each represented using $b = 64$ bits.
> - You want to sort these numbers using Radix Sort.
>
> **Question:**
> What will be the time complexity of Radix Sort if you treat the numbers as:
> 1. Four-digit numbers with a radix of $2^{16}$?
> 2. Sixteen-digit numbers with a radix of $2^4$?
>
> **Step 1: Determine the number of passes required for each radix.**
> a) With a radix of $2^{16}$, we group 16 bits together. The number of passes required is:
>    $64 \text{ bits} \div 16 \text{ bits per digit} = 4 \text{ passes}$
>
> b) With a radix of $2^4$, we group 4 bits together. The number of passes required is:
>    $64 \text{ bits} \div 4 \text{ bits per digit} = 16 \text{ passes}$
>
> **Step 2: Calculate the time complexity using the formula $\Theta(b/r * (n + 2^r))$.**
> a) For a radix of $2^{16}$:
>    $\Theta(64/16 * (1,000,000 + 2^{16}))$
>    $= \Theta(4 * 1,065,536)$
>    $= \Theta(4,262,144)$
>
> b) For a radix of $2^4$:
>    $\Theta(64/4 * (1,000,000 + 2^4))$
>    $= \Theta(16 * 1,000,016)$
>    $= \Theta(16,000,256)$
>
> Therefore, the Radix Sort time complexity will be:
> a) $\Theta(4,262,144)$ with a radix of $2^{16}$
> b) $\Theta(16,000,256)$ with a radix of $2^4$
>
> As you can see, using a larger radix ($2^{16}$) results in fewer passes and a lower time complexity compared to using a smaller radix ($2^4$). In this example, treating the 64-bit numbers as four-digit numbers with a radix of $2^{16}$ is more efficient than treating them as sixteen-digit numbers with a radix of $2^4$.

> The choice of radix is an important factor in optimizing the performance of Radix Sort. A larger radix leads to fewer passes, but it also increases the space complexity and the time required for each pass. The optimal radix depends on the specific problem, the hardware, and the implementation details.
