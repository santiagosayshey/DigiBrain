> [!idea] Paths and Cycles

> - A path in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a sequence of nodes $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$ such that there exists an edge $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$ for each consecutive pair of vertices in the sequence.
>   - In other words, a path is a sequence of vertices where each consecutive pair of vertices is connected by an edge in the graph.
>   - The length of a path is the number of edges traversed in the path.
>
> - A cycle is a path where the starting and ending nodes are the same, i.e., $v_1 = v_k$.
>   - In a cycle, the first and last vertices are the same, and there are no repeated edges or vertices in between.
>   - The length of a cycle is the number of edges (or vertices) in the cycle.

If the algorithm encounters a situation where no vertex has an outdegree of zero, it implies the presence of a cycle in the graph.
