> 1. Complexity of algorithm is a function of it's input size $n$.
> 2. Complexity is machine independent
> 3. Complexity measures basic computer steps
> 4. Complexity encompasses both time & space
> 5. Complexity measures best, average and worst cases

When figuring out the complexity of a given algorithm, we must follow some rules:

| **Rule**                            | **Example**                           | **Explanation**                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ignore Constants                    | ${5n} \rightarrow O(n)$               | Ignore the 5                                             |
| Only worry about highest order term | $3n^3+5n^2+10n+20 \rightarrow O(n^3)$ | $n^3$ is the highest order, so we ignore everything else |
The following picture describes effectiveness of the most common complexities.
