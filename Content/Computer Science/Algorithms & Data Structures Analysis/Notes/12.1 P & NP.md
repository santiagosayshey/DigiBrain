> [!motivation] Importance of Efficient Algorithms
> As computational problems grow in size and complexity, the **need for efficient algorithms becomes increasingly crucial**. Inefficient algorithms can lead to impractical running times and resource usage, making certain problems infeasible to solve. By understanding the efficiency of algorithms, we can make **informed decisions about which algorithms to use for specific problems, ensuring that we can obtain solutions in a reasonable amount of time** and with acceptable resource consumption.

> [!idea] P and NP Classes
> - P (Polynomial) is the class of decision problems that can be **solved in polynomial time**.
> 	- Shortest path
> 	- Maximum flow
> 	- Linear programming.
> - NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial) is the class of decision problems for which a solution can be **verified in polynomial time**.
> 	-  Traveling salesman
> 	- Boolean satisfiability
> 	- Graph coloring.
> - All problems in P are also in NP, but it is unknown whether P = NP or P ≠ NP.

> [!example] Algorithm with O(n!) Time Complexity
> One example of an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n!) is the brute-force approach to solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP asks to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city, given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities.

> [!example] Verifying a Solution to the TSP
> Suppose we have a proposed solution to an instance of the TSP, which is a permutation of the cities representing the order in which they are visited. We can verify whether this proposed solution is valid and calculate its total distance in polynomial time.

> In this verification algorithm, we first check if the proposed path is a valid permutation of the cities. If not, we return False. If it is a valid permutation, we calculate the total distance by summing the distances between consecutive cities in the proposed path and adding the distance from the last city back to the starting city.
> 
> The time complexity of this verification algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of cities, as we iterate through the permutation once to calculate the total distance. This is a polynomial-time operation.

> [!consider] Implications of P vs. NP
> - If P = NP, many difficult problems could be solved efficiently, revolutionizing fields such as cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.
> - If P ≠ NP, it would mean that there are problems in NP that cannot be solved efficiently, and approximation algorithms or heuristics would be necessary for such problems.
> - The P vs. NP problem is one of the most important open questions in computer science and has significant implications for the field and beyond.
