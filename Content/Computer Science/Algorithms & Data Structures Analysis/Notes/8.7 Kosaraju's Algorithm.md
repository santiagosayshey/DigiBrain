> [!consider] Challenges of Finding SCCs in Directed Graphs
> 
> In **directed graphs**, identifying strongly **connected components (SCCs) is complex** due to the unidirectional nature of edges. Methods like Breadth First Search (BFS), suitable for undirected graphs, fail here because they do not consider edge directionality, leading to potential misidentification of SCCs. BFS assumes mutual connectivity, which is not guaranteed in **directed scenarios where a path from A to B doesn't imply a path from B to A**.

> 
> Kosaraju’s algorithm utilises a two-pass DFS process to find SCCs in directed graphs:
>
> 1. **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**:
>    - **Purpose**: To determine the traversal finish order of nodes based on their exploration depth. This ordering helps in prioritizing nodes for the next DFS pass.
>    - **Process**: Start a DFS from any unvisited node and explore as deep as possible. Record when you finish exploring each node (when it's added to the visited list and all possible explorations are complete).
>
> 2. **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**:
>    - **Preparation**: Before this pass, reverse the direction of every edge in the graph. For example, if there is a directed edge from A to B in the original graph, it would be reversed to B to A. This reversal is key to identifying the SCCs.
>    - **Purpose**: To discover groups of nodes that are mutually reachable under the reversed edge conditions.
>    - **Process**: Using the finish order from DFS-1 (starting with the node that finished last), conduct another DFS. The set of nodes you visit before you can no longer traverse further forms one SCC. Once an SCC is fully traversed, move to the next highest node in the finish order that has not yet been visited, and repeat the process.
>
> This method ensures mutual reachability within SCCs, both in the original and the reversed graph orientations, by leveraging the finish order to guide efficient exploration.


> [!example] Using Kosaraju’s Algorithm to Identify SCCs in Directed Graphs
>
> **Depth First Search (DFS)** is crucial for identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) in directed graphs. The process involves two passes:
>
> - **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**: Begins from any unvisited node, exploring as deeply as possible and recording the order of completion.
> - **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**: After reversing the graph’s edges, performs DFS from the node with the highest finish order, identifying SCCs with each traversal.
>
> **Example**: Consider a directed graph with nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H with the following edges:

>
> - **First Pass**:
>   - Start DFS at A, exploring A → B → C, then back to A, marking this entire loop as visited.
>   - Move to the next unvisited node, D, exploring D → E and back to D.
>   - Finally, start at F, exploring F → G → H and back to F.

> - **Reversal**:
>   - Reverse all edges: A → C becomes C → A, B → A becomes A → B, and so on.

>
> - **Second Pass**:
>   - Begin DFS at the node that finished last in the first pass - H. The traversal covers H, G and F, identifying them as part of one SCC.
>   - Next, begin at E, covering E and D, marking these as another SCC.
>   - Finally, start at A (or any of the last remaining highest finished nodes), covering A, B, and C, confirming these as the third SCC.

> [!idea] Complexity of Kosaraju’s Algorithm
>
> Kosaraju's Algorithm for identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) in directed graphs operates with a time complexity of $O(V+E)$, where $V$ represents the number of vertices and $E$ represents the number of edges. This linear complexity is due to its two-pass DFS process:
>
> - **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**: Visits each vertex and edge once to determine the nodes' finish order.
> - **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**: After reversing all edges, another DFS is conducted from the node that finished last, effectively identifying SCCs.
>
> Each edge and vertex are processed only once per pass, ensuring the algorithm's operations stay within $O(V+E)$, making it suitable for large graphs.


> [!example] Impact of SCCs in Google's PageRank Algorithm
>
> One of the most impactful applications of strongly connected components has been in the development of Google's PageRank algorithm. Initially, PageRank helped revolutionize web searches by using the link structure of the web as an indicator of an individual page's quality. Here’s how SCCs contributed:
>
> - **Understanding Web Structure**: Google’s crawler uses concepts similar to SCCs to understand the clustering of web pages. By identifying SCCs within the vast network of web pages, PageRank could better assess the importance of a page based on the cluster's characteristics, such as size and connectivity.
> - **Enhancing Search Relevance**: By analyzing the SCCs, PageRank could differentiate between sets of highly interconnected pages (like link farms) and genuinely authoritative pages, improving the relevance of search results.
>
> The ability to map and evaluate the web's network structure through SCCs allowed Google to deliver more accurate, contextually relevant search results, fundamentally shifting the dynamics of search engine technology.
