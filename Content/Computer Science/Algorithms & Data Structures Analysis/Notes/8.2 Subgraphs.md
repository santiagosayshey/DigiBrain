> A **subgraph** is a graph that is contained within another graph. More formally:
> 
> - A graph $G'=(V',E')$ is a **subgraph** of $G=(V,E)$ if $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.
>   - In other words, the nodes and edges of $G'$ are subsets of the nodes and edges of $G$.
> 
> - Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset of nodes $V' \subseteq V$, the **induced subgraph** $G'=(V',E')$ is defined as:
>   - $V' \subseteq V$
>   - $E' = \{(u,v) \in E \mid u,v \in V'\}$
>   - The induced subgraph contains all the nodes in $V'$ and all the edges from $E$ that connect nodes in $V'$.
> 
> Subgraphs are useful for focusing on specific parts or regions of a larger graph. By extracting a subgraph, we can analyze or process a smaller portion of the graph that is relevant to a particular problem or question.
