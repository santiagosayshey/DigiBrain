> - A **tree** is a connected undirected graph with no cycles.
>   - In a tree, there exists **a unique path between any pair of nodes**.
>   - A tree with \( n \) vertices has exactly \( n-1 \) edges.
>   - A tree is acyclic ( it has no cycles )
>
> - A **forest** is a **collection of zero or more disjoint trees**.
>   - A forest is an undirected graph where each subgraph is a tree. Each tree in the forest is independent and not connected to any other trees in the forest.
>   - In a forest, a unique path exists between nodes only if they belong to the same tree. There is no path connecting nodes in different trees.
>   - Like individual trees, a forest has no cycles and may consist of one or several disconnected trees.
