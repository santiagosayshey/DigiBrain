## Abstract Classes
- Use pure virtual functions.
- Sometimes we have a concept that is too general to be instantiated but is useful to be derived.
- Example: The concept of a shape. All shapes have an area, but what is the default formula for the area of a shape?
- An abstract class is a way to generalize concepts from which more specific classes can be derived.
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated because one or more of its functions don't have a sensible default implementation.

### Why?
- Some general concepts are still needed in the object hierarchy to capture commonalities.
- All shapes have a center point and a function to calculate their area.
- It can be used to create pointer abstract classes, as we saw with polymorphism.

### Remember:
- An object has state and behaviour.
- Objects with common behaviour or state are grouped into an inheritance hierarchy.
- But what's with objects that have only common functionality and no common meaning of state?

## Common Functionality
- Common functionality without common state can happen when entities are the implementation of a protocol.
- Their only common part is the functionality captured in the protocol.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Point
{
    double x;
    double y;
};

class Shape
{
    protected:
        Point centre;
    public:
        Shape(double x, double y)
        {
            this->centre.x = x;
            this->centre.y = y;
        }

        Shape() : Shape(0, 0) {}
        virtual double get_area() = 0; // pure virtual function
};

class Square : public Shape
{
    private:
        double side;
    public:
        Square(double x, double y, double side) : Shape(x, y), side(side) {}
        Square() : Shape(), side(0) {}
       
        double get_area()
        {
            return side*side;
        }
};

class Circle : public Shape
{
    private:
        double radius;
    public:
        Circle(double x, double y, double radius) : Shape(x, x), radius(radius) {}
        Circle() : Shape(), radius(0) {}
       
        double get_area()
        {
            return 3.14 * radius * radius;
        }
};

void test(Shape* shape)
{
    cout << "The area is: " << shape->get_area() << endl;
}

int main()
{
    Shape* s;
    s = new Square(10, 10, 5);

    Shape* d;
    d = new Circle(10, 10, 10);

    test(d);
    test(s);

    return 0;
}
```

## Interfaces in OOP
- Use pure abstract classes to implement interfaces in C++.
- An interface is an OOP construct that is used to capture the idea of only common functionality.
- Interfaces do not exist specifically in C++. They are abstract classes that have pure virtual functions.

```cpp
class Printable
{
    public:
        virtual void print() = 0; // this is a pure abstract class because it has no data members
};
```

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the code, use these commands:
```
g++ main.cpp -o main.out
./main.out
```
Output:
```
The area is: 314
The area is: 25
```
