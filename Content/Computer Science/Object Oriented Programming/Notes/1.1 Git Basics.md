## Git Basics

```
git init
```

- Creates a local repository in the current folder
- This repository is called a **working copy**

```
git add -A
```

- Stages a file to be included in the next revision
- “-A” means **add all**

```
git commit -m "enter commit message here"
```

- Saves the current revision of staged files

```
git rm file.c
git mv file.c
```

- `git rm` removes a file and stages its deletion
- `git mv` moves a file and stages its move

---

## Git Merging and Branching

```
git branch "name of branch"  
git checkout “name of branch”  
git merge
```

- `branch` creates a new branch from the main codebase
- `checkout` navigates to said branch
- `merge` changes the main codebase to reflect the branch you are working on

> A branch is an independent line of development within the same repository. It’s like making a copy of a document and working on the copy instead of the original  
> The main / master branch is the default branch in a repository. Created automatically when initializing a repository  
> The **HEAD** of a branch is the most recent commit of that branch  
> Merging refers to combining two branches into a singular branch  
> Conflicts can arise when merging, in which cases, the merge will be needed to be made manually.  
> You can stash a branch if you wish to work on a different branch and want to come back later

```
git checkout -b new_feature
```

- This shortcut creates a new branch and navigates to it

```
git branch -d new_feature
```

- `-d` deletes a branch
- You cannot delete a branch you are currently working in, you must navigate to the master branch first

```
git stash
```

- `stash` will save your current branch but not commit it so that you can switch to a different branch
- Stashing should only be used if absolutely necessary because it can get very confusing with multiple stashes

## Git Remote Repositories and GitHub

```
git clone
```

- Fetches a working copy of a remote repository
- The name of the default remote for a cloned repository is **origin**

```
git push
```

- Updates the remote repository with your working copy

```
git pull
```

- Fetches the latest changes from the remote and merges them into your working copy
