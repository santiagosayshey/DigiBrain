## Problem Solving with OOP

### When building a small program in OOP
1. Start by writing a detailed description of the problem
2. Identify nouns as potential classes and their data members
3. Identify verbs as interactions between the objects of the classes
4. Identify the hierarchical relationships between the classes
5. Identify the responsibilities for each class (who does what)
6. Write the code
7. Repeat the above steps to refine and refactor the code

### When building complex programs in OOP
- Modelling becomes important
- There are different modelling languages used for software development
  - Unified Modelling Language (UML)
  - Systems Modelling Language (SysML)
  - Object Process Methodology (OPM)
  - Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN)
  - Etc

## Unified Modelling Language

- UML is a graphical language for modelling computer programs
- Modelling means to create a simplified representation of something, like a house blueprint
- UML provides a way to visualise the higher level organisation of programs without getting down into the details of the actual code
- UML is intended to provide a standard way to visualise the design of a system
- Consists of different types of diagrams:
  - Structural diagrams - depict the structure of a system
    - Class diagrams (we will focus on this)
    - Object diagrams
    - Component diagram
    - Composite structure diagram
    - Deployment diagram
    - Package diagram
    - Profile diagram
  - Behavioural diagrams - describe the system’s behaviour, its users, and its building components
    - Activity diagram
    - Use case diagram (we will focus on this)
    - Interaction overview diagram
    - Timing diagram
    - State machine diagram
    - Communication diagram
    - Sequence diagram

### Ways to Build Diagrams
- **Forward Design**
  - The diagrams are created before coding begins. This is done to get a better view of the system or workflow.
- **Backward Design**
  - The diagrams are created after the code was written. The UML diagrams are drawn as documentation for the different activities, roles, actors, and workflows

### Why Do We Need Modelling?
- In a large computer program, it's hard to understand how parts of the program relate to each other simply by looking at the code.

## Class Diagram
- The most common diagram in OOP
- Class diagrams contain classes and their attributes (Data members) and behaviours (member functions)
- Each class has three fields:
  1. The class name
  2. The attributes
  3. The functions

## Relations between Classes in Class Diagrams
- **Association**
  - Is a broad term that encompasses just about any logical connection or relationship between classes
- **Aggregation**
  - Used when a collection of one class makes up part of another class with weak lifecycle dependency
- **Composition**
  - Used when one class is part of another with strong lifecycle dependency
- **Inheritance**
  - Used when one class is a child of another class
- And many more…

## Use Case Diagram
- Used to analyse the system's high-level requirements
- Expressed through different use cases
- Functional requirements can be represented as use cases
- Use Actors
  - Interact with the system
  - Can be human, organisation or internal/external application

### Example:
- A use case is a specific task, usually indicated by an actor. It describes a single goal the actor wants to attain. For example, ordering a book by the manager. The simplest version of a use case description is a paragraph or two of text.

## From Use Cases to Classes
- After the actors and use cases have been identified, the development process moves to the code construction phase.
- One approach is to look at the nouns and verbs in the use case description as candidates for classes, attributes, and relations.
- The next step is a class diagram to show classes and their relationships.
- Then other diagrams flow from this point.
