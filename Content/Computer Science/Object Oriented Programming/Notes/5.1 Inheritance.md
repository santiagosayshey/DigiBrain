## Inheritance Basics

Process by which a new class (known as derived, sub or child class), is created from another class (known as base, super or parent class).
A derived class has all the variables and functions from its base class but can have unique variables and functions too.

```cpp
class A {
    public:
        int a;
        void set_a(int a) {
            this->a = a;
        }
        int get_a() const {
            return a;
        }
    private:
};

// class B â€˜inheritsâ€™ class A
class B : public A {
    private:
        double x;
    public:
        void set_x(double x) {
            this->x = x;
        }
        double foo() {
            return x * a;
        }
};

int main() {
    B b;
    b.set_a(1);
    b.set_x(10.5);
    
    cout << b.foo() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Advantages of Inheritance

- Reuse the methods and data of existing classes
- Extend existing classes by adding new data and methods
- Modify existing classes by reimplementing its methods (change old functions)

## Base Class Access Control

If a derived class inherits a base class, private data and functions members are hidden to the derived class. They can only be accessed using a public function.
To get around this, use the `protected` class instead of the `private` class. This means the derived class can access private members without having to use a function. Functions are still needed outside of the class to access private members.

## Multiple Inheritance

- A class can inherit from more than 1 class
- A class can inherit from another class which was also inherited from another class

```cpp
class publication {
    protected:
        string title;
        string author;
        int year;
    public:
        publication(string title, string author, int year): title(title), author(author), year(year) {}
        publication(): publication("No Title", "No Author", 0) {}
        void print() {
            cout << "Title: " << this->title << endl;
            cout << "Author: " << this->author << endl;
            cout << "Year: " << this->year << endl;
        }
};

class book: public publication {
    private:
        string publisher;
        int num_pages;
        int ISBN;
    public:
        book(string title, string author, int year, string publisher, int pages, int ISBN)
        : publication(title, author, year), num_pages(pages), ISBN(ISBN), publisher(publisher) {}
        
        book(): book("No Title", "No Author", 0, "", 0, 0) {}
        
        // we can 'modify' existing functions
        void print() {
            publication::print();
            cout << "publisher: " << this->publisher << endl;
            cout << "num_pages: " << this->num_pages << endl;
            cout << "ISBN: " << this->ISBN << endl;
        }
        
        // or we can overload them by changing the parameters (called changing the signature)
        void print(bool short_print) {
            if (short_print) {
                publication::print();
            }
            else {
                publication::print();
                cout << "publisher: " << this->publisher << endl;
                cout << "num_pages: " << this->num_pages << endl;
                cout << "ISBN: " << this->ISBN << endl;
            }
        }
};

int main() {
    book b("OOP", "Sam", 2022, "Adl UNI", 500, 12332);
    b.print(true);
    return 0;
}
