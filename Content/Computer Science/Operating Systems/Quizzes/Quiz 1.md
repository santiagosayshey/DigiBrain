| 1   | When a process attempts to read from disk, and has to wait for the I/O transfer to complete, what state does it go into? | Blocked                                           |
| 2   | Which one of the following aspects of processes can only be implemented with specialised hardware support?               | Memory protection                                 |
| 3   | Which one of the following signals can processes not ignore or respond to?                                               | SIGKILL (Kill)                                    |
| 4   | Which of the following is shared between multiple threads of a process?                                                  | Code segment, data segment, file descriptor table |
| 5   | Which of the following statements is NOT true of threads?                                                                | All processes share the same set of threads       |
| 6   | The interval from the time of submission of a process to the time of completion is termed as:                            | Turnaround time                                   |
| 7   | Pre-emptive scheduling is the strategy of temporarily suspending a running process:                                      | before its CPU burst is completed                 |
| 8   | Which of the following factors does NOT contribute to the cost of context switching?                                     | Amount of time the process has been running       |
| 9   | Which one of the following scheduling strategies will NOT lead to starvation?                                            | First Come, First Serve (FCFS or FIFO)            |
| 10  | In Round Robin CPU scheduling as the time slice is increased the average turn around time will:                          | go up or down depending on other factors          |
