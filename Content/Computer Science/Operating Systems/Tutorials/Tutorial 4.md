Certainly. Here's a more diplomatic version of the email that addresses the concerns while maintaining a constructive tone:

```
Dear Akrita and team,

Thanks for submitting your project for peer review. I've had a chance to look over your code and documentation, and I have a few questions:

1. Setup Instructions: In the README, you mentioned compiling an encryption program. Could you clarify this step? I couldn't find any compilable files in the submission, only chat_server.py and index.html.

2. Authentication Function: I noticed the vulnerable_authentication function in your code. I couldn't see where it's being called in the main loop. Has this been finished?

3. Feature Implementation: The assignment called for several specific features like file transfers and a standardized protocol. Can you please clarify if this has been implemented or not? 

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
Samuel Chau
