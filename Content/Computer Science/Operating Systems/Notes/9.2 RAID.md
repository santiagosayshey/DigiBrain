> [!motivation] Multiple Disk Systems
> In modern computing, single disk solutions often fall short in meeting growing data storage needs:
> - **Capacity**: Large datasets require more storage space than a single disk can provide.
> - **Reliability**: Reliance on a single disk creates a single point of failure, risking data loss.
> - **Performance**: I/O operations can become a bottleneck with increasing data volumes.
> - **Scalability**: As data grows, the ability to expand storage becomes crucial.
> 
> These challenges necessitate solutions that can effectively manage multiple disks to address capacity, reliability, performance, and scalability concerns simultaneously.

> [!idea] JBOD: Just a Bunch of Disks
> JBOD is an approach to using multiple disks:
> - Can be configured to **present disks as separate volumes or a single concatenated volume.**
> - Provides increased total storage capacity.
> - No built-in data redundancy or performance improvements.
> - Disk failure impact depends on configuration:
>   - In separate volume mode: Only data on the failed disk is lost.
>   - In concatenated mode: Data loss can extend beyond the failed disk.

> [!idea] RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks
> RAID is a storage technology that **uses multiple disks to enhance data management**:
> 
> - Core Strategy:  
>   - Mapping: Presents **multiple physical disks as a single logical unit** to the operating system.
>   - Redundancy: Implements **data protection mechanisms using additional storage capacity**.
> 
> - Definition: RAID is a method of **logically combining multiple disk drive components** into one or more units for data redundancy and performance improvement.
> 
> - Key Decisions in RAID Implementation:
>   - Logical to Physical Mapping: Determining **how logical blocks are distributed across physical disks**.
>   - Redundancy Allocation: Deciding **how to use extra physical blocks for data protection**.
>   - RAID Levels: Different configurations that **balance performance, capacity, and redundancy**.
> 
> RAID systems can be tailored to prioritize various aspects of data storage, leading to different implementations suited for specific use cases.

> [!consider] RAID: From "Inexpensive" to "Independent"
> - **Original Meaning**: RAID initially stood for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks"
>   - Aimed to use multiple cheap, consumer-grade disks instead of a single expensive, high-end disk
>   - Strategy: Achieve reliability and performance through software techniques rather than hardware quality
> 
> - **Shift to "Independent"**:
>   - Modern interpretation: "Redundant Array of Independent Disks"
>   - Reasons for change:
>     - Recognition that RAID is used with various disk types, not just inexpensive ones
>     - Emphasis on the distributed nature of RAID systems
>     - Avoidance of suggesting RAID is a cost-cutting measure, as implementations can be costly
> 
> - **Implications**:
>   - RAID is now seen as a general storage strategy, applicable to various disk qualities and prices
>   - Focus has shifted from purely cost savings to emphasizing redundancy and performance benefits
>   - Acknowledges that RAID can be implemented with high-end disks for enterprise-grade solutions
