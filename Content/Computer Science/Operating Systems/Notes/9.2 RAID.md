> [!motivation] Multiple Disk Systems
> In modern computing, single disk solutions often fall short in meeting growing data storage needs:
> - **Capacity**: Large datasets require more storage space than a single disk can provide.
> - **Reliability**: Reliance on a single disk creates a single point of failure, risking data loss.
> - **Performance**: I/O operations can become a bottleneck with increasing data volumes.
> - **Scalability**: As data grows, the ability to expand storage becomes crucial.
> 
> These challenges necessitate solutions that can effectively manage multiple disks to address capacity, reliability, performance, and scalability concerns simultaneously.

> [!idea] JBOD: Just a Bunch of Disks
> JBOD is an approach to using multiple disks:
> - Can be configured to **present disks as separate volumes or a single concatenated volume.**
> - Provides increased total storage capacity.
> - No built-in data redundancy or performance improvements.
> - Disk failure impact depends on configuration:
>   - In separate volume mode: Only data on the failed disk is lost.
>   - In concatenated mode: Data loss can extend beyond the failed disk.

> [!idea] RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks
> RAID manages multiple disks to improve storage characteristics:
> - Presents **multiple physical disks as a single logical unit to the OS.**
> - Uses techniques to **balance performance, capacity, and data protection:**
>   - **Striping**: Divides data into smaller chunks across multiple disks. Improves read/write speeds by allowing parallel access.
>   - **Mirroring**: Duplicates data across two or more disks. Provides full redundancy for data protection.
>   - **Parity**: Stores calculated data that allows reconstruction of lost information. Offers redundancy with less storage overhead than mirroring.
> 
> Common RAID levels:
> - **RAID 0**: Uses striping. Improves performance, but no redundancy.
> - **RAID 1**: Uses mirroring. Full redundancy, but no capacity gain.
> - **RAID 5**: Combines striping with distributed parity. Balances redundancy, capacity, and performance.

> [!consider] RAID: From "Inexpensive" to "Independent"
> - **Original Meaning**: RAID initially stood for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks"
>   - Aimed to use multiple cheap, consumer-grade disks instead of a single expensive, high-end disk
>   - Strategy: Achieve reliability and performance through software techniques rather than hardware quality
> 
> - **Shift to "Independent"**:
>   - Modern interpretation: "Redundant Array of Independent Disks"
>   - Reasons for change:
>     - Recognition that RAID is used with various disk types, not just inexpensive ones
>     - Emphasis on the distributed nature of RAID systems
>     - Avoidance of suggesting RAID is a cost-cutting measure, as implementations can be costly
> 
> - **Implications**:
>   - RAID is now seen as a general storage strategy, applicable to various disk qualities and prices
>   - Focus has shifted from purely cost savings to emphasizing redundancy and performance benefits
>   - Acknowledges that RAID can be implemented with high-end disks for enterprise-grade solutions
