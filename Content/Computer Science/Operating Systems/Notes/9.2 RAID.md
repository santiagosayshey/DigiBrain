> [!motivation] Multiple Disk Systems
> In modern computing, single disk solutions often fall short in meeting growing data storage needs:
> - **Capacity**: Large datasets require more storage space than a single disk can provide.
> - **Reliability**: Reliance on a single disk creates a single point of failure, risking data loss.
> - **Performance**: I/O operations can become a bottleneck with increasing data volumes.
> - **Scalability**: As data grows, the ability to expand storage becomes crucial.
> 
> These challenges necessitate solutions that can effectively manage multiple disks to address capacity, reliability, performance, and scalability concerns simultaneously.

> [!idea] JBOD: Just a Bunch of Disks
> JBOD is an approach to using multiple disks:
> - Can be configured to **present disks as separate volumes or a single concatenated volume.**
> - Provides increased total storage capacity.
> - No built-in data redundancy or performance improvements.
> - Disk failure impact depends on configuration:
>   - In separate volume mode: Only data on the failed disk is lost.
>   - In concatenated mode: Data loss can extend beyond the failed disk.


> [!idea] RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks
> Core concept: RAID **presents multiple physical disks as a single logical disk to the operating system**, achieved through:
> 
> 1. Mapping: Translating between logical addresses (as seen by the OS) and physical locations on multiple disks.
> 2. Redundancy: Using extra storage capacity to protect against data loss from disk failures.
> 
> RAID implementations must decide:
> 1. How to distribute logical blocks across physical disks
> 2. How to use any extra physical blocks for data protection
> 3. How to balance performance, capacity, and reliability (RAID level)

> [!consider]- RAID: From "Inexpensive" to "Independent"
> - **Original Meaning**: RAID initially stood for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks"
>   - Aimed to use multiple cheap, consumer-grade disks instead of a single expensive, high-end disk
>   - Strategy: Achieve reliability and performance through software techniques rather than hardware quality
> 
> - **Shift to "Independent"**:
>   - Modern interpretation: "Redundant Array of Independent Disks"
>   - Reasons for change:
>     - Recognition that RAID is used with various disk types, not just inexpensive ones
>     - Emphasis on the distributed nature of RAID systems
>     - Avoidance of suggesting RAID is a cost-cutting measure, as implementations can be costly
> 
> - **Implications**:
>   - RAID is now seen as a general storage strategy, applicable to various disk qualities and prices
>   - Focus has shifted from purely cost savings to emphasizing redundancy and performance benefits
>   - Acknowledges that RAID can be implemented with high-end disks for enterprise-grade solutions

> [!consider] RAID Performance Factors
> When evaluating RAID systems, consider these key aspects of read/write operations and performance metrics:
> 
> **Read/Write Operations**:
> - **Single Operation**: Performance of an individual read or write request.
> - **Steady State**: System behavior under continuous, consistent workload.
> - **Sequential Access**: Reading or writing contiguous blocks of data.
> - **Random Access**: Reading or writing non-contiguous, scattered data blocks.
> 
> **Performance Metrics**:
> - **Capacity**: Total usable storage space available to the system.
> - **Reliability**: 
>   - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): Average time between system failures.
>   - Mean Time To Data Loss (MTTDL): Expected time until data loss occurs.
> - **Performance**:
>   - Throughput: Amount of data processed per unit of time.
>   - IOPS: Number of input/output operations completed per second.
>   - Latency: Time taken to complete a single I/O request.
> 
> These factors help in assessing RAID configurations for specific use cases and requirements.
