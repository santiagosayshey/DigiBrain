> [!motivation] Multiple Disk Systems
> In modern computing, single disk solutions often fall short in meeting growing data storage needs:
> - **Capacity**: Large datasets require more storage space than a single disk can provide.
> - **Reliability**: Reliance on a single disk creates a single point of failure, risking data loss.
> - **Performance**: I/O operations can become a bottleneck with increasing data volumes.
> - **Scalability**: As data grows, the ability to expand storage becomes crucial.
> 
> These challenges necessitate solutions that can effectively manage multiple disks to address capacity, reliability, performance, and scalability concerns simultaneously.

> [!idea] JBOD: Just a Bunch of Disks
> JBOD is a simple approach to using multiple disks:
> - Combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit.
> - Each disk operates independently.
> - Provides increased storage capacity.
> - Lacks built-in redundancy or performance improvements.

> [!idea] RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks
> RAID is a more sophisticated multi-disk solution:
> - Combines multiple disks into a single logical unit.
> - Offers various configurations (levels) for different needs.
> - Key benefits:
>   - Increased storage capacity
>   - Improved data reliability through redundancy
>   - Enhanced performance for certain operations
> 
> | RAID Level | Description | Key Advantage |
> |------------|-------------|----------------|
> | RAID 0     | Striping    | Performance    |
> | RAID 1     | Mirroring   | Redundancy     |
> | RAID 5     | Striping with distributed parity | Balance of performance and redundancy |

> [!consider] JBOD vs RAID
> When choosing between JBOD and RAID:
> - **JBOD**: 
>   - Simpler to implement
>   - Useful for non-critical data storage
>   - No performance improvement or data protection
> - **RAID**:
>   - More complex, but offers greater benefits
>   - Suitable for critical data and high-performance needs
>   - Requires careful planning and management
