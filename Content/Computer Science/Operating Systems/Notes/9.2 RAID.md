> [!motivation] Multiple Disk Systems
> In modern computing, single disk solutions often fall short in meeting growing data storage needs:
> - **Capacity**: Large datasets require more storage space than a single disk can provide.
> - **Reliability**: Reliance on a single disk creates a single point of failure, risking data loss.
> - **Performance**: I/O operations can become a bottleneck with increasing data volumes.
> - **Scalability**: As data grows, the ability to expand storage becomes crucial.
> 
> These challenges necessitate solutions that can effectively manage multiple disks to address capacity, reliability, performance, and scalability concerns simultaneously.

> [!idea] JBOD: Just a Bunch of Disks
> JBOD is an approach to using multiple disks:
> - Can be configured to **present disks as separate volumes or a single concatenated volume.**
> - Provides increased total storage capacity.
> - No built-in data redundancy or performance improvements.
> - Disk failure impact depends on configuration:
>   - In separate volume mode: Only data on the failed disk is lost.
>   - In concatenated mode: Data loss can extend beyond the failed disk.

> [!idea] RAID: Redundant Array of Independent Disks
> RAID is a storage technology that **uses multiple disks to enhance data management**:
> 
> - Core Strategy:  
>   - Mapping: Presents multiple physical disks as a single logical unit to the operating system.
>   - Redundancy: Implements **data protection mechanisms** using additional storage capacity.
> 
> - Definition: RAID is a method of logically combining multiple disk drive components into one or more units for **data redundancy and performance improvement**.
> 
> - Key Decisions in RAID Implementation:
>   - Logical to Physical Mapping: Determining how logical blocks are distributed across physical disks.
>   - Redundancy Allocation: Deciding how to use extra physical blocks for data protection.
>   - RAID Levels: Different configurations that **balance performance, capacity, and redundancy**.
> 
> RAID systems can be tailored to prioritize various aspects of data storage, leading to different implementations suited for specific use cases.

> [!consider] RAID: From "Inexpensive" to "Independent"
> - **Original Meaning**: RAID initially stood for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks"
>   - Aimed to use multiple cheap, consumer-grade disks instead of a single expensive, high-end disk
>   - Strategy: Achieve reliability and performance through software techniques rather than hardware quality
> 
> - **Shift to "Independent"**:
>   - Modern interpretation: "Redundant Array of Independent Disks"
>   - Reasons for change:
>     - Recognition that RAID is used with various disk types, not just inexpensive ones
>     - Emphasis on the distributed nature of RAID systems
>     - Avoidance of suggesting RAID is a cost-cutting measure, as implementations can be costly
> 
> - **Implications**:
>   - RAID is now seen as a general storage strategy, applicable to various disk qualities and prices
>   - Focus has shifted from purely cost savings to emphasizing redundancy and performance benefits
>   - Acknowledges that RAID can be implemented with high-end disks for enterprise-grade solutions

> [!consider] RAID Performance Factors
> When evaluating RAID systems, consider these key aspects of read/write operations and performance metrics:
> 
> **Read/Write Operations**:
> - **Single Operation**: Performance of an individual read or write request.
> - **Steady State**: System behavior under continuous, consistent workload.
> - **Sequential Access**: Reading or writing contiguous blocks of data.
> - **Random Access**: Reading or writing non-contiguous, scattered data blocks.
> 
> **Performance Metrics**:
> - **Capacity**: Total usable storage space available to the system.
> - **Reliability**: 
>   - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): Average time between system failures.
>   - Mean Time To Data Loss (MTTDL): Expected time until data loss occurs.
> - **Performance**:
>   - Throughput: Amount of data processed per unit of time.
>   - IOPS: Number of input/output operations completed per second.
>   - Latency: Time taken to complete a single I/O request.
> 
> These factors help in assessing RAID configurations for specific use cases and requirements.

> [!idea] RAID 0: Striping
> RAID 0 uses striping to **optimize for capacity and performance**, with no redundancy:
> 
> - **Striping**: The process of **dividing data into smaller units (strips) and distributing them across multiple disks**.
>   - Each strip is typically a fixed size (e.g., 64KB or 128KB)
>   - Allows parallel read/write operations, potentially improving performance
> 
> - **Goal**: Maximize usable capacity and improve performance
> 
> - **No Redundancy**: 
>   - All available storage is used for data (no space used for redundancy)
>   - Failure of any disk results in complete data loss
>   - **Less reliable than JBOD**, as failure of any disk affects all data
> 
> **Physical to Logical Block Mapping**:
> - Logical blocks are mapped to physical blocks in alternating sequence across disks

> This diagram shows how logical blocks are striped across two physical disks in a RAID 0 configuration.

> [!example] RAID 0 in Action
> Consider a RAID 0 setup with two 1TB disks:
> 
> - **Total Capacity**: 2TB (1TB + 1TB)
> - **Usable Capacity**: 2TB (100% of total capacity)
> - **Striping**: Assuming a 64KB strip size
> 
> **Scenario**: Writing a 256KB file
> 
> 1. The file is divided into four 64KB strips
> 2. Strips are written in parallel:
>    - Strip 1 & 3 to Disk 1
>    - Strip 2 & 4 to Disk 2
> 
> **Performance Impact**:
> - **Read/Write Speed**: Potentially doubled, as both disks operate simultaneously
> - **Theoretical Max Throughput**: Sum of individual disk throughputs
> 
> **Reliability Consideration**:
> - If either disk fails, the entire 256KB file is lost, along with all other data in the array
