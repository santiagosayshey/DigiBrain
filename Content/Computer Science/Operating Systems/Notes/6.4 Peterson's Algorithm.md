> [!motivation] The Problem with Simple Flag-Based Locks
> **Simple flag-based locks can suffer from race conditions** when multiple threads attempt to enter a critical section simultaneously. This occurs because:
> - Reading and setting the flag may not be atomic operations
> - Changes to the flag might not be immediately visible to all threads
> - There's no guaranteed fairness in lock acquisition
You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the oversight. Let's revise both the idea and example callouts to incorporate this key information more clearly:

> [!idea] Peterson's Algorithm
> Peterson's algorithm is a software-based solution for **mutual exclusion between two threads**, addressing the shortcomings of simple flag-based locks.
> 
> **Key components:**
> - Two flag variables (`flag[0]` and `flag[1]`), one for each thread
> - A turn variable to indicate which thread should yield if there's contention
> 
> **How it works:**
> 1. A thread sets its own flag to indicate interest in entering the critical section
> 2. It then sets the turn to the **other** thread's id, effectively giving up priority
> 3. The thread waits if the other thread is interested (flag is true) **and** it's the other thread's turn
> 
> ```c
> // Pseudocode for Thread i (where i is 0 or 1)
> flag[i] = true;
> turn = 1 - i;  // Set turn to the other thread
> while (flag[1-i] == true && turn == 1-i) {
>     // Wait
> }
> // Enter critical section
> ```
> 
> **Key insight:** Setting the turn to the other thread's id is crucial for fairness and preventing monopoly.

> [!example] Peterson's Algorithm in Action
> Consider two threads, A and B, trying to enter a critical section:
> 
> 1. Thread A sets `flag[A] = true` and `turn = B`
> 2. Thread B sets `flag[B] = true` and `turn = A`
> 3. Both threads check the while condition:
>    - A sees `flag[B] == true` but `turn == A`, so it enters (B gave it priority)
>    - B sees `flag[A] == true` and `turn == A`, so it waits (it gave A priority)
> 4. Thread A completes and sets `flag[A] = false`
> 5. Thread B can now enter the critical section
> 
> ```

> [!motivation] The Need for Memory Barriers in Lock Implementation
> In modern computer architectures, **memory operations can be reordered** by processors and compilers for performance optimization. This reordering can lead to unexpected behaviors in concurrent programs, especially in lock implementations:
> 
> **Problems without memory barriers:**
> - **Visibility issues:** Changes made by one thread might not be immediately visible to other threads due to CPU caching.
> - **Instruction reordering:** The processor or compiler might reorder memory operations, breaking the intended logic of a lock.
> 
> **Example scenario:**
> ```c
> // Without memory barriers
> flag = true;  // Indicate lock acquisition
> // Critical section
> data = new_value;  // Update shared data
> flag = false;  // Release lock
> ```
> 
> In this scenario:
> 1. The update to `data` might be reordered before setting `flag = true`
> 2. Other threads might see `flag = false` before the update to `data` is visible
> 3. This can lead to race conditions and data inconsistency
> 
> Memory barriers provide a way to enforce the required ordering and visibility, ensuring that lock operations work correctly across different threads and processors.

> [!idea] Memory Barrier Instructions
> Memory barrier instructions, also known as memory fences, are **low-level synchronization primitives** used to enforce ordering in memory operations across multiple threads or processors, addressing the issues highlighted in the motivation.
> 
> **Key points:**
> - Ensures visibility of memory operations across threads
> - Prevents reordering of memory accesses by the processor or compiler
> - Critical for implementing synchronization algorithms correctly
> 
> **Types of memory barriers:**
> - Full barrier: Ensures all memory operations before the barrier complete before any after it
> - Load barrier: Ensures all loads before the barrier complete before loads after it
> - Store barrier: Ensures all stores before the barrier complete before stores after it
> 
> **Usage in lock implementation:**
> ```c
> // Example usage in a simple lock
> memory_barrier();  // Ensure all previous operations are visible
> flag = true;  // Acquire lock
> memory_barrier();  // Ensure lock acquisition is visible before entering critical section
> // Critical section
> memory_barrier();  // Ensure all critical section operations complete
> flag = false;  // Release lock
> memory_barrier();  // Ensure lock release is immediately visible to other threads
> ```
> 
> **Importance:**
> - Prevents race conditions and ensures correct behavior of locks
> - Essential for implementing lock-free algorithms and ensuring correctness of synchronization primitives
> - Provides guarantees needed for algorithms like Peterson's to work correctly on modern hardware
