> [!motivation] The Need for Process Management
> In modern computing environments, **multiple programs often need to run concurrently on a single processor**. For example:
> - A user might be browsing the web while a background application checks for updates
> - An operating system needs to manage various system tasks while running user applications
> - A server must handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously
> 
> This creates a challenge: **How can a single processor efficiently handle multiple tasks**, giving each the illusion of continuous execution? 
> 
> While multi-core processors can run truly parallel tasks, even these systems often have **more active processes than available cores**. This necessitates a system for managing which code runs when, and for how long.

> [!idea] Dispatching: The Role of the Dispatcher
> Dispatching involves the **mechanism of transferring control of the CPU to the process selected by the scheduler**. It entails:
> 
> - **Switching context**: Saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the next process
> - **Switching to user mode**: Setting the CPU mode to user mode for executing user processes
> - **Jumping to the proper location**: Transferring control to the instruction where the process left off

> [!consider] Problems with Dispatching
> **How does the dispatcher gain control?**
> There are two main approaches:
> 
> 1. **Cooperative Multitasking**: Processes voluntarily yield control
> 2. **True Multitasking**: OS uses interrupts to preemptively take control
> 
> | Aspect | Cooperative Multitasking | True Multitasking |
> |--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
> | Mechanism | Processes call yield() or make blocking system calls | Hardware interrupts (timer, I/O) and software interrupts (system calls, exceptions) |
> | Strengths | - Simple implementation<br>- Low overhead<br>- Predictable switching points | - Better responsiveness<br>- Fairer CPU allocation<br>- Can handle misbehaving processes |
> | Weaknesses | - Vulnerable to poorly designed processes<br>- Poor responsiveness<br>- One process can monopolize CPU | - Higher overhead<br>- More complex implementation<br>- Potential for race conditions |
> 
> **What must be saved and restored?**
> - CPU registers (Program Counter, Stack Pointer, general-purpose registers)
> - Process state information
> - Memory management data
> - I/O status
> 
> **Problem of Slow I/O:**
> The OS solves this by:
> - Tracking process states (running, ready, blocked) via Process IDs
> - Maintaining a queue of ready processes and event processes
> - Switching to ready processes when the current process becomes blocked on I/O
> - Moving processes from blocked to ready state when I/O completes
> This approach ensures efficient CPU utilization despite slow I/O operations.

> [!example] Dispatch in Action
> Consider two processes: A (text editor) and B (web browser)
> 
> 1. Process A is running
> 2. Dispatcher decides to switch to B
> 3. Dispatcher **saves A's state** (registers, program counter, etc.)
> 4. Dispatcher **loads B's previously saved state**
> 5. Execution resumes with Process B
> 
> This happens many times per second, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.
