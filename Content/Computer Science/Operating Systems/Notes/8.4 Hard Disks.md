> [!motivation] Persistence in Computing
> In computing, we **need a way to store data permanently**, even when power is cut off. While memory like RAM is fast, it's volatile and loses data without power. This creates a need for a storage solution that can:
> - Retain data long-term without continuous power
> - Store large amounts of information
> - Allow for both reading and writing of data
>
> How can we conceptualize a device that meets these requirements while balancing capacity, speed, and cost?

> [!idea] Hard Disk Interface
> Hard disks provide a sector-addressable address space:
> - **Sector**: Smallest addressable unit on the disk (typically 512 bytes)
> - **Address Space**: Logical organization of sectors, each with a unique address
> 
> Basic operations:
> - Read: Retrieve data from a specific sector address
> - Write: Store data to a specific sector address
> 
> Characteristics:
> - **Mechanical nature**: Uses physical components for read/write operations
> - **Relatively slow**: Access times are in milliseconds due to mechanical movement

> [!idea] Magnetic Disk Structure
> Hard disks use magnetic storage technology:
> - **Platters**: Circular disks coated with magnetic material
> - **Read/Write Heads**: Electromagnetic devices that read and write data
> - **Tracks**: Concentric circles on platters where data is stored
> - **Sectors**: Subdivisions of tracks, smallest addressable unit
> 
> Key components:
> - Spindle: Rotates platters at high speed (e.g., 7200 RPM)
> - Actuator arm: Moves read/write heads across platters
> 
> Data access process:
> 1. Seek: Move heads to correct track
> 2. Rotational delay: Wait for sector to rotate under head
> 3. Transfer: Read or write data
