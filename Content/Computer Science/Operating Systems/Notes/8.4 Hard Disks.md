> [!motivation] Persistence in Computing
> In computing, we **need a way to store data permanently**, even when power is cut off. While memory like RAM is fast, it's volatile and loses data without power. This creates a need for a storage solution that can:
> - Retain data long-term without continuous power
> - Store large amounts of information
> - Allow for both reading and writing of data
>
> How can we conceptualize a device that meets these requirements while balancing capacity, speed, and cost?

> [!idea] Hard Disk Interface
> Hard disks provide a sector-addressable address space:
> - **Sector**: Smallest addressable unit on the disk (typically 512 bytes)
> - **Address Space**: Logical organization of sectors, each with a unique address
> 
> Basic operations:
> - Read: Retrieve data from a specific sector address
> - Write: Store data to a specific sector address
> 
> Characteristics:
> - **Mechanical nature**: Uses physical components for read/write operations
> - **Relatively slow**: Access times are in milliseconds due to mechanical movement


> [!idea] Magnetic Disk Structure
> Hard disks use magnetic storage technology:
> - **Platters**: Circular disks coated with magnetic material
> - **Read/Write Heads**: Electromagnetic devices that read and write data
> - **Tracks**: Concentric circles on platters where data is stored
> - **Sectors**: Subdivisions of tracks, smallest addressable unit
> - **Cylinders**: Vertical alignment of tracks across all platters
> 
> Key components:
> - Spindle: Rotates platters at high speed (e.g., 7200 RPM)
> - Actuator arm: Moves read/write heads across platters
> 
> Head behavior:
> - All heads move in unison, always positioned over the same cylinder
> - This design simplifies addressing and improves performance for sequential data access
> 
> Data access process:
> 1. Seek: Move heads to correct track (cylinder)
> 2. Rotational delay: Wait for sector to rotate under head
> 3. Transfer: Read or write data

> [!consider] Disk Positioning Mechanism
> Hard disks use a precise positioning system:
> - **Servo bursts**: Special magnetic patterns on disk surface
> - Function: Provide feedback for head positioning
> - Process:
>   1. Heads read servo bursts as they move
>   2. Disk controller interprets signals
>   3. Adjusts head position for accuracy
> - Advantages:
>   - Compensates for thermal expansion/contraction
>   - Ensures accurate tracking despite minor physical changes

> [!example] Navigating to Sector 12
> Process to read data from sector 12:
> 1. **Seek**: Heads move to the correct track containing sector 12
> 2. **Rotate**: Disk spins until sector 12 is under the read head
>    - Continues spinning during next step
> 3. **Transfer**: Data is read from sector 12
>    - Continues until end of sector is reached

> [!idea] Hard Disk Access Time Components
> Total access time = Seek time + Rotational delay + Transfer time
> 
> 1. **Seek time**:
>    - Function of cylinder distance
>    - Non-linear due to acceleration, coast, deceleration, and settle phases
>    - Settling alone: 0.5 - 2 ms
>    - Total seek: Often 4 - 10 ms
>    - Average seek distance ≈ 1/3 max seek distance
>
> 2. **Rotational delay**:
>    - Depends on RPM (Rotations Per Minute)
>    - For 7200 RPM: 8.3 ms per full rotation
>    - Average rotational delay: 4.15 ms (half rotation)
>
> 3. **Transfer time**:
>    - Depends on RPM and sector density
>    - Typical maximum transfer rate: 100+ MB/s
>    - For 512-byte sector: ~5 μs (microseconds)
>
> **Workload performance**:
> - Sequential access (faster): Accessing sectors in order
> - Random access (slower): Accessing sectors arbitrarily


> [!example] Calculating Throughput for Cheetah and Barracuda (Random Workload)
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20241003072858.png]]
> 
> For random workloads, we need to consider seek time, rotational delay, and transfer time for each read operation. We'll assume 16 KB random reads.
> 
> **Cheetah Calculation:**
> 1. Seek time: 4 ms (given)
> 2. Rotational delay: 
>    - Time for one rotation: (60 sec / 15,000 RPM) * 1000 ms/sec = 4 ms
>    - Average rotational delay: 4 ms / 2 = 2 ms
> 3. Transfer time: 
>    - (16 KB / 125 MB/s) * 1000 ms/sec = 0.125 ms
> 4. Total time: 4 ms + 2 ms + 0.125 ms = 6.125 ms
> 5. Throughput: (16 KB / 6.125 ms) * (1 MB / 1024 KB) * (1000 ms / 1 sec) ≈ 2.5 MB/s
> 
> **Barracuda Calculation:**
> 1. Seek time: 9 ms (given)
> 2. Rotational delay:
>    - Time for one rotation: (60 sec / 7,200 RPM) * 1000 ms/sec ≈ 8.33 ms
>    - Average rotational delay: 8.33 ms / 2 ≈ 4.17 ms
> 3. Transfer time:
>    - (16 KB / 105 MB/s) * 1000 ms/sec ≈ 0.149 ms
> 4. Total time: 9 ms + 4.17 ms + 0.149 ms ≈ 13.32 ms
> 5. Throughput: (16 KB / 13.32 ms) * (1 MB / 1024 KB) * (1000 ms / 1 sec) ≈ 1.2 MB/s
> 
> **Conclusion:**
> - Cheetah's random read throughput: ~2.5 MB/s
> - Barracuda's random read throughput: ~1.2 MB/s
> 
> The Cheetah's higher RPM and shorter seek time result in significantly better performance for random read operations compared to the Barracuda.

> [!idea] Track Skew
> Track skew is a technique used to optimize sequential read performance:
> 
> - **Definition**: Offsetting the sector numbering between adjacent tracks
> - **Purpose**: To allow time for the read/write head to move to the next track
> - **How it works**:
>   - Sectors are numbered with a slight offset on each track
>   - After reading the last sector on one track, the head has time to move to the next track
>   - The first sector of the new track is positioned directly under the head
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Reduces latency in sequential reads across track boundaries
>   - Eliminates the need for a full rotation when moving to the next track
> - **Example**: If track 1 starts with sector 0, track 2 might start with sector 3
> 
> Track skew optimizes for the physical realities of disk head movement, improving overall disk performance for sequential operations.

> [!idea] Zones (Zoned Bit Recording)
> Zoned Bit Recording (ZBR) is a technique to increase disk capacity and improve performance:
> 
> - **Definition**: Grouping tracks into zones, with outer zones having more sectors per track than inner zones
> - **Rationale**: Outer tracks have a larger circumference, allowing for more data storage
> - **Key aspects**:
>   - Disk is divided into several zones
>   - Each zone has a constant number of sectors per track
>   - Outer zones have more sectors per track than inner zones
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Increases overall disk capacity
>   - Improves data transfer rates for outer zones
>   - Utilizes disk space more efficiently
> - **Implications**:
>   - Variable data transfer rates depending on which zone is being accessed
>   - Complicates disk geometry calculations and low-level formatting
> 
> ZBR allows modern hard drives to maximize storage capacity and improve performance by taking advantage of the physical properties of circular platters.

> [!idea] Disk Cache
> Disk cache, also known as disk buffer or track buffer, is a small amount of fast memory on the hard drive:
> 
> - **Purpose**: To improve disk performance by reducing mechanical delays
> - **Key features**:
>   - Typically ranges from 16 MB to 256 MB of DRAM
>   - Acts as a buffer between the disk and the computer
> - **Functionalities**:
>   1. **Read-ahead caching**:
>      - Prefetches data that is likely to be requested soon
>      - Stores entire tracks during rotational delays
>   2. **Write caching**:
>      - Temporarily stores write operations
>      - Allows for immediate reporting of write completion to the OS
>   3. **Command queuing**:
>      - Stores multiple I/O requests
>      - Allows the disk to reorder and optimize request execution
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Reduces latency for frequently accessed data
>   - Improves overall disk performance
>   - Allows for more efficient handling of I/O requests
> - **Considerations**:
>   - Write caching can lead to data loss in case of power failure
>   - Some systems allow disabling write cache for critical data integrity
> 
> Disk cache serves as an important intermediary, helping to bridge the performance gap between fast CPUs and slower mechanical disk operations.
