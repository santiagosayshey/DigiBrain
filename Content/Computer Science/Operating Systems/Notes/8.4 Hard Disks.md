> [!motivation] Persistence in Computing
> In computing, we **need a way to store data permanently**, even when power is cut off. While memory like RAM is fast, it's volatile and loses data without power. This creates a need for a storage solution that can:
> - Retain data long-term without continuous power
> - Store large amounts of information
> - Allow for both reading and writing of data
>
> How can we conceptualize a device that meets these requirements while balancing capacity, speed, and cost?

> [!idea] Hard Disk Interface
> Hard disks provide a sector-addressable address space:
> - **Sector**: Smallest addressable unit on the disk (typically 512 bytes)
> - **Address Space**: Logical organization of sectors, each with a unique address
> 
> Basic operations:
> - Read: Retrieve data from a specific sector address
> - Write: Store data to a specific sector address
> 
> Characteristics:
> - **Mechanical nature**: Uses physical components for read/write operations
> - **Relatively slow**: Access times are in milliseconds due to mechanical movement


> [!idea] Magnetic Disk Structure
> Hard disks use magnetic storage technology:
> - **Platters**: Circular disks coated with magnetic material
> - **Read/Write Heads**: Electromagnetic devices that read and write data
> - **Tracks**: Concentric circles on platters where data is stored
> - **Sectors**: Subdivisions of tracks, smallest addressable unit
> - **Cylinders**: Vertical alignment of tracks across all platters
> 
> Key components:
> - Spindle: Rotates platters at high speed (e.g., 7200 RPM)
> - Actuator arm: Moves read/write heads across platters
> 
> Head behavior:
> - All heads move in unison, always positioned over the same cylinder
> - This design simplifies addressing and improves performance for sequential data access
> 
> Data access process:
> 1. Seek: Move heads to correct track (cylinder)
> 2. Rotational delay: Wait for sector to rotate under head
> 3. Transfer: Read or write data

> [!consider] Disk Positioning Mechanism
> Hard disks use a precise positioning system:
> - **Servo bursts**: Special magnetic patterns on disk surface
> - Function: Provide feedback for head positioning
> - Process:
>   1. Heads read servo bursts as they move
>   2. Disk controller interprets signals
>   3. Adjusts head position for accuracy
> - Advantages:
>   - Compensates for thermal expansion/contraction
>   - Ensures accurate tracking despite minor physical changes

> [!example] Navigating to Sector 12
> Process to read data from sector 12:
> 1. **Seek**: Heads move to the correct track containing sector 12
> 2. **Rotate**: Disk spins until sector 12 is under the read head
>    - Continues spinning during next step
> 3. **Transfer**: Data is read from sector 12
>    - Continues until end of sector is reached

> [!idea] Hard Disk Access Time Components
> Total access time = Seek time + Rotational delay + Transfer time
> 
> 1. **Seek time**:
>    - Function of cylinder distance
>    - Non-linear due to acceleration, coast, deceleration, and settle phases
>    - Settling alone: 0.5 - 2 ms
>    - Total seek: Often 4 - 10 ms
>    - Average seek distance ≈ 1/3 max seek distance
>
> 2. **Rotational delay**:
>    - Depends on RPM (Rotations Per Minute)
>    - For 7200 RPM: 8.3 ms per full rotation
>    - Average rotational delay: 4.15 ms (half rotation)
>
> 3. **Transfer time**:
>    - Depends on RPM and sector density
>    - Typical maximum transfer rate: 100+ MB/s
>    - For 512-byte sector: ~5 μs (microseconds)
>
> **Workload performance**:
> - Sequential access (faster): Accessing sectors in order
> - Random access (slower): Accessing sectors arbitrarily
