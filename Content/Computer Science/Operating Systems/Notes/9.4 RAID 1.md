> [!idea] RAID 1: Mirroring
> RAID 1 implements **data redundancy through mirroring**:
> - **Core Concept**: Create exact copies (mirrors) of data across multiple disks
> - **Purpose**: Enhance data reliability and read performance
> - **Implementation**: Typically uses two disks, each containing an identical copy of all data

>     L["Logical Disk"] --> D1["Disk 1"]
>     L --> D2["Disk 2"]
>     D1 <--> |"Mirrored Data"| D2
> ```
> 
> **Analysis**:
> - **Capacity**: 50% of total physical capacity (e.g., two 1TB disks yield 1TB usable space)
> - **Write Performance**: Slightly decreased due to writing to multiple disks
> - **Read Performance**: Potentially improved through load balancing across mirrored disks

> [!consider] Fault Tolerance in RAID 1
> RAID 1 provides robust fault tolerance:
> - **Disk Failures**: System can tolerate failure of all but one disk
>   - Assuming disks are fail-stop (complete failure rather than partial or corrupted data)
> - **Recovery**: 
>   - Failed disk can be replaced without data loss
>   - System remains operational during disk replacement
> - **Limitations**: 
>   - Does not protect against data corruption or accidental deletion
>   - Higher cost per usable gigabyte compared to other RAID levels

> [!example] RAID 1 in Action
> Consider a RAID 1 setup with two 1TB disks:
> 
> **Scenario**: Writing a 100MB file
> 1. File is written to Disk 1
> 2. Identical copy is simultaneously written to Disk 2
> 
> **Reading the 100MB file**:
> - System can read 50MB from Disk 1 and 50MB from Disk 2 concurrently
> - Potential for improved read performance through load balancing
> 
> **Disk Failure Scenario**:
> 1. Disk 1 fails completely
> 2. System continues to operate using Disk 2
> 3. Failed Disk 1 is replaced
> 4. Data is rebuilt on new Disk 1 by copying from Disk 2
> 5. RAID 1 array returns to full redundancy
