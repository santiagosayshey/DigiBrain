> [!motivation] The Need for File System Structures
> - Efficient data structures are required to represent files and directories on disk
> - Methods for accessing and manipulating files (read, write) must be established
> - Similar to memory abstraction, a mapping between logical files and physical disk blocks is necessary

> [!idea] Disk Structures
> - Disks are represented as a large array of blocks
> - Files are abstracted entities that need to be mapped to these blocks
> - We need a structure to map files to disk blocks
> - This is similar to memory abstraction in operating systems

> Advantages:
> - Simple implementation
> - Excellent read performance (sequential access)
> - Minimal disk seeks for large files
> 
> Disadvantages:
> - Leads to external fragmentation
> - Difficult to accommodate file growth
> - Requires accurate size prediction or frequent reallocation
