> [!motivation] How do we implement file systems?
> File systems are a crucial component of operating systems, but how exactly are they implemented? To understand this, we need to explore:
> - The **data structures used to represent files and directories** 
> - The **methods** for accessing files, such as **reading and writing**

> [!idea] Disk structures for file systems
> | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Block 7 |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> | File A  | File A  | File B  | File B  | File C  | File C  | Free    | Free    |
>
> - Disks are divided into a large array of blocks
> - We need a structure to map files to these blocks 
> - This is similar to memory abstraction
>   - In the past, we've used contiguous, extend-based, linked, file allocation tables, indexed, and multi-level index approaches
>   - Fragmentation and file growth are important considerations

> [!consider] Contiguous allocation with extents
> | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Block 7 |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> | File A  | File A  | File A  | File A  | Free    | Extent  | Free    | Free    |
>
> - **Contiguous allocation** assigns consecutive disk blocks to a file.
> - **Extents**: In some systems, a small number of contiguous blocks (like Block 5 in the diagram) can be allocated as **extents**.
>   - Extents provide extra blocks to allow the file to grow without relocating it entirely.
>   - This minimizes fragmentation and allows space for file growth.
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Simple to implement.
>   - Good performance due to sequential access.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - Suffers from external fragmentation.
>   - Difficult to predict file growth and allocate appropriate space.

> [!consider] Linked allocation
> Linked allocation stores files as a linked list of fixed-size blocks scattered across the disk. Each block contains both **file data** and a **pointer** to the next block in the sequence.
> 
> | Block 0                 | Block 1 | Block 2                 | Block 3                 | Block 4 | Block 5                 | Block 6                 | Block 7                 |
> |-------------------------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
> | File A (Next: Block 3)   | Free    | File B (Next: Block 6)   | File A (Next: Block 7)   | Free    | File B (Next: Block 5)   | File B (Next: End)       | File A (Next: End)       |
> 
> - **File A** starts in Block 0, then points to Block 3, and finally to Block 7.
> - **File B** starts in Block 2, then points to Block 6, and finally to Block 5.
> 
> - **Advantages**:
>   - No external fragmentation, as blocks do not need to be contiguous.
>   - Can easily grow by adding more blocks.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - Internal fragmentation occurs because space is wasted for pointers.
>   - Every block requires a pointer, which wastes space.

> [!consider] File Allocation Table (FAT)
> FAT uses a **centralized table to store the pointers that link file blocks together**, rather than storing the pointers in the blocks themselves.
>
> **FAT Table:**
> 
> | Block Number | Next Block |
> |--------------|------------|
> | 0            | 3          |
> | 1            | -          |
> | 2            | 6          |
> | 3            | 7          |
> | 4            | -          |
> | 5            | End        |
> | 6            | 5          |
> | 7            | End        |
>
> **Disk Blocks:**
> 
> | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Block 7 |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> | File A  | Free    | File B  | File A  | Free    | File B  | File B  | File A  |
>
> - **File A**: Blocks 0, 3, and 7 are linked together by pointers stored in the FAT.
> - **File B**: Blocks 2, 6, and 5 are linked together by pointers stored in the FAT.
> 
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Centralized management of file blocks, making it easier to traverse files.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - The FAT can grow large and consume memory.


> [!consider] Indexed allocation
> Indexed allocation uses an **index block to store all the pointers to the fileâ€™s data blocks**. Each file has an index block, which holds pointers to the actual data blocks.
> 
> | Index Block | Points to Block |
> |-------------|-----------------|
> | Index 1     | Block 0         |
> | Index 2     | Block 3         |
> | Index 3     | Block 7         |
> 
> - **File A**: The index block contains pointers to the actual data blocks (Block 0, Block 3, and Block 7) where the file data is stored.
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Efficient random access to file blocks, as all pointers are contained in a single index block.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - Extra overhead for storing the index block.

> [!consider] Multi-level indexing
> Multi-level indexing is an extension of indexed allocation, where the index block points to other index blocks, allowing files to grow much larger than with a single index block.
> 
> | Index Block 1 | Points to Block |
> |---------------|-----------------|
> | Index 1       | Index Block 2   |
> 
> | Index Block 2 | Points to Block |
> |---------------|-----------------|
> | Index 1       | Block 0         |
> | Index 2       | Block 3         |
> | Index 3       | Block 7         |
> 
> - **File A**: Index Block 1 points to Index Block 2, which then points to the actual data blocks (Block 0, Block 3, and Block 7).
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Supports very large files by adding additional layers of indexing.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - More complex and involves additional overhead for multiple index blocks.

> [!consider] Flexible extents
> Flexible extents organize extents into a multi-level tree structure, where each leaf node contains the starting block and the contiguous size of the extent.
> 
> - **Tree structure**: The extents are organized in a tree-like structure for efficient access and growth.
> - **Each leaf node**: Contains the starting block and the size of the extent, reducing metadata overhead when there are few extents.
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Minimizes metadata overhead when only a small number of extents are used.
>   - Allows files to grow beyond a fixed number of extents, offering better scalability.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - Tree structures can introduce additional complexity and overhead.
