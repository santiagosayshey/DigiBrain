> [!motivation] How do we implement file systems?
> File systems are a crucial component of operating systems, but how exactly are they implemented? To understand this, we need to explore:
> - The **data structures used to represent files and directories** 
> - The **methods** for accessing files, such as **reading and writing**

> [!idea] Disk structures for file systems
> | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Block 7 |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> | File A  | File A  | File B  | File B  | File C  | File C  | Free    | Free    |
>
> - Disks are divided into a large array of blocks
> - We need a structure to map files to these blocks 
> - This is similar to memory abstraction
>   - In the past, we've used contiguous, extend-based, linked, file allocation tables, indexed, and multi-level index approaches
>   - Fragmentation and file growth are important considerations

> [!consider] Contiguous allocation with extents
> | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Block 7 |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> | File A  | File A  | File A  | File A  | Free    | Extent  | Free    | Free    |

> - **Contiguous allocation** assigns consecutive disk blocks to a file.
> - **Extents**: In some systems, a small number of contiguous blocks (like Block 5 in the diagram) can be allocated as **extents**.
>   - Extents provide extra blocks to allow the file to grow without relocating it entirely.
>   - This minimizes fragmentation and allows space for file growth.
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Simple to implement.
>   - Good performance due to sequential access.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - Suffers from external fragmentation.
>   - Difficult to predict file growth and allocate appropriate space.



> [!consider] Linked allocation
> Linked allocation stores files as a linked list of fixed-size blocks scattered across the disk. Each block contains both **file data** and a **pointer** to the next block in the sequence.
> 
> | Block 0                 | Block 1 | Block 2                 | Block 3                 | Block 4 | Block 5                 | Block 6                 | Block 7                 |
> |-------------------------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
> | File A (Next: Block 3)   | Free    | File B (Next: Block 6)   | File A (Next: Block 7)   | Free    | File B (Next: Block 5)   | File B (Next: End)       | File A (Next: End)       |
> 
> - **File A** starts in Block 0, then points to Block 3, and finally to Block 7.
> - **File B** starts in Block 2, then points to Block 6, and finally to Block 5.
> 
> - **Advantages**:
>   - No external fragmentation, as blocks do not need to be contiguous.
>   - Can easily grow by adding more blocks.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - Internal fragmentation occurs because space is wasted for pointers.
>   - Every block requires a pointer, which wastes space.


> [!consider] File Allocation Table (FAT)
> FAT uses a centralized table to store the pointers that link file blocks together, rather than storing the pointers in the blocks themselves.
> 
> | Block 0 | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Block 7 |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
> | File A  | Free    | File B  | File A  | Free    | File B  | File B  | File A  |
> | Next: 3 | -       | Next: 6 | Next: 7 | -       | Next: 5 | End     | End     |
> 
> - **File A**: Blocks 0, 3, and 7 are linked together by pointers stored in the FAT.
> - **File B**: Blocks 2, 6, and 5 are linked together by pointers stored in the FAT.
> 
> - **Advantages**:
>   - Centralized management of file blocks, making it easier to traverse files.
> - **Disadvantages**:
>   - The FAT can grow large and consume memory.
