motivation - ok, but how do we actually implement file systems
- data structures to represent file, directories
- methods for access - read, write

idea - disk structures
- mermaid diagram showing large array of blocks on disk, with some external abstracted files
- we want some structure map files to these blocks (arrows pointing to them with ? )
- recall this is quite similar to memory abstraction
- well, how did we do this before?
	- contiguoius. extend based, linked, file allocation tables, indexed, multi level index
	- need to think about fragmentation, file growth
