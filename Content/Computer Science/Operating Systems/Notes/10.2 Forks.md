> [!motivation] Need for Efficient Process Creation
> Operating systems require the ability to create new processes quickly. However, creating entirely new processes from scratch can be resource-intensive. A more efficient approach is needed when:
> - Rapid process creation is necessary
> - System resources are limited
> - Large applications need to spawn multiple instances

> [!idea] Fork System Call
> The fork system call creates a new process by duplicating an existing process, but with key optimizations:
> - **Logical Duplication**: Creates a child process as a logical copy of the parent
> - **Copy-on-Write (COW)**: Initially shares memory pages between parent and child
> - **Delayed Physical Copying**: Actual copying of memory occurs only when either process modifies shared data
> - **Efficiency**: Avoids immediate full memory duplication, saving time and resources

> [!example] Factorio Saving on Linux
> Factorio, a complex simulation game, uses fork and Copy-on-Write for efficient background saving on Linux:
> 1. Game initiates save process
> 2. Main process forks, creating a child process
> 3. Child process handles saving while main process continues game execution
> 4. COW allows:
>    - Minimal initial memory overhead (shared pages)
>    - Game to continue running smoothly during save
>    - Child process to access game state without full duplication
> 5. As child process writes save data, it creates its own copies of modified pages
> 6. Once save completes, child process exits, freeing its resources

> [!consider] Fork and File Handling
> When a process forks, the child inherits file-related structures:
> - **File Descriptors**: Child receives copies of parent's open file descriptors
> - **File Table Entries**: Both processes share file table entries
>   - Includes current file offset
>   - Changes in one process affect the other
> - **Inode Table**: Shared between parent and child
>   - File status flags remain the same
>   - Reference counts may increase
> 
> Key points:
> - Child can access all files open in parent at fork time
> - File sharing behavior depends on subsequent operations
> - Closing a file descriptor in one process doesn't affect the other
