> [!motivation] File System Reliability
> File systems must **maintain data integrity despite various failure scenarios.** When a system crashes or loses power:
> - Write operations might be incomplete
> - Directory structures could become inconsistent
> - Inodes might reference invalid blocks
> - Blocks could be marked both used and free
> 
> These inconsistencies arise because file system updates require multiple disk writes. For example, creating a file involves:
> - Updating directory data
> - Allocating and writing inode
> - Updating bitmaps
> - Writing actual file data
> 
> A failure between any of these steps leaves the file system in an inconsistent state, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

> [!idea] File System Check (FSCK)
> FSCK provides recovery through post-crash consistency checking. It scans the entire filesystem through a series of passes, each focusing on specific consistency aspects. Each pass builds upon information gathered in previous passes.
> 
> **Verification Passes**:
> 
> | Pass | Purpose | Checks Performed | Resolution Actions |
> |------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
> | 1. Superblock | Verify filesystem foundation | - Block and inode counts<br> - Free block maps<br> - Mount state<br> - File system size | - Fix basic parameters<br> - Update magic numbers<br> - Correct free counts |
> | 2. Inode State | Validate all inodes | - Format and type validity<br> - Permission consistency<br> - Block pointer validity<br> - Size calculations | - Clear invalid inodes<br> - Fix corrupted inode fields<br> - Rebuild block lists |
> | 3. Directory Structure | Check directory hierarchy | - Directory format<br> - Parent-child links<br> - Path connectivity<br> - Entry validity | - Remove corrupt entries<br> - Fix '.' and '..' entries<br> - Break directory cycles |
> | 4. Link Counts | Verify reference consistency | - Hard link counts<br> - Directory references<br> - Orphaned files | - Update link counts<br> - Move unreferenced files to lost+found<br> - Remove unlinked inodes |
> | 5. Free Blocks | Validate block allocation | - Block ownership<br> - Duplicate allocations<br> - Free block bitmap | - Fix multiply-allocated blocks<br> - Rebuild free block map<br> - Clear unreferenced blocks |
> 
> **Integrity Guarantees**:
> - Each pass must complete before the next begins
> - Fixes are applied immediately when found
> - All modifications are logged for potential rollback
> - System remains unmounted during entire process

> [!example] FSCK in Action
> Consider a system crash during file creation that leaves these inconsistencies:
> 
> **Initial State**:
> ```
> Directory Entry: new_file â†’ inode 67
> Inode 67: Marked allocated, points to blocks [100, 101]
> Bitmap: Block 100 marked used, 101 still marked free
> ```
> 
> **FSCK Recovery Process**:
> 1. **Superblock Scan**:
>    - Verifies filesystem parameters intact
>    - Confirms overall structure readable
> 
> 2. **Inode Check**:
>    ```
>    Found: Inode 67
>    - Status: Allocated
>    - Blocks: [100, 101]
>    - Issue: Block 101 marked free but claimed
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Resolution**:
>    - Marks block 101 as used in bitmap
>    - Updates checksums
>    - Logs correction in fsck output

> [!consider] FSCK Limitations
> While FSCK provides recovery, it has significant drawbacks:
> 
> **Performance Issues**:
> - Must scan entire filesystem
> - Runtime proportional to filesystem size
> - Can take hours on modern large disks
> 
> **Recovery Limitations**:
> - Cannot always determine correct state
> - May lose recent changes
> - Moves suspicious files to lost+found
> 
> **Operational Impact**:
> - Requires filesystem to be unmounted
> - Blocks system availability during check
> - Forces downtime after crashes
> 
> These limitations led to the development of journaling filesystems, which maintain a log of changes to enable faster, more reliable recovery.
