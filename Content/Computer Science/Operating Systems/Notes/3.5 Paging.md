> [!motivation] Eliminating External Fragmentation
> In memory management, external fragmentation occurs when there is **enough total memory** to satisfy an allocation request, but the **available memory is not contiguous**. This leads to inefficient memory utilization and can prevent processes from being loaded into memory even when sufficient total memory exists.
> 
> To address this issue, we need a memory management technique that:
> - **Eliminates the requirement for contiguous memory allocation**
> - Allows segments to grow as needed without relying on adjacent free memory

> [!idea] Paging
> Paging is a memory management scheme that **divides the virtual address space into fixed-size units called pages and the physical memory into frames of the same size.**
> - Virtual address space is divided into pages of a fixed size, typically a power of 2 (e.g., 4KiB)
> - Physical memory is divided into frames of the same size as the pages
> - Instead of allocating contiguous memory to processes, individual pages are assigned to frames in physical memory
> - Pages belonging to a process do not need to be stored in adjacent frames, allowing for flexibility in memory allocation

> [!idea] Benefits and Implications of Paging
> - **Elimination of External Fragmentation**: By allowing pages to be allocated to non-contiguous frames, paging effectively eliminates external fragmentation. The physical memory can be utilized more efficiently, as small gaps between allocated memory no longer hinder the allocation of new processes.
> 
> - **Flexibility in Memory Allocation**: Paging enables processes to grow or shrink their memory usage by allocating or deallocating individual pages. This flexibility allows for more efficient memory utilization and accommodates the dynamic memory requirements of processes.
> 
> - **Page Tables**: To keep track of the mapping between virtual pages and physical frames, a data structure called a page table is used. **Each process has its own page table, which contains entries that map virtual page numbers to physical frame numbers**. The page table is consulted during memory accesses to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses.

> [!consider] Translation from Virtual to Physical Addresses
> When memory is not stored contiguously in physical memory, a new **challenge** arises: **locating the next piece of memory for a process.**
> - In a paging system, each virtual address consists of a page number and an offset within the page
> - To access physical memory, the system needs to **translate the virtual address into a corresponding physical address**
> - The translation process involves **converting the virtual page number to a physical frame number and appending the offset**

> [!idea] Page Address Translation
> To translate a virtual address to a physical address, the system uses the following steps:
> 1. **Extract the Page Number**: The high-order bits of the virtual address represent the page number. The number of bits used for the page number depends on the size of the virtual address space and the page size.
> 2. **Extract the Offset**: The low-order bits of the virtual address represent the offset within the page. The number of bits used for the offset depends on the page size.
> 3. **Translate Page Number to Frame Number**: The system looks up the page number in the process's page table to find the corresponding frame number in physical memory.
> 4. **Construct Physical Address**: The physical address is constructed by concatenating the frame number obtained from the page table with the offset from the virtual address.
> 
> By performing this translation, the system can locate the physical memory location corresponding to a given virtual address, even when the pages are not stored contiguously in physical memory.

> [!example] Comprehensive Address Translation Example
> Let's consider a system with the following specifications:
> - Virtual address size: 32 bits
> - Physical address size: 28 bits
> - Page size: 4 KB ($2^{12}$ bytes)
> 
> Given a virtual address: 0x1A2B3C4D
> 
> Step 1: Determine the number of bits for offset and page number
> - Offset bits = $\log_2(\text{page size}) = \log_2(4 \text{ KB}) = 12 \text{ bits}$
>   - We use $\log_2$ because each bit represents a power of 2. With 12 bits, we can represent offsets from 0 to $2^{12} - 1$, which covers all possible offsets within a 4 KB page.
> - Page number bits = virtual address size - offset bits = $32 - 12 = 20 \text{ bits}$
>   - The remaining bits in the virtual address are used for the page number.
> 
> Step 2: Extract the page number and offset from the virtual address
> - Virtual address in binary: 0001 1010 0010 1011 0011 1100 0100 1101
> - Page number: 0001 1010 0010 1011 0011 11 (20 bits)
> - Offset: 00 0100 1101 (12 bits)
> 
> Step 3: Translate the page number to the frame number
> - Assume the page table entry for this page number contains the frame number: 0x1A2B3 (in reality, the frame number would be looked up in the page table)
> 
> Step 4: Construct the physical address
> - Physical address = frame number + offset
> - Frame number: 0001 1010 0010 1011 0011 (20 bits)
> - Offset: 00 0100 1101 (12 bits)
> - Physical address: 0001 1010 0010 1011 0011 00 0100 1101
> 
> Therefore, the virtual address 0x1A2B3C4D is translated to the physical address 0x1A2B34D.
> 
> This example demonstrates how the virtual address is divided into the page number and offset, and how the page number is translated to the frame number to construct the physical address. The page table plays a crucial role in this translation process by storing the mapping between virtual page numbers and physical frame numbers.

> [!consider] Disadvantages of Paging
> While paging offers several benefits, such as eliminating external fragmentation and enabling flexible memory allocation, it also introduces some disadvantages:
> 
> 1. **Internal Fragmentation**: 
>    - Paging can lead to internal fragmentation within each page. 
>    - If a process requires less memory than the page size, the remaining memory within the page remains unused. 
>    - For example, if a process needs 2.5 KB of memory and the page size is 4 KB, there will be 1.5 KB of unused memory within the allocated page.
>    - Internal fragmentation can result in suboptimal memory utilization, especially when processes have small memory requirements compared to the page size.
> 
> 2. **Additional Memory References**: 
>    - Paging introduces an additional level of indirection during memory accesses. 
>    - Each memory reference requires translating the virtual address to the physical address using the page table. 
>    - This translation process adds overhead to memory accesses, as it requires accessing the page table and performing the necessary calculations.
>    - The impact of this overhead can be mitigated through the use of translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) that cache recently used page table entries.
> 
> 3. **Page Table Storage Overhead**:
>    - Paging requires maintaining page tables to store the mappings between virtual page numbers and physical frame numbers. 
>    - The size of the page tables grows with the size of the virtual address space and the number of processes. 
>    - For systems with large virtual address spaces and numerous processes, the storage overhead for page tables can be significant. 
>    - Page tables consume memory that could otherwise be used for other purposes, reducing the available memory for processes.
>    - To mitigate this overhead, techniques such as multi-level page tables and page table swapping can be employed.
