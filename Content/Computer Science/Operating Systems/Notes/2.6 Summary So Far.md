> We want processes to directly execute on the CPU because...
> - It allows for efficient execution of user programs
> - Enables processes to run at the full speed of the hardware
> - Avoids the overhead of interpreting or emulating instructions
> 
> We achieve this through virtualization which...
> - Creates the illusion that each process has exclusive use of the CPU
> - Allows multiple processes to run concurrently on a single processor
> - Manages the switching between processes transparently to the user
> 
> Direct execution is unsafe so we limit execution through the kernel which...
> - Operates in a privileged mode with full access to system resources
> - Provides controlled entry points for user programs via system calls
> - Validates user input and ensures system integrity during privileged operations
> - Manages the transition between user mode and kernel mode
> 
> We choose which processes get access to the CPU by...
> - Using dispatching, which is the mechanism that switches the CPU from one process to another
>   - It involves saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the next process
> - Employing scheduling, which is the strategy used to determine which process should be dispatched next
>   - It maintains a queue of ready-to-run processes and selects the next process based on a scheduling algorithm
>   - The goal is to balance system objectives like fairness, throughput, and response time
