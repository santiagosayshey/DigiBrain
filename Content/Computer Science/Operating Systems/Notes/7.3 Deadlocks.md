> [!example] Dining Lawyers Problem
> Five lawyers sit around a circular table, each with a plate of spaghetti and a single fork between each pair of lawyers. To eat, a lawyer needs two forks.

> 
> The problem unfolds as follows:
> 1. Each lawyer follows this routine:
>    - Think (don't need forks)
>    - Pick up left fork
>    - Pick up right fork
>    - Eat
>    - Put down right fork
>    - Put down left fork
> 
> 2. Deadlock scenario:
>    - If all lawyers simultaneously pick up their left forks, none can pick up their right forks.
>    - All lawyers are now holding one fork and waiting for another, creating a circular wait.
> 
> 3. This demonstrates all four conditions for deadlock:
>    - **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one lawyer can use a fork at a time.
>    - **Hold and Wait**: Lawyers hold one resource (left fork) while waiting for another (right fork).
>    - **No Preemption**: Forks cannot be forcibly taken from lawyers.
>    - **Circular Wait**: Each lawyer is waiting for the fork held by the next lawyer.
> 
> Possible solutions:
> - Allow only four lawyers to sit at the table at once.
> - Instruct an odd-numbered lawyer to pick up the right fork first, then the left.
> - Use a semaphore to limit the number of lawyers who can simultaneously attempt to pick up forks.

> [!example] Factorio Trains Deadlock
> Consider our Factorio railway system from before. If we add 1 more train to the network, we experience a deadlock. Each train is trying to move to a station that is mutually blocked by another train. A train in the top left is trying to get to the bottom right, but cant because a train is there. That train is trying to get to the bottom left, because there is a train there also!

> This scenario mirrors the deadlock conditions:
> 1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Each track segment can only be used by one train at a time.
> 2. **Hold and Wait**: Each train holds one track while waiting for the other.
> 3. **No Preemption**: Trains can't be forcibly removed from tracks.
> 4. **Circular Wait**: Train A-B is waiting for Train C-D, which is waiting for Train A-B.

> [!idea] Deadlock
> A deadlock is a concurrent systems problem where **two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.**
> 
> Key characteristics of a deadlock:
> - **Mutual Exclusion**: A resource is exclusively owned by a single process.
> - **Hold and Wait**: A process must be holding at least one resource while waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
> - **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away; they must be released voluntarily by the process holding them.
> - **Circular Wait**: A circular chain of two or more processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.
> 
> **Key Idea**: If you remove any one of these characteristics, you remove the deadlock!

> [!idea] Solution: Wait-Free Algorithms
> Wait-free algorithms are a **concurrent programming technique** that ensures **every operation can complete in a finite number of steps, regardless of the actions of other threads.**
> 
> Key characteristics:
> - **Progress Guarantee**: Every thread makes progress in a finite number of steps, regardless of other threads' actions.
> - **Non-Blocking**: No thread can be prevented from making progress by the failure or suspension of other threads.
> - **Bounded Time**: Operations complete within a bounded number of steps.

> [!idea] Solution: Atomic Lock Acquisition
> One strategy to prevent deadlocks is to eliminate the "Hold and Wait" condition by **requiring processes to acquire all needed resources atomically in a single operation.**
> 
> Implementation:
> - Processes must request and be allocated all their required resources before execution.
> - If all resources are not available, the process must release any acquired resources and try again later.
> 
> | Advantages | Disadvantages |
> |------------|---------------|
> | Prevents deadlocks | May reduce concurrency |
> | Conceptually simple | Risk of process starvation |
> | Predictable allocation | Resource underutilization |
> 
> Example:
> ```python
> def acquire_resources(required_resources):
>     with global_lock:
>         if all(resource.available for resource in required_resources):
>             for resource in required_resources:
>                 resource.allocate()
>             return True
>         return False
> ```

> [!idea] Solution: Preemption
> This strategy prevents deadlocks by **allowing resources to be forcibly released if a process can't acquire all the resources it needs**, effectively removing the "No Preemption" condition.
> 
> Implementation:
> - If a process holding some resources requests another resource that cannot be immediately allocated, all resources currently held are preempted (released).
> - These released resources are added to the list of resources for which the process is waiting.
> - The process will be restarted only when it can regain its old resources, as well as the new ones it is requesting.
> 
> | Advantages | Disadvantages |
> |------------|---------------|
> | Prevents deadlocks | System overhead |
> | Progress for high-priority processes | Complex implementation |
> | Allows dynamic allocation | Potential for livelocks |
> 
> Example:
> ```python
> def acquire_resource(process, resource):
>     if resource.available:
>         resource.allocate(process)
>         return True
>     elif resource.owner.priority < process.priority:
>         preempt_and_allocate(resource, process)
>         return True
>     return False
> ```

> [!idea] Solution: Eliminating Circular Wait
> This strategy prevents deadlocks by **imposing a total ordering on resource acquisition**, ensuring that circular wait cannot occur.
> 
> Implementation:
> - Decide which locks should be acquired before others.
> - If lock A should be acquired before B, never acquire A if B is already held.
> - Document the lock ordering and write code accordingly.
> 
> | Advantages | Disadvantages |
> |------------|---------------|
> | Prevents deadlocks | Requires careful design |
> | Works well in layered systems | May limit flexibility |
> | Relatively simple to implement | Potential for lock convoy |
> 
> Example:
> ```python
> # Global lock order: lock1 < lock2 < lock3
> def safe_operation():
>     with lock1:
>         with lock2:
>             with lock3:
>                 # Perform operation
>                 pass
> ```
> 
> This approach is particularly effective in systems with distinct layers, where resource dependencies naturally follow a hierarchical structure.
