> [!motivation] The Need for Permanent Storage
> Computing systems require **permanent storage to persist data beyond the lifetime of processes or the computer itself.** This enables applications to store and retrieve data across sessions, even after the machine has been powered off.

> [!idea] Virtualizing Storage: Files as Persistent Byte Arrays
> Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage devices, presenting them as virtual resources. In this context, files are treated as **arrays of persistent bytes that can be read from or written to**. Files are identified using three types of names:
> 
> 1. I-node numbers: Unique identifiers assigned to each file by the file system.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20241017175241.png|300]]
> 
> 2. Paths: Human-readable, hierarchical names that represent the location of a file within the directory structure.
> 3. File descriptors: Non-negative integers returned by the kernel when a process opens a file, used for subsequent file operations.

> [!idea] Directories
> Directories are a special type of file used to organize and provide a hierarchical structure to the file system. They contain entries that **map human-readable names to i-node numbers**, allowing users to **navigate and locate files using meaningful paths**.
>
> Directories include two special entries:
> 1. ".": Refers to the directory itself.
> 2. "..": Refers to the parent directory.
> 
> These special entries allow for relative path navigation within the file system hierarchy.

> [!idea] File Descriptors
> File descriptors are **non-negative integers returned by the kernel** when a process opens a file. They serve as **unique identifiers for open files within a process** and are used for subsequent file operations.
> 
> When a file is opened, the kernel:
> 1. Performs an **expensive traversal** of the file system hierarchy to locate the file's i-node.
> 2. Stores the i-node information in a **descriptor object** in the kernel.
> 3. Returns the **index of the descriptor object** as the file descriptor to the process.
> 
> This approach **avoids repeated traversals** for each operation on the open file.
> 
> Three standard file descriptors are predefined:
> - 0: Standard input (stdin)
> - 1: Standard output (stdout)
> - 2: Standard error (stderr)
> 
> These descriptors enable communication with the process's environment.

> [!example] File System Traversal
> Consider the following file system hierarchy:
> 
> ```
> /
> ├── home/
> │   └── user/
> │       └── documents/
> │           └── report.txt
> └── etc/
>     └── config.ini
> ```
> 
> To open the file "/home/user/documents/report.txt", the kernel performs these steps:
> 
> 1. Start at the root directory ("/").
> 2. Find the entry for "home" in the root directory's i-node and retrieve its i-node number.
> 3. Access the "home" directory's i-node and find the entry for "user", retrieving its i-node number.
> 4. Access the "user" directory's i-node and find the entry for "documents", retrieving its i-node number.
> 5. Access the "documents" directory's i-node and find the entry for "report.txt", retrieving its i-node number.
> 6. Access the i-node of "report.txt" to obtain the file's metadata and data block addresses.
> 
> The kernel then creates a descriptor object containing the file's i-node information and returns the index of this object as the file descriptor to the process.

> [!example] x86 File API Usage
> Consider a program that opens a file, reads its contents, and writes them to another file:
> 
> ```c
> #include <fcntl.h>
> #include <unistd.h>
> 
> int main() {
>     int fd_in = open("input.txt", O_RDONLY);
>     int fd_out = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
>     
>     char buffer[1024];
>     ssize_t bytes_read;
>     
>     while ((bytes_read = read(fd_in, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) > 0) {
>         write(fd_out, buffer, bytes_read);
>     }
>     
>     close(fd_in);
>     close(fd_out);
>     
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
> 
> This program:
> 1. Opens "input.txt" for reading using `open()`, which returns a file descriptor (fd_in).
> 2. Opens "output.txt" for writing using `open()`, which returns another file descriptor (fd_out).
> 3. Reads data from fd_in into a buffer using `read()` in a loop until the end of the file is reached.
> 4. Writes the data from the buffer to fd_out using `write()`.
> 5. Closes both file descriptors using `close()`.
> 
> Here's a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationship between file descriptors, the file descriptor table, and i-nodes:
> 
> ```mermaid
> classDiagram
>     FileDescriptor "1" --> "1" FileDescriptorTable : indexes
>     FileDescriptorTable "1" --> "*" FileDescriptorEntry : contains
>     FileDescriptorEntry "1" --> "1" FileObject : points to
>     FileObject "1" --> "1" Inode : references
> ```
> 
> The diagram shows that:
> 1. A file descriptor is an index into the file descriptor table.
> 2. The file descriptor table contains multiple file descriptor entries.
> 3. Each file descriptor entry points to a file object.
> 4. The file object references the corresponding i-node, which contains the file's metadata and data block addresses.
> 
> The `open()` function creates a new entry in the file descriptor table, associating the file descriptor with the file object and i-node. The `read()` and `write()` functions use the file descriptor to access the file object and perform I/O operations. The `close()` function removes the entry from the file descriptor table, disassociating the file descriptor from the file object.

consider - deleting files
- inode and associated file is garbage collection when there are no references (from paths of fds) - what does this mean?
- paths are deleted when unlink is called
- FDs are deleted when close or the process quits
