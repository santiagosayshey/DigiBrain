> [!motivation] The Need for Permanent Storage
> Computing systems require **permanent storage to persist data beyond the lifetime of processes or the computer itself.** This enables applications to store and retrieve data across sessions, even after the machine has been powered off.

> [!idea] Virtualizing Storage: Files as Persistent Byte Arrays
> Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage devices, presenting them as virtual resources. In this context, files are treated as **arrays of persistent bytes that can be read from or written to**. Files are identified using three types of names:
> 
> 1. I-node numbers: Unique identifiers assigned to each file by the file system.

> 
> 2. Paths: Human-readable, hierarchical names that represent the location of a file within the directory structure.
> 3. File descriptors: Non-negative integers returned by the kernel when a process opens a file, used for subsequent file operations.

> [!idea] Directories
> Directories are a special type of file used to organize and provide a hierarchical structure to the file system. They contain entries that **map human-readable names to i-node numbers**, allowing users to **navigate and locate files using meaningful paths**.
>
> Directories include two special entries:
> 1. ".": Refers to the directory itself.
> 2. "..": Refers to the parent directory.
> 
> These special entries allow for relative path navigation within the file system hierarchy.

> [!idea] File Descriptors
> File descriptors are **non-negative integers returned by the kernel** when a process opens a file. They serve as **unique identifiers for open files within a process** and are used for subsequent file operations.
> 
> When a file is opened, the kernel:
> 1. Performs an **expensive traversal** of the file system hierarchy to locate the file's i-node.
> 2. Stores the i-node information in a **descriptor object** in the kernel.
> 3. Returns the **index of the descriptor object** as the file descriptor to the process.
> 
> This approach **avoids repeated traversals** for each operation on the open file.
> 
> Three standard file descriptors are predefined:
> - 0: Standard input (stdin)
> - 1: Standard output (stdout)
> - 2: Standard error (stderr)
> 
> These descriptors enable communication with the process's environment.
