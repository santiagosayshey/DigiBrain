> [!motivation] The Need for Permanent Storage
> Computing systems require **permanent storage to persist data beyond the lifetime of processes or the computer itself.** This enables applications to store and retrieve data across sessions, even after the machine has been powered off.

> [!idea] Virtualizing Storage: Files as Persistent Byte Arrays
> Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage devices, presenting them as virtual resources. In this context, files are treated as **arrays of persistent bytes that can be read from or written to**. Files are identified using three types of names:
> 
> 1. I-node numbers: Unique identifiers assigned to each file by the file system.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20241017175241.png|300]]
> 
> 2. Paths: Human-readable, hierarchical names that represent the location of a file within the directory structure.
> 3. File descriptors: Non-negative integers returned by the kernel when a process opens a file, used for subsequent file operations.

> [!idea] Directories
> Directories are a special type of file used to organize and provide a hierarchical structure to the file system. They contain entries that **map human-readable names to i-node numbers**, allowing users to **navigate and locate files using meaningful paths**.
>
> Directories include two special entries:
> 1. ".": Refers to the directory itself.
> 2. "..": Refers to the parent directory.
> 
> These special entries allow for relative path navigation within the file system hierarchy.

> [!idea] File Descriptors
> File descriptors are **non-negative integers returned by the kernel** when a process opens a file. They serve as **unique identifiers for open files within a process** and are used for subsequent file operations.
> 
> When a file is opened, the kernel:
> 1. Performs an **expensive traversal** of the file system hierarchy to locate the file's i-node.
> 2. Stores the i-node information in a **descriptor object** in the kernel.
> 3. Returns the **index of the descriptor object** as the file descriptor to the process.
> 
> This approach **avoids repeated traversals** for each operation on the open file.
> 
> Three standard file descriptors are predefined:
> - 0: Standard input (stdin)
> - 1: Standard output (stdout)
> - 2: Standard error (stderr)
> 
> These descriptors enable communication with the process's environment.

> [!example] File System Traversal
> Consider the following file system hierarchy:
> 
> ```
> /
> ├── home/
> │   └── user/
> │       └── documents/
> │           └── report.txt
> └── etc/
>     └── config.ini
> ```
> 
> To open the file "/home/user/documents/report.txt", the kernel performs these steps:
> 
> 1. Start at the root directory ("/").
> 2. Find the entry for "home" in the root directory's i-node and retrieve its i-node number.
> 3. Access the "home" directory's i-node and find the entry for "user", retrieving its i-node number.
> 4. Access the "user" directory's i-node and find the entry for "documents", retrieving its i-node number.
> 5. Access the "documents" directory's i-node and find the entry for "report.txt", retrieving its i-node number.
> 6. Access the i-node of "report.txt" to obtain the file's metadata and data block addresses.
> 
> The kernel then creates a descriptor object containing the file's i-node information and returns the index of this object as the file descriptor to the process.

> [!example] x86 File API Usage
> Consider a program that opens a file, reads its contents, and writes them to another file:
> 
> ```c
> #include <fcntl.h>
> #include <unistd.h>
> 
> int main() {
>     int fd_in = open("input.txt", O_RDONLY);
>     int fd_out = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
>     
>     char buffer[1024];
>     ssize_t bytes_read;
>     
>     while ((bytes_read = read(fd_in, buffer, sizeof(buffer))) > 0) {
>         write(fd_out, buffer, bytes_read);
>     }
>     
>     close(fd_in);
>     close(fd_out);
>     
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
> 
> This program:
> 1. Opens "input.txt" for reading using `open()`, which returns a file descriptor (fd_in).
> 2. Opens "output.txt" for writing using `open()`, which returns another file descriptor (fd_out).
> 3. Reads data from fd_in into a buffer using `read()` in a loop until the end of the file is reached.
> 4. Writes the data from the buffer to fd_out using `write()`.
> 5. Closes both file descriptors using `close()`.
> 
> Here's a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationship between file descriptors, the file descriptor table, and i-nodes:
> 
> ```mermaid
> classDiagram
>     FileDescriptor "1" --> "1" FileDescriptorTable : indexes
>     FileDescriptorTable "1" --> "*" FileDescriptorEntry : contains
>     FileDescriptorEntry "1" --> "1" FileObject : points to
>     FileObject "1" --> "1" Inode : references
> ```
> 
> The diagram shows that:
> 1. A file descriptor is an index into the file descriptor table.
> 2. The file descriptor table contains multiple file descriptor entries.
> 3. Each file descriptor entry points to a file object.
> 4. The file object references the corresponding i-node, which contains the file's metadata and data block addresses.
> 
> The `open()` function creates a new entry in the file descriptor table, associating the file descriptor with the file object and i-node. The `read()` and `write()` functions use the file descriptor to access the file object and perform I/O operations. The `close()` function removes the entry from the file descriptor table, disassociating the file descriptor from the file object.

> [!consider] Deleting Files: I-node and File Garbage Collection
> When a file is deleted, the associated i-node and file data are not immediately removed from the file system. Instead, they are marked for garbage collection when there are no more references to them. This means that the i-node and file data will be permanently deleted only when:
>
> 1. All paths (directory entries) referring to the i-node are removed using the `unlink()` system call.
> 2. All file descriptors referring to the file are closed using the `close()` system call or when the process that opened the file exits.
>

> [!consider] Non-Sequential Reads and Writes: Handling Offsets
> When performing non-sequential reads and writes on a file, it's important to consider the offset at which the operation should occur. The offset specifies the number of bytes from the beginning of the file where the read or write operation should start.
>
> Here's how offsets are handled in non-sequential reads and writes:
>
> 1. The `lseek()` system call is used to change the current file offset associated with a file descriptor. It takes the file descriptor, an offset value, and a reference point (e.g., beginning of the file, current position, or end of the file) as arguments.
> 2. When a read or write operation is performed using `read()` or `write()`, it starts at the current file offset associated with the file descriptor.
> 3. After the read or write operation, the file offset is automatically adjusted by the number of bytes read or written, preparing for the next sequential operation.
> 4. To perform non-sequential reads or writes, `lseek()` is used to explicitly set the file offset to the desired position before calling `read()` or `write()`.
> 5. Multiple processes or threads can independently maintain their own file offsets for the same file descriptor, allowing for concurrent non-sequential access to the file.
>
> For example, to read from a specific offset in a file:
>
> ```c
> off_t offset = 100;
> lseek(fd, offset, SEEK_SET);
> read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
> ```
>
> In this example, `lseek()` is used to set the file offset to 100 bytes from the beginning of the file (`SEEK_SET`). The subsequent `read()` operation will start reading from that offset.
>
> By using `lseek()` to manipulate the file offset, non-sequential reads and writes can be achieved, providing random access to different parts of a file.
