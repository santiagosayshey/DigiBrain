> [!motivation] Disk I/O Scheduling Challenges
> In computer systems, managing disk I/O operations presents unique challenges compared to CPU scheduling. The physical nature of disk drives introduces complexities:
> 
> - Multiple concurrent requests for reading or writing data
> - Mechanical movement of disk components (e.g., read/write heads)
> - Seek time and rotational latency impact overall performance
> 
> The key question becomes: In what order should I/O requests be served to maximize efficiency? Unlike CPU scheduling, where job length is often the primary consideration, disk scheduling must account for the position of the disk head relative to the requested data location.

> [!idea] First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
> FCFS is the simplest I/O scheduling algorithm, processing requests in the order they arrive. While straightforward to implement, it often leads to suboptimal performance.
> 
> Characteristics:
> - Fair allocation of disk resources
> - No prioritization or optimization of disk head movement
> - Can result in excessive seek times if requests are scattered across the disk
> 
> | Pros | Cons |
> |------|------|
> | Simple implementation | Potentially high average seek time |
> | No starvation | Poor overall throughput |
> | Predictable behavior | Inefficient for mixed workloads |

> [!example] FCFS in Action
> Consider a disk with requests at tracks: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
> 
> FCFS order: 98 → 183 → 37 → 122 → 14 → 124 → 65 → 67
> 
> Total head movement: 640 tracks
> 
> This example demonstrates how FCFS can lead to excessive back-and-forth movement of the disk head, resulting in poor performance.

> [!idea] Shortest Positioning Time First (SPTF)
> SPTF, also known as Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), prioritizes requests closest to the current disk head position. This approach aims to minimize the overall seek time between requests.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Dynamically selects the next request based on proximity
> - Significantly reduces overall disk head movement
> - Can lead to improved throughput and reduced average wait times
> 
> However, SPTF is not without drawbacks. It may cause starvation of requests for data located far from the current head position, especially under heavy loads.

> [!example] SPTF in Action
> Using the same requests: 98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
> Assume current head position: 53
> 
> SPTF order: 65 → 67 → 37 → 14 → 98 → 122 → 124 → 183
> 
> Total head movement: 236 tracks
> 
> This example illustrates how SPTF reduces total head movement by servicing nearby requests first, leading to improved efficiency compared to FCFS.

> [!idea] SCAN (Elevator) Algorithm
> The SCAN algorithm, often called the elevator algorithm, takes a different approach:
> 
> 1. The disk head moves in one direction across the disk
> 2. It services requests in its path
> 3. Upon reaching the end, it reverses direction and repeats
> 
> This method combines some of the benefits of FCFS and SPTF while mitigating their drawbacks. It provides a balance between efficiency and fairness, reducing the likelihood of request starvation.


> [!idea] Work Conservation
> Work conservation in I/O scheduling refers to keeping the disk busy when there are pending requests. A work-conserving scheduler:
> - Never idles the disk if there are I/O requests waiting
> - Aims to maximize disk utilization and system throughput
> - May need to balance this goal with other scheduling objectives
> - Is particularly important in high-load scenarios
> 
> Different scheduling algorithms naturally exhibit varying degrees of work conservation, impacting their efficiency and performance characteristics.
