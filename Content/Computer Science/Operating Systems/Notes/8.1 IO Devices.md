> [!motivation] Persistence and Interaction
> Computers are designed to be interactive and persistent devices, but their **usefulness is limited without effective means for users to interact with them and store data between sessions.**
> - **Interaction**: Computers need input/output (I/O) devices to allow users to provide instructions and receive results.
> - **Persistence**: Computers require storage devices to retain data and progress, avoiding the need to start from scratch each time.

> [!idea] I/O Devices
> I/O devices enable communication between users and computers, allowing for data input, output, and storage.
> 
> | Device Type | Description | Examples |
> |-------------|-------------|----------|
> | Input       | Accepts user input and converts it into computer-readable form | Keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone |
> | Output      | Presents computer-processed data to the user in human-readable form | Monitor, printer, speakers |
> | Storage     | Stores data persistently for later retrieval | Hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD), USB flash drive |

> [!consider] Supporting I/O Devices
> How do computers support the wide variety of I/O devices available?
> - **Standardized Interfaces**: Computers use standardized communication protocols and physical connectors to ensure compatibility with a broad range of devices.
> - **Expandability**: Computers often include expansion slots and ports, allowing users to add new devices as needed.
> - **Device Drivers**: Software drivers enable the operating system to recognize and communicate with specific I/O devices, abstracting hardware differences.


> [!idea] Buses and Interfaces
> Buses and interfaces are standardized **communication pathways that allow computers to connect and communicate with I/O devices.** They define the physical connectors, electrical signaling, and communication protocols used to transmit data between the computer and connected devices.

> | Bus/Interface | Description | Usage | Status |
> |---------------|-------------|-------|--------|
> | PCI           | Peripheral Component Interconnect, a parallel bus for connecting expansion cards | Graphics cards, network adapters, sound cards | Largely replaced by PCIe, but still used in older systems |
> | PCIe          | PCI Express, a high-speed serial expansion bus | Graphics cards, NVMe SSDs, high-performance I/O devices | Current standard for expansion cards |
> | NVMe          | Non-Volatile Memory Express, a protocol for connecting SSDs to a computer over PCIe | High-performance SSDs | Gaining popularity due to its high throughput and low latency |
> | SATA          | Serial ATA, a bus for connecting storage devices | Hard disk drives, SSDs, optical drives | Widely used, but gradually being replaced by NVMe |
> | USB           | Universal Serial Bus, a versatile bus for connecting various peripherals | Keyboards, mice, external storage, printers, cameras | Ubiquitous, with USB 3.x and USB 4 offering high speeds |
> | Thunderbolt   | A high-bandwidth, multi-protocol interface for connecting displays and high-performance peripherals | External GPUs, high-resolution displays, fast external storage | Gaining popularity, especially in professional contexts |
> | SCSI          | Small Computer System Interface, a parallel interface for connecting storage devices and peripherals | Hard drives, tape drives, scanners | Mostly replaced by SATA and SAS in modern systems, but still used in some server environments |
> | FireWire      | A high-speed serial bus for connecting audio/video devices and storage | Digital video cameras, external hard drives | Largely replaced by USB and Thunderbolt |
