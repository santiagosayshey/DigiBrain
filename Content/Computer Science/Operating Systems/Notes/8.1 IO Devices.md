> [!motivation] Persistence and Interaction
> Computers are designed to be interactive and persistent devices, but their **usefulness is limited without effective means for users to interact with them and store data between sessions.**
> - **Interaction**: Computers need input/output (I/O) devices to allow users to provide instructions and receive results.
> - **Persistence**: Computers require storage devices to retain data and progress, avoiding the need to start from scratch each time.

> [!idea] I/O Devices
> I/O devices enable communication between users and computers, allowing for data input, output, and storage.

> | Device Type | Description | Examples |
> |-------------|-------------|----------|
> | Input       | Accepts user input and converts it into computer-readable form | Keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone |
> | Output      | Presents computer-processed data to the user in human-readable form | Monitor, printer, speakers |
> | Storage     | Stores data persistently for later retrieval | Hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD), USB flash drive |
