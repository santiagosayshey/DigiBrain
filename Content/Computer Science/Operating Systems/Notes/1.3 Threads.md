> [!motivation] Concurrency Within Concurrency
> As programs became more complex, a new challenge emerged:
> 
> - **Programs often need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously**
> - These tasks may share resources and data
> - Creating separate processes for each task is resource-intensive
> - Switching between processes has significant overhead
> 
> A more lightweight solution was needed to achieve **concurrency within a single program**, leading to the development of threads.

> [!idea] Threads
> A thread is a **subset of a process** that:
> 
> - Represents an **independent sequence of instructions**
> - **Shares the process's resources** (memory space, open files) (whereas separate processes don't share resources)
> - Has its own:
>   - Program counter
>   - Register set
>   - Stack
> 
> Threads enable concurrent execution within a single process, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously while sharing a common set of resources.
> 
> Visualize: In our railway analogy, threads are like **multiple tracks that split from a single main track**:
> - The main railway line represents the process
> - The split tracks represent individual threads
> - Each track has its own signals and switches (program counter, registers)
> - The tracks eventually merge back into the main line, completing the process


> [!consider] Processes vs. Threads
> | Aspect | Processes | Threads |
> |--------|-----------|---------|
> | Resource Ownership | Own separate resources | Share process resources |
> | Memory Space | Separate | Shared |
> | Creation Overhead | Higher | Lower |
> | Context Switch Time | Longer | Shorter |
> | Communication | Inter-process communication (IPC) | Direct access to shared memory |
> | Isolation | Strong | Weaker |
> | Scalability | Limited by system resources | More scalable within a process |
> 
> Processes provide stronger isolation but with higher overhead, while threads offer lighter-weight concurrency within a shared context. The choice between processes and threads depends on the specific requirements of the application, balancing factors such as isolation, resource usage, and performance.

> [!example] Multiple Surfaces in Space Age
> Factorio: Space Age implements multiple surfaces (different planets) using threads:
> 
> **Main Thread**:
> - Handles player input and core game logic
> 
> **Surface Threads** (one per planet):
> - Update entity states (machines, belts, inserters)
> - Calculate resource extraction and production
> - Manage local power networks
> 
> **Shared Resource Thread**:
> - Coordinates resource transfer between surfaces
> - Manages global research progress
> 
> **Rendering Thread**:
> - Draws the current surface and UI elements
> 
> **Pathfinding Thread**:
> - Calculates optimal paths for logistics bots across all surfaces
> 
> This multithreaded approach allows:
> - Seamless switching between surfaces without gameplay interruption
> - Continuous updating of all surfaces, even when not viewed
> - Efficient use of multi-core processors for complex calculations
> 
> Players experience a smooth, responsive game even with massive factories spanning multiple planets, each with thousands of active entities.
