I understand the instructions and will follow them carefully.

> [!motivation] Need for Efficient Process Creation
> Operating systems often require the ability to create new processes quickly. Traditional methods of process creation can be resource-intensive, involving copying entire memory spaces. This approach becomes problematic when:
> - Rapid process creation is necessary
> - System resources are limited
> - Large applications need to spawn multiple instances

> [!idea] Fork System Call
> The fork system call creates a new process by duplicating an existing process.
> - **Process Duplication**: Creates a child process as an exact copy of the parent
> - **Copy-on-Write (COW)**: Initially shares memory pages between parent and child
> - **Efficiency**: Avoids immediate full memory copy, saving time and resources
> - **Divergence**: Child process can modify its memory independently after creation

> [!example] Factorio Saving on Linux
> Factorio, a complex simulation game, uses fork and Copy-on-Write for efficient background saving on Linux.
> 1. Game initiates save process
> 2. Main process forks, creating a child process
> 3. Child process handles saving while main process continues game execution
> 4. COW allows:
>    - Minimal initial memory overhead
>    - Game to continue running smoothly during save
>    - Child process to modify memory as needed for save operation
> 5. Once save completes, child process exits

> [!consider] Fork and COW Implications
> - **Performance**: Reduces the time and resources needed for process creation
> - **Memory Management**: COW optimizes memory usage, especially for short-lived processes
> - **Limitations**: Not all operating systems support fork (e.g., Windows uses different mechanisms)
> - **Security**: Careful handling required to prevent data leaks between parent and child processes
