> [!motivation] File Linking
> Operating systems often need to **reference the same file from multiple locations without duplicating data**. This requirement arises in scenarios such as:
> - Organizing files in different directory structures
> - Sharing files between users or applications
> - Creating backups or versioning systems
> - Optimizing storage usage
> 
> File linking mechanisms address these needs by allowing multiple references to a single file.

> [!idea] Hard Links
> Hard links **create additional directory entries pointing to the same inode** (file data on disk).
> - Multiple filenames refer to the same physical data
> - Deleting one hard link doesn't affect others or the file data
> - Limited to the same filesystem
> - Cannot link to directories (in most systems)
> - File stays on disk until all hard links are deleted
>
> | Characteristic | Behavior |
> |----------------|----------|
> | Data location  | Same inode |
> | Cross-filesystem | No |
> | Link to directories | Generally no |
> | File deletion | When last link is removed |

> [!idea] Symbolic Links (Symlinks)
> Symbolic links are separate files that contain a path to the target file or directory.
> - Can link across different filesystems
> - Can link to directories
> - Broken links can occur if target is moved or deleted
> - Take up small amount of additional disk space
> - Easier to identify than hard links
>
> | Characteristic | Behavior |
> |----------------|----------|
> | Data location  | Separate file with path |
> | Cross-filesystem | Yes |
> | Link to directories | Yes |
> | File deletion | Target unaffected |

> [!consider] Usage Considerations
> When choosing between hard links and symbolic links:
> - Use hard links for:
>   - Ensuring file persistence (e.g., p2p downloading)
>   - Saving space with multiple references to large files
> - Use symbolic links for:
>   - Cross-filesystem linking
>   - Directory linking
>   - Creating easily identifiable references
> 
> Examples:
> - Hard link: Keep a large movie file seeding in a torrent client while referencing it in a media library with a different name.
> - Symbolic link: Create a shortcut in your home directory to a shared resource on a different drive.

A diagram showing:
1. A file on disk (inode)
2. Two hard links pointing to the same inode
3. A symbolic link as a separate file pointing to the original file's path
Label each component clearly and use different colors or styles for hard links and symbolic links.
