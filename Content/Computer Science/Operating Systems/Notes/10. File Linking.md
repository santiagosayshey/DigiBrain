> [!motivation] File Linking
> Operating systems often need to **reference the same file from multiple locations without duplicating data**. This requirement arises in scenarios such as:
> - Organizing files in different directory structures
> - Sharing files between users or applications
> - Creating backups or versioning systems
> - Optimizing storage usage
> 
> File linking mechanisms address these needs by allowing multiple references to a single file.

> [!idea] Hard Links
> Hard links **create additional directory entries pointing to the same inode** (file data on disk).
> - Multiple filenames refer to the same physical data
> - Deleting one hard link doesn't affect others or the file data
> - Limited to the same filesystem
> - Cannot link to directories (in most systems)
> - File stays on disk until all hard links are deleted
>
> | Characteristic | Behavior |
> |----------------|----------|
> | Data location  | Same inode |
> | Cross-filesystem | No |
> | Link to directories | Generally no |
> | File deletion | When last link is removed |

> [!example] Hard Link Example: Efficient File Organization
> 
> Scenario: Managing music files for a DJ setup
> 
> 1. Original file location: `/Music/Electronic/track01.mp3`
> 2. Create hard links for different playlists:
>    ```
>    ln /Music/Electronic/track01.mp3 /Playlists/Upbeat/energetic_opener.mp3
>    ln /Music/Electronic/track01.mp3 /Playlists/Chill/ambient_background.mp3
>    ```
> 3. Result:
>    - Three different paths now point to the same audio data
>    - Editing any version updates all of them
>    - Deleting one link doesn't affect the others
>    - Saves disk space by avoiding duplicates
> 
> Benefits:
> - Organize the same track in multiple playlists without copying
> - Save storage space while maintaining flexible file organization
> - Ensure all versions stay in sync when editing

> [!idea] Symbolic Links (Symlinks)
> Symbolic links are **separate files that contain a path to the target file or directory.**
> - Can link across different filesystems
> - Can link to directories
> - Broken links can occur if target is moved or deleted
> - Take up small amount of additional disk space
> - Easier to identify than hard links
>
> | Characteristic | Behavior |
> |----------------|----------|
> | Data location  | Separate file with path |
> | Cross-filesystem | Yes |
> | Link to directories | Yes |
> | File deletion | Target unaffected |

> [!example] Symbolic Link Example: Cross-filesystem Access
> 
> Scenario: Linking to a shared network drive
> 
> 1. Network drive mounted at: `/mnt/network/shared_projects`
> 2. Create a symbolic link in your home directory:
>    ```
>    ln -s /mnt/network/shared_projects ~/projects_shortcut
>    ```
> 3. Result:
>    - `~/projects_shortcut` now points to `/mnt/network/shared_projects`
>    - Access network files as if they were in your home directory
>    - The link works even though it's on a different filesystem
> 
> Benefits:
> - Easy access to remote files from familiar locations
> - Works across different filesystems (local and network)
> - Quickly adaptable if the network drive location changes
