> [!motivation] Beyond Peterson's Algorithm: The Need for Hardware Support
> While Peterson's algorithm provides a software-based solution for mutual exclusion, it has several limitations in real-world scenarios:
> 
> - **Limited to two threads:** Extending it to more threads is complex and inefficient
> - **Busy-waiting:** Consumes CPU cycles while waiting for the lock
> - **Reliance on sequential consistency:** Modern processors may reorder memory operations
> - **Performance concerns:** Software-only solutions can be slower than hardware-supported alternatives
> 
> These limitations led to the development and widespread adoption of hardware-supported synchronization primitives, which provide more efficient and scalable solutions for mutual exclusion in multi-threaded environments.

> [!idea] Locks with Test&Set or XCHG (Atomic Exchange)
> Hardware-supported atomic instructions like Test&Set or XCHG (Atomic Exchange) provide a more efficient way to implement locks.
> 
> **Key concepts:**
> - **Atomicity:** These instructions perform multiple operations as a single, uninterruptible unit
> - **Hardware support:** Implemented directly in the processor, ensuring efficiency and correctness
> 
> **Test&Set instruction:**
> - Atomically tests a memory location and sets it to a new value
> - Returns the original value
> 
> **XCHG (Atomic Exchange) instruction:**
> - Atomically swaps the contents of a register with a memory location
> - Commonly used on x86 architectures
> 
> **Implementation of a simple spin lock:**
> ```c
> typedef struct {
>     int flag;
> } lock_t;
> 
> void acquire_lock(lock_t *lock) {
>     while (atomic_exchange(&lock->flag, 1) == 1) {
>         // Spin-wait
>     }
> }
> 
> void release_lock(lock_t *lock) {
>     atomic_exchange(&lock->flag, 0);
> }
> ```

> [!example] Test&Set vs. XCHG in Action
> Consider two threads, A and B, trying to acquire a lock:
> 
> 1. Initially, `lock->flag = 0` (unlocked)
> 2. Thread A executes `atomic_exchange(&lock->flag, 1)`
>    - It atomically sets `lock->flag` to 1 and returns the old value (0)
>    - Thread A acquires the lock and enters the critical section
> 3. Thread B executes `atomic_exchange(&lock->flag, 1)`
>    - It atomically sets `lock->flag` to 1 (already 1) and returns the old value (1)
>    - Thread B spins, repeatedly trying the exchange
> 4. Thread A releases the lock by setting `lock->flag` to 0
> 5. On its next attempt, Thread B succeeds in acquiring the lock
> 
> ```
> Time  Thread A                 Thread B                 lock->flag

>  t5   [Exit critical section]
>  t6   exchange(&flag, 0)                                  0

> [!consider] Advantages and Limitations of Hardware-Supported Locks
> **Advantages:**
> - **Efficiency:** Hardware-supported operations are typically faster than software-only solutions
> - **Simplicity:** Easier to implement and reason about compared to complex software algorithms
> - **Scalability:** Can be easily extended to support multiple threads
> - **Portability:** Supported on most modern architectures
> 
> **Limitations:**
> - **Busy-waiting:** Still relies on spinning, which can waste CPU cycles
> - **Fairness:** No inherent guarantee of fairness (threads may starve)
> - **Contention:** High contention can lead to performance degradation
> 
> **Considerations:**
> - Many modern systems use more sophisticated locking mechanisms (e.g., futexes) that combine spinning with sleep/wake operations to reduce CPU usage
> - Understanding these basic hardware primitives is crucial for implementing higher-level synchronization constructs
