> [!idea] Futex: Fast Userspace muTEX
> Futex is a hybrid synchronization mechanism that combines userspace and kernel space operations for efficient locking.
> 
> **Key points:**
> - Starts with a fast userspace check (like spin lock)
> - Only enters kernel mode if contention is detected
> - Allows waiting threads to sleep, saving CPU cycles
> 
> **How it works:**
> 1. Check lock state in userspace (atomic operation)
> 2. If uncontended, acquire lock without kernel involvement
> 3. If contended, make a system call to sleep (kernel mode)
> 4. Kernel wakes up waiting threads when lock is released
> 
> **Benefits:**
> - Efficiency: Avoids unnecessary kernel mode transitions
> - Scalability: Performs well in both low and high contention
> - Flexibility: Can be used to implement various synchronization primitives
> 
> **Usage:**
> ```c
> int futex_value = 0;  // Shared in userspace
> 
> // Acquire
> while (atomic_compare_exchange(&futex_value, 0, 1) != 0) {
>     futex_wait(&futex_value, 1);  // Sleep if still locked
> }
> 
> // Release
> atomic_store(&futex_value, 0);
> futex_wake(&futex_value, 1);  // Wake one waiting thread
> ```
> 
> Futexes provide a best-of-both-worlds approach, combining the speed of userspace operations with the efficiency of kernel-managed sleeping when necessary.
