> [!idea] Comprehensive RAID Levels Comparison
> **Performance Metrics Explanation**:
> - N := number of disks
> - C := capacity of 1 disk
> - S := sequential throughput of 1 disk
> - R := random throughput of 1 disk
> - D := latency of one small I/O operation
> 
> **Comparison Table**:
> 
> | RAID Level | Capacity | Reliability | Read Latency | Write Latency | Seq Read | Seq Write | Rand Read | Rand Write |
> |------------|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
> | RAID 0 | N * C | Lowest | D | D | N * S | N * S | N * R | N * R |
> | RAID 1 | N/2 * C | Highest | D | D | N/2 * S | N/2 * S | N * R | N/2 * R |
> | RAID 4 | (N-1) * C | Medium | D | 2D | (N-1) * S | (N-1) * S | (N-1) * R | R/2 |
> | RAID 5 | (N-1) * C | Medium | D | 2D | (N-1) * S | (N-1) * S | N * R | N/4 * R |
> 
> **Reliability Notes**:
> - RAID 0: No fault tolerance, failure of any disk results in data loss
> - RAID 1: Can survive failure of N/2 disks
> - RAID 4 & 5: Can survive failure of 1 disk
> 
> **Key Observations**:
> 1. Capacity: RAID 0 offers the highest capacity utilization, while RAID 1 has the lowest
> 2. Reliability: RAID 1 provides the highest reliability, RAID 0 the lowest
> 3. Latency: Read latency is consistent across all levels, but write latency increases for RAID 4 and 5 due to parity calculations
> 4. Sequential Operations: RAID 0 offers the best performance, followed closely by RAID 4 and 5
> 5. Random Read: RAID 1 and RAID 5 perform best for random reads
> 6. Random Write: RAID 0 performs best, while RAID 4 has the poorest performance due to parity disk bottleneck
> 
> **Use Case Considerations**:
> - RAID 0: High performance, no data protection (temporary data, easily reproducible data)
> - RAID 1: Critical data requiring high reliability and read performance
> - RAID 4: Rarely used due to write performance limitations
> - RAID 5: General purpose, balancing performance, capacity, and redundancy

> [!consider] What Happened to RAID 2 and 3?
> RAID 2 and RAID 3 are rarely used in modern systems due to their limitations and the superiority of other RAID levels.
> 
> **RAID 2**:
> - Used bit-level striping with Hamming code for error correction
> - Required a specific number of disks (usually 7 or 15)
> - Became obsolete as disk controllers incorporated error correction
> 
> **RAID 3**:
> - Used byte-level striping with dedicated parity disk
> - Similar to RAID 4 but with finer granularity
> - Limited by single-threaded performance and parity disk bottleneck
> - RAID 4 and 5 proved more versatile and efficient for most use cases
> 
> Both RAID 2 and 3 were theoretically interesting but proved impractical for most real-world applications, leading to their obsolescence in favor of more efficient RAID levels.
