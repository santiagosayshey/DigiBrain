> [!motivation] File System Design
> Traditional Unix file systems treated disk drives like random-access memory, ignoring a fundamental principle: **locality matters for disk performance**. Related data, like files in the same directory, could be scattered across the disk. This meant frequent seek operations as the disk head moved between:
> - Directory entries and their inodes
> - Inodes and their data blocks
> - Sequential blocks of the same file
> 
> Disk drives achieve optimal performance with sequential access, performing 50-100 times faster than random access. **Two types of locality** significantly impact disk performance:
> - **Temporal Locality**: Files accessed together should be stored together
> - **Spatial Locality**: Sequential blocks should be physically adjacent
> 
> The mechanical constraints of disk drives - head movement and rotational delays - make this locality crucial. Each seek operation forces the disk head to physically move, introducing significant latency that could be avoided through better data organization.

> [!idea] Fast File System Structure
> FFS solves the locality problem through **cylinder groups** - regions of consecutive disk blocks that keep related data together. This design addresses both types of locality:
> - **Temporal Locality**: Files in the same directory are placed in the same cylinder group
> - **Spatial Locality**: Related data structures (inodes, data blocks) are kept physically close
> 
> **1. Cylinder Group Contents**
> As shown in the diagram, each cylinder group contains four strategically placed components:
> 
> - **Superblock**: Contains critical filesystem metadata
>   - Total number of blocks and inodes
>   - Block and fragment sizes
>   - Free block counts
> - **Inode Blocks**: Array of inodes kept close to their data
>   - Inodes for files in a directory stored in same group as directory
>   - Reduces seek time between metadata and data access
> - **Data Blocks**: File contents stored near their inodes
> - **Bitmap**: Tracks block/inode usage for efficient allocation

> **2. Block Management System**:
> Inside the "Data Blocks" region of each cylinder group, FFS manages space using two units of allocation:
> 
> | Storage Unit | Size | Purpose | Example |
> |------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
> | Full Block | 4-8KB | Basic unit of data storage. Used for: <br> - Large files<br> - Directories<br> - When sequential read/write performance matters | A 100KB file would use 25 full blocks (at 4KB/block) |
> | Fragment | 512B-1KB | Subdivision of a full block. Used for: <br> - Small files<br> - Final partial block of larger files<br> - Prevents wasting space | A 1.5KB config file uses 1 fragment instead of wasting a full 4KB block |
> 
> For example, storing a 6KB file with 4KB blocks:
> - First 4KB → 1 full block
> - Remaining 2KB → 2 fragments (assuming 1KB fragments)
> 
> **3. Index Structure**:
> The index structure provides efficient file access while maintaining locality:
> - Direct block pointers access first blocks quickly
> - Single indirect pointers for medium files
> - Double and triple indirect for large files
> - All pointer blocks stored near the data they reference
> 
> This entire structure ensures that related data stays physically close on disk, minimizing seek operations and maximizing performance.

> [!idea] FFS Implementation
> The FFS implementation enhances performance through strategic data organization and resource management. The superblock contains critical file system metadata, replicated across cylinder groups for reliability. Unlike traditional systems that use linked lists, FFS employs a bitmap in each cylinder group to track free blocks, enabling efficient space allocation.
> 
> **Cylinder Group Organization**:
> Each cylinder group maintains its own resource tracking and contains:
> 
> The superblock copy stores vital file system information:
> - Block and fragment size parameters
> - Total blocks and free blocks count
> - Inode allocation information
> - File system state flags
> 
> The inode table region holds file metadata entries:
> - Static allocation of 1% of total group space
> - Sequential inode numbering within groups
> - Pre-allocation strategy for future growth

> [!idea] Block Placement Strategy
> FFS employs sophisticated block placement algorithms to maximize disk performance. When allocating blocks for new files, the system attempts to preserve both spatial and temporal locality. 
> 
> **Directory Placement**:
> The system places new directories in cylinder groups based on:
> - Available free space above the group's mean
> - Number of existing directories below mean
> - Physical distance from parent directory's group
> 
> **File Block Allocation**:
> For regular files, FFS allocates blocks using a multi-tiered strategy:
> - First data block placement determines the file's "home" group
> - Subsequent blocks are allocated within the same group when possible
> - Large files receive blocks across multiple groups after exceeding the per-group quota
> - System maintains a rotational layout table for optimal block positioning

> [!example] FFS Operations
> Consider a file system with 4KB blocks and 512-byte fragments. When creating a new 6KB text file in /home/user/documents:
> 
> 1. Directory Operation:
> The system first locates the documents directory inode in its home group. The directory entry for the new file requires a block modification to add:
> - File name
> - Inode number
> - File type
> 
> 2. Resource Allocation:
> The file requires:
> - One complete block (4KB)
> - Four fragments (2KB)
> - One inode from the cylinder group
> 
> 3. Block Layout:
> ```
> Block 0: First 4KB of file data
> Fragments 0-3: Remaining 2KB of data
>   Fragment 0: 512 bytes
>   Fragment 1: 512 bytes
>   Fragment 2: 512 bytes
>   Fragment 3: 512 bytes (partially used)
> ```

> [!consider] Performance Implications
> The FFS design introduces several performance trade-offs that affect system behavior. The block size selection impacts both performance and space efficiency. Larger blocks improve sequential read performance but may increase internal fragmentation for small files.
> 
> **Space Management Considerations**:
> The fragment implementation addresses space efficiency:
> - Reduces internal fragmentation for small files
> - Increases management complexity
> - Requires additional metadata tracking
> 
> **Load Balancing Effects**:
> Cylinder group management affects overall system performance:
> - Groups maintain independent free block counts
> - Directory spreading prevents hot spots
> - Large file block spreading may increase seek times
> 
> **System Aging Impact**:
> As the file system ages, several factors affect performance:
> - Fragment free space becomes scattered
> - Directory structures grow and spread
> - Large files may experience increased fragmentation
> 
> The system implements several strategies to combat aging:
> - Regular block reallocation during quiet periods
> - Maintaining free space reserves in each group
> - Background optimization of file block layouts
