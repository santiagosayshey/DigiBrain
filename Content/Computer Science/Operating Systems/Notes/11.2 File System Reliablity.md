> [!motivation] File System Reliability
> File systems must **maintain data integrity despite various failure scenarios.** When a system crashes or loses power:
> - Write operations might be incomplete
> - Directory structures could become inconsistent
> - Inodes might reference invalid blocks
> - Blocks could be marked both used and free
> 
> These inconsistencies arise because file system updates require multiple disk writes. For example, creating a file involves:
> - Updating directory data
> - Allocating and writing inode
> - Updating bitmaps
> - Writing actual file data
> 
> A failure between any of these steps leaves the file system in an inconsistent state, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

> [!idea] File System Check (FSCK)
> FSCK provides recovery through post-crash consistency checking. It scans the entire filesystem, building an understanding of the actual disk state:
> 
> **Verification Passes**:
> 1. **Superblock**: Verifies basic parameters
>    - Block counts
>    - Inode counts
>    - Free block maps
> 
> 2. **Inode State**:
>    - Validates format and type
>    - Checks link counts
>    - Verifies size against block pointers
> 
> 3. **Directory Structure**:
>    - Ensures proper formatting
>    - Validates parent-child relationships
>    - Checks for cycles and unreachable directories
> 
> 4. **Link Counts**:
>    - Compares reference counts to actual links
>    - Adjusts counts or moves files to lost+found
> 
> 5. **Free Blocks**:
>    - Reconstructs free block map
>    - Identifies multiply-allocated blocks
>    - Resolves conflicts

> [!example] FSCK in Action
> Consider a system crash during file creation that leaves these inconsistencies:
> 
> **Initial State**:
> ```
> Directory Entry: new_file â†’ inode 67
> Inode 67: Marked allocated, points to blocks [100, 101]
> Bitmap: Block 100 marked used, 101 still marked free
> ```
> 
> **FSCK Recovery Process**:
> 1. **Superblock Scan**:
>    - Verifies filesystem parameters intact
>    - Confirms overall structure readable
> 
> 2. **Inode Check**:
>    ```
>    Found: Inode 67
>    - Status: Allocated
>    - Blocks: [100, 101]
>    - Issue: Block 101 marked free but claimed
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Resolution**:
>    - Marks block 101 as used in bitmap
>    - Updates checksums
>    - Logs correction in fsck output

> [!consider] FSCK Limitations
> While FSCK provides recovery, it has significant drawbacks:
> 
> **Performance Issues**:
> - Must scan entire filesystem
> - Runtime proportional to filesystem size
> - Can take hours on modern large disks
> 
> **Recovery Limitations**:
> - Cannot always determine correct state
> - May lose recent changes
> - Moves suspicious files to lost+found
> 
> **Operational Impact**:
> - Requires filesystem to be unmounted
> - Blocks system availability during check
> - Forces downtime after crashes
> 
> These limitations led to the development of journaling filesystems, which maintain a log of changes to enable faster, more reliable recovery.
