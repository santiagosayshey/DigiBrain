motivation - assuming modern systems use multi level index tables for a file system implementation, how do we actually store them virtually?

- idea - empty disk + data blocks
	- start with an empty disk
	- 2d array (represented by a markdown table) showing an example disk with multiple blocks. assume each block is 4KB
	- some blocks are used, some are not. 
	- 8 per row.

idea - inodes
- expand on this disk example
	- where do inodes fit into this?
	- how do they relate to the data
