> Operating systems use different strategies to virtualize the CPU:
> 
> 1. **Direct Execution**:
>    - OS creates process and transfers control to starting point (e.g., main())
>    - Allows user process to run directly on hardware
>    - Problems:
>      - No restrictions (could access files, read/write other process data)
>      - Process could run forever (if slow, buggy, or malicious)
>      - No way to handle slow operations (like I/O)
> 
> 2. **Limited Direct Execution**:
>    - A technique that allows processes to run directly on the CPU while maintaining OS control
>    - Introduces two CPU modes:
>      - **User mode**: For running application code with **restricted privileges**
>      - **Kernel mode**: For executing **privileged operations** and OS code
>    - Uses hardware support (e.g., protection modes, timer interrupts)
>    - Enables system calls for restricted operations (file access, I/O)
>    - Allows OS to regain control periodically and manage processes

> [!idea] The Kernel: Core OS Manager
> The kernel is the **central, privileged part of an operating system that manages and provides essential services.**
> 
> How it operates:
> 1. System starts in kernel mode
> 2. Kernel initializes hardware and core services
> 3. User process created, switches to user mode
> 4. When **process needs privileged operation** (e.g., I/O, memory allocation):
>    - Process makes system call
>    - **CPU switches to kernel mode**
>    - Kernel performs requested operation
>    - CPU returns to user mode, process continues
> 5. Kernel handles interrupts, switching to kernel mode as needed

> [!idea]- Virtual Environments and Containerization
> Building on the concepts of process isolation and resource management, modern systems have developed more advanced virtualization techniques:
> 
> **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
> - Emulate entire computer systems, including the OS
> - Provide strong isolation but with higher overhead
> 
> **Containers (e.g., Docker)**:
> - Lightweight, OS-level virtualization
> - Share the host OS kernel but isolate the application and its dependencies
> - Faster to start and more resource-efficient than VMs
> 
> **Container Orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)**:
> - Manages deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers
> - Automates container lifecycle across multiple hosts
> 
> These technologies extend the principles of process management and resource virtualization to create isolated, portable, and scalable application environments.
> 
> Key benefits:
> - Improved resource utilization
> - Enhanced application portability
> - Easier scaling and management of complex applications
> 
> While these technologies operate at a higher level than individual processes, they build upon the fundamental concepts of OS-level process and resource management.

> [!idea] Kernel Mode Transfers
> Various events can **trigger a transfer from user mode to kernel mode**. Here's a summary of key transfer mechanisms:
> 
> | Mechanism | Description | Typical Use Cases | Examples |
> |-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
> | System Call | User process **explicitly requests kernel** service (like a function call) | File operations, process creation, network access | `open()`, `fork()`, `socket()` |
> | Exception | **Unexpected event** occurs during process execution | Divide by zero, page fault, illegal instruction | Accessing unmapped memory, executing privileged instruction in user mode |
> | Interrupt | **External hardware event** signals the CPU | I/O completion, timer expiration, hardware failure | Keyboard press, network packet arrival, disk read completion |
> | Trap | **Intentional exception** used for debugging | Breakpoints, single-stepping through code | `int 3` instruction (x86), `bkpt` instruction (ARM) |
> 
> Each of these mechanisms:
> 1. Saves the current process state
> 2. Switches the CPU to kernel mode
> 3. Transfers control to a specific kernel routine
> 4. Returns to user mode upon completion (if applicable)
> 
> Understanding these transfer mechanisms is crucial for comprehending how the OS maintains control while allowing user processes to execute efficiently.
