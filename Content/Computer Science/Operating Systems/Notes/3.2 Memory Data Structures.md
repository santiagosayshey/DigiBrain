
> [!idea] Stacks and Heaps in Virtual Memory
> Within a program's virtual address space, memory is typically organized into stacks and heaps, each with distinct characteristics and interaction methods:
> 
> | Aspect | Stack | Heap |
> |--------|-------|------|
> | **Purpose** | Stores local variables, function parameters, return addresses | Stores dynamically allocated memory |
> | **Allocation** | Automatic, managed by compiler | Manual (in languages like C) or garbage-collected |
> | **Lifetime** | Short-lived, tied to function scope | Persists until explicitly freed or program ends |
> | **Size** | Fixed, determined at compile time | Flexible, can grow or shrink at runtime |
> | **Speed** | Fast allocation and deallocation | Slower allocation and deallocation |
> | **Order** | Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) | No specific order |
> | **Fragmentation** | No fragmentation | Can suffer from fragmentation |
> | **Typical usage** | Local variables, function calls | Objects, large data structures |
> | **Interaction** | At high level: automatic<br>At low level: assembly instructions (push, pop) | In code: functions like malloc(), free() (C)<br>Or new, delete (C++) |
> 
> **Key points:**
> - Stacks are managed automatically at the high level, but compiled code uses push/pop operations
> - Heap memory is explicitly managed in code using allocation and deallocation functions
> - Both exist within the program's virtual address space
> - The operating system manages the translation of these virtual addresses to physical memory locations
> - **Fragmentation:** Stacks avoid fragmentation due to their LIFO nature, while heaps can suffer from fragmentation due to random allocation and deallocation patterns


> [!example] Stack in Action
> Let's consider a simple C function call and how it affects the stack:
> 
> ```c
> int add(int a, int b) {
>     int result = a + b;
>     return result;
> }
> 
> int main() {
>     int x = 5;
>     int y = 3;
>     int sum = add(x, y);
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
> 
> Stack operations during execution:
> 
> 1. `main()` is called:
>    - Push return address
>    - Allocate space for `x` and `y`
> 
> 2. Before calling `add(x, y)`:
>    - Push parameters (y, then x) in reverse order
>    - Push return address
> 
> 3. Inside `add()`:
>    - Push old base pointer
>    - Move stack pointer to new base pointer
>    - Allocate space for `result`
> 
> 4. After `add()` completes:
>    - Return value stored in register
>    - Pop stack back to `main()`'s frame
>    - Store return value in `sum`
> 
> ```
> High memory addresses

> | return addr (main)|
> | y (3)             |
> | x (5)             |
> | return addr (add) |
> | old base pointer  |
> | result (8)        |

> This example shows how the stack grows and shrinks as functions are called and return, demonstrating its Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature and role in managing function execution.

> [!example] Memory Allocation in a C Function
> Consider this simple C function:
>
> ```c
> static int global_count = 0;
>
> void process_data(int* data, int size) {
>     static int call_count = 0;
>     int local_sum = 0;
>     int* dynamic_array = malloc(size * sizeof(int));
>
>     call_count++;
>     for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
>         local_sum += data[i];
>         dynamic_array[i] = data[i] * 2;
>     }
>     global_count += local_sum;
>
>     free(dynamic_array);
> }
> ```
>
> Memory allocation for various elements:
>
> | Element | Memory Location | Notes |
> |---------|-----------------|-------|
> | `global_count` | Data segment | Static global variable |
> | `process_data` | Text segment | Function code |
> | `call_count` | Data segment | Static local variable |
> | `data` | Stack | Pointer to input data |
> | `size` | Stack | Function parameter |
> | `local_sum` | Stack | Local variable |
> | `dynamic_array` | Stack | Pointer to heap memory |
> | `*dynamic_array` | Heap | Dynamically allocated array |
> | `i` | Stack | Loop counter |
>
> Key points:
> - Stack variables are deallocated when the function returns
> - Heap memory persists until explicitly freed
> - Static variables (global and local) persist throughout program execution
