> [!idea] Socket
> A socket is an **interface between an application and the network**, allowing data to be exchanged between applications running on different hosts.
>
> - Applications **pass data to a socket** for transmission over the network.
> - Applications **receive data from a socket** sent by another host on the network.
> 
> Sockets can be used with both **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**.
>
> | Feature | TCP Socket | UDP Socket |
> |---------|------------|------------|
> | Connection | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
> | Reliability | Reliable, ordered delivery | Unreliable, unordered delivery |
> | Data Boundary | Stream-based, no boundaries | Datagram-based, preserves boundaries |
> | Error Checking | Extensive error checking and recovery | Basic error checking, no recovery |
> | Usage | Reliable data transfer (e.g., web, email) | Fast, efficient data transfer (e.g., streaming, DNS) |

> [!idea] Ports
> Each host machine has an IP address, and each address has **65,536 ports**. These ports can be thought of as doors at an address, allowing multiple services to be hosted on a single machine.
> 
> Some ports are reserved for specific purposes:
> - Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access
> - Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System) for name resolution
> - Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web traffic
> - Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure web traffic
> 
> Reserving ports ensures that well-known services can be easily accessed and prevents conflicts between different applications.
> 
> A socket provides an **interface to send and receive data through a specific port**. By associating a socket with a port, applications can communicate with other hosts on the network using the appropriate protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP).

idea - bind
- associates (exclusively) reserve a port for use by a socket
- int status = bind(sockid, &addrport, size); explain this

idea - connection
- occurs between two ends, server waits for an active participant, client initiates connection request
- then, both can send / receive / terminate

idea - listen & accept
- 


> [!example] Socket Creation and Usage in C

> ```c
> // Create a socket
> int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol);
> 
> // Specify the address and port
> struct sockaddr_in server_address;
> server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
> server_address.sin_port = htons(port);
> server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(ip_address);
> 
> // Bind the socket to the address and port (for server)
> bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));
> 
> // Listen for incoming connections (for server)
> listen(sockfd, max_connections);
> 
> // Accept a client connection (for server)
> int clientfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&client_address, &client_address_length);
> 
> // Connect to the server (for client)
> connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_address, sizeof(server_address));
> 
> // Send data
> send(sockfd, data, data_length, flags);
> 
> // Receive data
> recv(sockfd, buffer, buffer_size, flags);
> 
> // Close the socket
> close(sockfd);

> The process involves:
> 1. Creating a socket with the appropriate domain, type, and protocol.
> 2. Specifying the address and port to bind the socket to (for server) or connect to (for client).
> 3. Listening for incoming connections (for server) and accepting client connections.
> 4. Sending and receiving data using `send()` and `recv()` functions.
> 5. Closing the socket when communication is complete.
