> [!idea] Socket
> A socket is an **interface between an application and the network**, allowing data to be exchanged between applications running on different hosts.
>
> - Applications **pass data to a socket** for transmission over the network.
> - Applications **receive data from a socket** sent by another host on the network.
> 
> Sockets can be used with both **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**.
>
> | Feature | TCP Socket | UDP Socket |
> |---------|------------|------------|
> | Connection | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
> | Reliability | Reliable, ordered delivery | Unreliable, unordered delivery |
> | Data Boundary | Stream-based, no boundaries | Datagram-based, preserves boundaries |
> | Error Checking | Extensive error checking and recovery | Basic error checking, no recovery |
> | Usage | Reliable data transfer (e.g., web, email) | Fast, efficient data transfer (e.g., streaming, DNS) |

> [!idea] Ports
> Each host machine has an IP address, and each address has **65,536 ports**. These ports can be thought of as doors at an address, allowing multiple services to be hosted on a single machine.
> 
> Some ports are reserved for specific purposes:
> - Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access
> - Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System) for name resolution
> - Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web traffic
> - Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure web traffic
> 
> Reserving ports ensures that well-known services can be easily accessed and prevents conflicts between different applications.
> 
> A socket provides an **interface to send and receive data through a specific port**. By associating a socket with a port, applications can communicate with other hosts on the network using the appropriate protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP).

> [!idea] Bind
> The `bind()` function associates (or exclusively reserves) a port for use by a socket.
> 
> ```c
> int status = bind(sockid, &addrport, size);
> ```
> 
> - `sockid`: The socket descriptor returned by the `socket()` function.
> - `&addrport`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr` containing the IP address and port number to bind to.
> - `size`: The size of the `struct sockaddr`.
> 
> The `bind()` function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

> [!idea] Connection
> A connection occurs between two endpoints: a server and a client.
> 
> - The server waits passively for an active participant to establish a connection.
> - The client initiates a connection request to the server.
> 
> Once the connection is established, both the server and the client can send and receive data, as well as terminate the connection.

> [!idea] Listen, Accept, and Connect
> The `listen()`, `accept()`, and `connect()` functions are used to establish connections between a server and a client.
> 
> ```c
> int status = listen(sock, queuelen);
> ```
> 
> - `sock`: The socket descriptor.
> - `queuelen`: The maximum number of pending connections that can be queued.
> 
> The `listen()` function prepares the server to accept incoming connection requests and specifies the maximum number of pending connections.
> 
> ```c
> int s = accept(sock, &addr, &addrlen);
> ```
> 
> - `sock`: The listening socket descriptor.
> - `&addr`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr` to store the client's address information.
> - `&addrlen`: A pointer to the size of the `struct sockaddr`.
> 
> The `accept()` function is non-blocking and returns a new socket descriptor for the accepted client connection.
> 
> ```c
> int status = connect(sock, &addr, addrlen);
> ```
> 
> - `sock`: The socket descriptor.
> - `&addr`: A pointer to a `struct sockaddr` containing the server's address information.
> - `addrlen`: The size of the `struct sockaddr`.
> 
> The `connect()` function is blocking and establishes a connection to the specified server address. It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

> [!idea] Write and Send
> The `write()` and `send()` functions are used to send data through a socket.
> 
> ```c
> ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
> ```
> 
> - `fd`: The file descriptor (socket) to write to.
> - `*buf`: A pointer to the buffer containing the data to be written.
> - `count`: The number of bytes to write.
> 
> The `write()` function attempts to write `count` bytes from the buffer pointed to by `buf` to the file descriptor `fd`. It returns the number of bytes actually written, or -1 on error.
> 
> ```c
> int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags);
> ```
> 
> - `sockfd`: The socket descriptor.
> - `*msg`: A pointer to the buffer containing the message to be sent.
> - `len`: The length of the message in bytes.
> - `flags`: Additional options (e.g., `MSG_OOB` for out-of-band data).
> 
> The `send()` function is similar to `write()` but provides additional options through the `flags` argument. It returns the number of bytes sent, or -1 on error.

> [!idea] Read and Recv
> The `read()` and `recv()` functions are used to receive data from a socket.
> 
> ```c
> ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
> ```
> 
> - `fd`: The file descriptor (socket) to read from.
> - `*buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the read data will be stored.
> - `count`: The maximum number of bytes to read.
> 
> The `read()` function attempts to read `count` bytes from the file descriptor `fd` into the buffer pointed to by `buf`. It returns the number of bytes actually read, 0 if end-of-file is reached, or -1 on error.
> 
> ```c
> int recv(int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags);
> ```
> 
> - `sockfd`: The socket descriptor.
> - `*buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the received data will be stored.
> - `len`: The maximum number of bytes to receive.
> - `flags`: Additional options (e.g., `MSG_PEEK` to peek at incoming data).
> 
> The `recv()` function is similar to `read()` but provides additional options through the `flags` argument. It returns the number of bytes received, 0 if the connection is closed, or -1 on error.

> int sockfd = socket(domain, type, protocol);
> 
> // Specify the address and port
> struct sockaddr_in server_address;
> server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;

> // Listen for incoming connections (for server)
> listen(sockfd, max_connections);
> 
> // Accept a client connection (for server)

> The process involves:
> 1. Creating a socket with the appropriate domain, type, and protocol.
> 2. Specifying the address and port to bind the socket to (for server) or connect to (for client).

> 5. Closing the socket when communication is complete.

> [!consider] Adding Concurrency to Sockets
> To handle multiple clients concurrently, we can use either threads or non-blocking I/O with `select()`.
> 
> 1. **Threads**: 
>    - Create a new thread for each client connection.
>    - Each thread handles communication with its assigned client independently.
>    - Relatively easy to implement and understand.
>    - Potential for race conditions if shared resources are not properly synchronized.
> 
> 2. **Non-blocking I/O with `select()`**:
>    - Use `select()` to monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets) for activity.
>    - Set the sockets to non-blocking mode using `fcntl()`.
>    - Loop through the sockets and handle ready events (incoming connections, data to read/write).
>    - No race conditions since a single thread manages all connections.
>    - More complex to implement compared to the threaded approach.
> 
> | Approach | Pros | Cons |
> |----------|------|------|
> | Threads | - Easy to implement<br>- Straightforward to understand<br>- Handles each client independently | - Potential for race conditions<br>- Requires synchronization for shared resources<br>- Overhead of creating and managing threads |
> | Non-blocking I/O with `select()` | - No race conditions<br>- Single thread manages all connections<br>- Scalable to handle many clients | - More complex to implement<br>- Requires careful management of file descriptors<br>- May require additional event loop logic |
> 
> Ultimately, the choice between threads and non-blocking I/O depends on factors such as the expected number of clients, the complexity of the application, and the developer's familiarity with each approach.
