please help me write my intro note to concurrency

motivation - so far we've only considered machines with single processes that run from start to finish. What if we want to introduce concurrency? ie, multiple CPU threads, cores, etc. threads that interleave with each other to form processes. How can we do this on an instruction level to give control to the programmer?
