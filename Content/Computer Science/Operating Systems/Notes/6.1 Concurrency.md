please help me write my intro note to concurrency. please expand on it where you deem it nessecary.

motivation - so far we've only considered machines with single processes that run from start to finish. What if we want to introduce concurrency? ie, multiple CPU threads, cores, etc. threads that interleave with each other to form processes. How can we do this on an instruction level to give control to the programmer?

consider - how do we ensure correctness?
- balance = balance + 1, what does this mean?
- instructions accessing shared memory need to be atomic - they must execute as an uninterruptable group
- what does this actually mean?
	- we need mutual exclusion
	- if process A is in critical section B, then process C can't also be in critical section B
