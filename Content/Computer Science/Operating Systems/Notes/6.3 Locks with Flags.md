> [!idea]+ Implementing Locks with Load and Store Instructions
> A more common and flexible approach to implementing locks is using load and store instructions, also known as locks with flags. This method relies on special atomic instructions provided by the processor to ensure mutual exclusion. Here's how it works:
>
> 1. **A lock is represented by a flag variable, typically an integer, which is initially set to 0 (unlocked state).**
> 2. When a thread wants to acquire the lock, it performs an atomic "test and set" operation on the flag variable. This operation atomically **reads the current value of the flag and sets it to 1 (locked state) in a single, indivisible step.**
> 3. If the previous value of the flag was 0, it means the lock was previously unlocked, and the thread successfully acquires the lock and enters the critical section.
> 4. If the previous value of the flag was already 1, it means another thread already holds the lock, and the current thread must wait (either by busy-waiting or blocking) until the lock becomes available.
> 5. When a thread exits the critical section, it atomically sets the flag back to 0 (unlocked state) using a store instruction, allowing other threads to acquire the lock.
>
> Here's some C pseudocode to illustrate this concept:
>
> ```c
> typedef struct {
>     int flag;  // 0 = unlocked, 1 = locked
> } lock_t;
>
> // Assume this function exists and performs an atomic test-and-set operation
> int test_and_set(int* target);
>
> void acquire_lock(lock_t* lock) {
>     while (test_and_set(&lock->flag) == 1) {
>         ; // Busy-wait (spin) while the lock is held by another thread
>     }
>     // Lock acquired, enter critical section
> }
>
> void release_lock(lock_t* lock) {
>     lock->flag = 0;  // Release the lock
> }
>
> // Usage
> lock_t my_lock = {0};  // Initialize lock
> acquire_lock(&my_lock);
> // Perform critical section operations
> release_lock(&my_lock);
> ```

> Advantages of using load and store instructions for locks:
> - Atomicity: The test and set operation is performed atomically, ensuring that **only one thread can acquire the lock at a time.**
> - Flexibility: Load and store locks can be used in both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems, as they rely on atomic instructions provided by the processor.
> - Compatibility: Most modern processors provide atomic instructions, making this approach widely applicable.
