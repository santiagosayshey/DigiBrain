> [!idea] RAID 0: Striping
> RAID 0 uses striping to **optimize for capacity and performance**, with no redundancy:
> 
> - **Striping**: The process of **dividing data into smaller units (strips) and distributing them across multiple disks**.
>   - Each strip is typically a fixed size (e.g., 64KB or 128KB)
>   - Allows parallel read/write operations, potentially improving performance
> 
> - **Goal**: Maximize usable capacity and improve performance
> 
> - **No Redundancy**: 
>   - All available storage is used for data (no space used for redundancy)
>   - Failure of any disk results in complete data loss
>   - **Less reliable than JBOD**, as failure of any disk affects all data
> 
> **Physical to Logical Block Mapping**:
> - Logical blocks are mapped to physical blocks in alternating sequence across disks

> [!example] RAID 0 in Action
> Consider a RAID 0 setup with two 1TB disks:
> 
> - **Total Capacity**: 2TB (1TB + 1TB)
> - **Usable Capacity**: 2TB (100% of total capacity)
> - **Striping**: Assuming a 64KB strip size
> 
> **Scenario**: Writing a 256KB file
> 
> 1. The file is divided into four 64KB strips
> 2. Strips are written in parallel:
>    - Strip 1 & 3 to Disk 1
>    - Strip 2 & 4 to Disk 2
> 
> **Performance Impact**:
> - **Read/Write Speed**: Potentially doubled, as both disks operate simultaneously
> - **Theoretical Max Throughput**: Sum of individual disk throughputs
> 
> **Reliability Consideration**:
> - If either disk fails, the entire 256KB file is lost, along with all other data in the array
