> [!idea] RAID 0: Striping
> RAID 0 uses striping to **optimize for capacity and performance**, with no redundancy:
> 
> - **Striping**: The process of **dividing data into smaller units (strips) and distributing them across multiple disks**.
>   - Each strip is typically a fixed size (e.g., 64KB or 128KB)
>   - Allows parallel read/write operations, potentially improving performance
> 
> - **Goal**: Maximize usable capacity and improve performance
> 
> - **No Redundancy**: 
>   - All available storage is used for data (no space used for redundancy)
>   - Failure of any disk results in complete data loss
>   - **Less reliable than JBOD**, as failure of any disk affects all data
> 
> **Physical to Logical Block Mapping**:
> - Logical blocks are mapped to physical blocks in alternating sequence across disks

> [!idea] RAID 0 Analysis
> **Capacity**: 
> - Total capacity: $C = n * c$
>   - $n$ = number of disks
>   - $c$ = capacity of one disk
> 
> **Fault Tolerance**:
> - Disks that can fail without data loss: 0
> - Probability of data loss: $1 - (1 - p)^n$
>   - $p$ = probability of single disk failure
> 
> **Latency**:
> - Read: $L_r \approx L_{disk}$
> - Write: $L_w \approx L_{disk}$
>   - $L_{disk}$ = latency of a single disk
> 
> **Throughput**:
> - Sequential read: $T_{sr} \approx n * t_{disk}$
> - Sequential write: $T_{sw} \approx n * t_{disk}$
> - Random read: $T_{rr} \approx n * t_{disk}$
> - Random write: $T_{rw} \approx n * t_{disk}$
>   - $t_{disk}$ = throughput of a single disk
> 
> **Key Points**:
> - Highest capacity utilization (100%)
> - No fault tolerance (failure of any disk causes total data loss)
> - Improved throughput for all operations
> - Latency similar to single disk operations

> [!example] RAID 0 in Action
> Consider a RAID 0 setup with two 1TB disks:
> 
> - **Total Capacity**: 2TB (1TB + 1TB)
> - **Usable Capacity**: 2TB (100% of total capacity)
> - **Striping**: Assuming a 64KB strip size
> 
> **Scenario**: Writing a 256KB file
> 
> 1. The file is divided into four 64KB strips
> 2. Strips are written in parallel:
>    - Strip 1 & 3 to Disk 1
>    - Strip 2 & 4 to Disk 2
> 
> **Performance Impact**:
> - **Read/Write Speed**: Potentially doubled, as both disks operate simultaneously
> - **Theoretical Max Throughput**: Sum of individual disk throughputs
> 
> **Reliability Consideration**:
> - If either disk fails, the entire 256KB file is lost, along with all other data in the array

> [!example] RAID 0 Disk and Offset Calculation Example
> Given:
> - RAID 0 array with 4 disks
> - Strip size: 64KB
> - Logical address: 0x1A0000 (1,703,936 in decimal)
>   
> To find the disk and offset for the logical address:
> 1. Calculate the logical stripe number:
>    - Logical stripe number = Logical address ÷ Strip size
>    - 0x1A0000 ÷ 65536 (64KB) = 26
> 
> 2. Determine the physical disk:
>    - Physical disk = Logical stripe number % Number of disks
>    - 26 % 4 = 2
>    - The data is on Disk 2
> 
> 3. Calculate the physical offset within the disk:
>    - Physical offset = (Logical stripe number ÷ Number of disks) × Strip size
>    - (26 ÷ 4) × 65536 = 0x40000 (425,984 in decimal)
>    - The offset within Disk 2 is 0x40000
>
> So, for logical address 0x1A0000 in this RAID 0 setup, the data is located on Disk 2 at offset 0x40000.
>
> This example demonstrates how RAID 0 distributes data across disks based on the stripe siz, allowing for parallel access but providing no redundancy.
