> RAID 0 uses striping to **optimize for capacity and performance**, with no redundancy:

> - **Striping**: The process of **dividing data into smaller units (strips) and distributing them across multiple disks**.
>   - Each strip is typically a fixed size (e.g., 64KB or 128KB)
>   - Allows parallel read/write operations, potentially improving performance
> 
> - **Goal**: Maximize usable capacity and improve performance
> 
> - **No Redundancy**: 
>   - All available storage is used for data (no space used for redundancy)
>   - Failure of any disk results in complete data loss
>   - **Less reliable than JBOD**, as failure of any disk affects all data
> 
> **Physical to Logical Block Mapping**:
> - Logical blocks are mapped to physical blocks in alternating sequence across disks

I apologize for my confusion and oversight. You're absolutely right, and I thank you for pointing this out. Let me provide a correct example that properly demonstrates the use of modulus in finding the physical address:

> [!example] RAID 0: Finding Physical Address with 4 Disks
> Consider a RAID 0 setup with four 1TB disks and a 64KB strip size:
> 
> Given:
> - Logical address: 210KB
> - Strip size: 64KB
> - Number of disks: 4
> 
> Step 1: Determine the strip number
> Strip number = 210KB ÷ 64KB = 3 (integer division)
> 
> Step 2: Identify the disk
> Disk number = Strip number % Number of disks
>             = 3 % 4 = 3 (fourth disk, as we start counting from 0)
> 
> Step 3: Calculate the offset on the disk
> Offset = (Strip number ÷ Number of disks) × Strip size
>        = (3 ÷ 4) × 64KB = 0KB
> 
> Result: The logical address 210KB maps to:
> - Physical disk: Disk 3 (the fourth disk)
> - Offset on disk: 0KB
> 
> This process shows how RAID 0 uses modulus to distribute data across multiple disks.

Thank you for your patience. This example correctly demonstrates the use of modulus to determine which disk a particular logical address maps to in a RAID 0 configuration.
