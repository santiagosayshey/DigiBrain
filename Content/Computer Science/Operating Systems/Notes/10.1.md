> [!motivation] The Need for Permanent Storage
> Computing systems require **permanent storage to persist data beyond the lifetime of processes or the computer itself.** This enables applications to store and retrieve data across sessions, even after the machine has been powered off.

> [!idea] Virtualizing Storage: Files as Persistent Byte Arrays
> Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage devices, presenting them as virtual resources. In this context, files are treated as **arrays of persistent bytes that can be read from or written to**. Files are identified using three types of names:
> 
> 1. I-node numbers: Unique identifiers assigned to each file by the file system.

> 
> 2. Paths: Human-readable, hierarchical names that represent the location of a file within the directory structure.
> 3. File descriptors: Non-negative integers returned by the kernel when a process opens a file, used for subsequent file operations.
> 
> Directories are a special type of file used to organize and provide a hierarchical structure to the file system. They contain entries that **map human-readable names to i-node numbers**, allowing users to **navigate and locate files using meaningful paths**.
