I apologize for the misinterpretation. Here's the revised motivation callout focusing on the general need for permanent storage:

> [!motivation] The Need for Permanent Storage
> In computing systems, there is a fundamental need for permanent storage to persist data beyond the lifetime of processes or even the computer itself. Many applications require the ability to store and retrieve data across multiple sessions or after the machine has been powered off. Without permanent storage, all data would be lost when a program terminates or the computer shuts down, making it impossible to save progress, store configurations, or maintain long-term records. This highlights the importance of having reliable and efficient storage mechanisms to enable the persistence of data.
