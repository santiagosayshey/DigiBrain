> [!motivation] Data Integrity During Power Loss
> In computing systems, unexpected power losses can lead to data corruption or loss. This issue is particularly critical for:
> - Large-scale data centers
> - Mission-critical applications
> - Systems handling sensitive information
> There's a need for robust storage solutions that can maintain data integrity even when power is suddenly cut off.

> [!idea] Storage Virtualization
> Storage virtualization abstracts physical storage from the systems accessing it. Key components:
> 
> Files:
> - Arrays of persistent bytes for reading/writing
> - Three naming types:
>   1. inode numbers
>   2. Paths
>   3. File descriptors
> 
> Directories:
> - Organizational structures in filesystems
> - Map human-readable names to file identifiers
> - Contain entries for files and subdirectories
> - Enable hierarchical organization of data
