> [!motivation] Motivation for Banker's Algorithm
> In concurrent systems, resource allocation must be managed carefully to prevent deadlocks. Simple strategies like "acquire all resources at once" or "release on failure" can be inefficient or impractical. We need a method that:
> - Allows dynamic resource allocation
> - Maintains system safety (avoiding deadlock)
> - Maximizes resource utilization
> - Handles complex resource requirements
> 
> The Banker's Algorithm, inspired by banking practices, provides a solution to this challenge by simulating resource allocation before actually granting resources.

> [!idea] Banker's Algorithm
> The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that decides whether allocating resources to a process is safe or not.
> 
> Key Concepts:
> - **Safe State**: A state where the system can allocate resources to each process in some order and still avoid deadlock.
> - **Available Resources**: The number of available resources of each type.
> - **Maximum Demand**: The maximum number of resources a process may need.
> - **Allocated Resources**: The number of resources currently allocated to each process.
> - **Need**: The remaining resources that a process may still request.
> 
> Algorithm Steps:
> 1. Initialize the system state (available resources, maximum demand, allocated resources).
> 2. Calculate the need matrix (Need = Maximum Demand - Allocated).
> 3. For each resource request:
>    a. Check if the request exceeds the need. If so, raise an error.
>    b. Check if the request exceeds available resources. If so, the process must wait.
>    c. Tentatively allocate the requested resources.
>    d. Check if the resulting state is safe:
>       - Try to find a process whose needs can be met with available resources.
>       - If found, simulate execution of this process and add its resources to available.
>       - Repeat until all processes are done or no safe process is found.
>    e. If the state is safe, actually allocate the resources. Otherwise, revert and make the process wait.
> 
> Advantages:
> - Prevents deadlocks while allowing dynamic resource allocation.
> - Maximizes resource utilization compared to simpler strategies.
> - Provides a systematic way to evaluate system safety.
> 
> Disadvantages:
> - Requires knowing the maximum resource needs in advance.
> - Can be computationally expensive for large systems.
> - May lead to lower resource utilization in some cases due to conservative allocation.

> This example demonstrates how the Banker's Algorithm prevents deadlock by maintaining a safe state, even when resources are scarce. L3's request is denied because granting it would lead to an unsafe state, potentially causing deadlock.


```c
// MUTEX
mutex m;
wait(m);        // Take mutex or block
do_work();
signal(m);      // Release mutex

// CONDITION VAR
mutex m; cond c;
wait(m);        // Take mutex
while(!ready)   // Need condition true
   wait(c);     // Give up mutex & wait
do_work();      // Have mutex & ready=true
signal(m);

// SEMAPHORE  
sem = 2;        // Allow 2 threads
wait(sem);      // Decrement (block if 0)
use_resource();
signal(sem);    // Increment, wake one
```
