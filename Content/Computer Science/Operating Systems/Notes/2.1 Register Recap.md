> [!idea] Nand2Tetris Registers Recap
> The Nand2Tetris architecture uses a **minimalist set of registers**:
> 
> | Register | Purpose |
> |----------|---------|
> | A        | Address/Data: Holds memory address or data value |
> | D        | Data: General-purpose data storage |
> | M        | Memory: Represents memory at address stored in A |
> 
> **Key points:**
> - **A register**: Used for both addressing and data operations
> - **D register**: Primary register for arithmetic and logical operations
> - **M pseudo-register**: Not a physical register, but represents *M[A]*
> 
> **Examples:**
> ```assembly
> @100    // Load value 100 into A register
> D=A     // Copy value from A to D
> @200    // Load address 200 into A
> M=D     // Store D's value into memory at address 200
> ```
> 
> ```assembly
> @R0     // Set A to address of R0 (RAM[0])
> D=M     // D = contents of RAM[0]
> @R1     // Set A to address of R1 (RAM[1])
> D=D+M   // D = D + contents of RAM[1]
> @R2     // Set A to address of R2 (RAM[2])
> M=D     // RAM[2] = D (sum of R0 and R1)
> ```
> 
> This simplified design focuses on core computing concepts, providing a foundation for understanding more complex architectures like x86.


> [!idea] x86 Registers: Building on Nand2Tetris Concepts
> Registers in x86, like in Nand2Tetris, are **fast storage locations within the CPU for quick data access and manipulation**.
> 
> **Parallels and Expansions:**
> 1. **General-Purpose Registers:**
>    - Nand2Tetris: D register
>    - x86: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX (more specialized roles)
> 
> 2. **Address Register:**
>    - Nand2Tetris: A register
>    - x86: No direct equivalent, but ESI and EDI used for memory operations
> 
> 3. **Memory Access:**
>    - Nand2Tetris: M (memory access through A)
>    - x86: More complex addressing modes, often using combinations of registers
> 
> 4. **New Concepts in x86:**
>    - Stack management: ESP (Stack Pointer), EBP (Base Pointer)
>    - Specialized roles in system calls
> 
> Key x86 registers and their roles:
> 
> | Register | Role | Parallel to Nand2Tetris |
> |----------|------|--------------------------|
> | EAX      | Accumulator, syscall number/return value | Similar to D for arithmetic |
> | EBX      | Base, often 1st syscall argument | General data storage like D |
> | ECX      | Counter, often 2nd syscall argument | General data storage like D |
> | EDX      | Data, often 3rd syscall argument | General data storage like D |
> | ESI, EDI | Source/Destination Index | Complex version of A for addressing |
> | EBP      | Base Pointer (stack frame management) | No direct parallel |
> | ESP      | Stack Pointer | No direct parallel |
> 
> This expanded register set allows for more complex operations and memory management, building on the foundational concepts introduced in Nand2Tetris.

> [!example] Common x86 Assembly Instructions
> | Instruction | Syntax | Description | Example |
> |-------------|--------|-------------|---------|
> | movl | `movl <source>, <destination>` | Moves a 32-bit value between registers or memory | `movl $5, %eax` moves the value 5 into EAX register |
> | push | `push <source>` | Pushes a value onto the stack | `push %ebx` pushes the value in EBX onto the stack |
> | pop | `pop <destination>` | Removes the top value from the stack | `pop %ecx` pops the top stack value into ECX |
> | call | `call <function>` | Calls a function, pushing the return address onto the stack | `call printf` calls the printf function |
> | ret | `ret` | Returns from a function call | `ret` returns to the calling function |
> | int | `int <interrupt number>` | Generates a software interrupt | `int $0x80` generates interrupt 0x80 (used for system calls in Linux) |
> | jmp | `jmp <label>` | Unconditional jump to a memory address | `jmp loop_start` jumps to the loop_start label |
> | cmp | `cmp <operand1>, <operand2>` | Compares two values, setting flags | `cmp %eax, %ebx` compares EAX and EBX |
> | add | `add <source>, <destination>` | Adds the source to the destination | `add $1, %ecx` increments ECX by 1 |
> 
> **Register Prefixes:**
> - `%` denotes a register (e.g., `%eax`, `%ebx`)
> - `$` denotes an immediate value (e.g., `$5`, `$0x80`)
> 
> **Memory Access:**
> - `()` used for indirect addressing (e.g., `(%esp)` accesses memory at the address in ESP)
> - Offset can be added: `4(%esp)` accesses memory at ESP + 4
> 
> **Example: System Call Setup**
> ```x86asm
> movl $4, %eax    # System call number for write()
> movl $1, %ebx    # File descriptor (1 for stdout)
> movl $msg, %ecx  # Pointer to the message
> movl $13, %edx   # Message length
> int $0x80        # Trigger system call
> ```
> This example sets up registers for a write() system call and then triggers it using the int instruction.
