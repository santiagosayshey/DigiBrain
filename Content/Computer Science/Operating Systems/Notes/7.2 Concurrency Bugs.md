> [!example] Simple Concurrency Bug: Race Condition
> Consider this C++ code demonstrating a race condition:
> 
> ```cpp
> int shared_counter = 0;
> 
> void increment_counter() {
>     for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
>         shared_counter++;  // This operation is not atomic
>     }
> }
> 
> int main() {
>     std::thread t1(increment_counter);
>     std::thread t2(increment_counter);
>     
>     t1.join();
>     t2.join();
>     
>     std::cout << "Final counter value: " << shared_counter << std::endl;
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
> 
> This code has a race condition because:
> - Two threads concurrently access and modify `shared_counter`
> - The increment operation (`shared_counter++`) is not atomic
> - It consists of three steps: read, increment, write back
> - These steps can be interleaved between threads, leading to lost updates
> 
> Expected result: 2,000,000
> Actual result: Unpredictable, but likely less than 2,000,000

> [!idea] Therac-25 Concurrency Bug
> The Therac-25 radiation therapy machine had a critical concurrency bug in its control software:
> 
> - **Hardware Configuration**: 
>   - Two modes: low-power electron beam, high-power X-ray
>   - Mode selection involved moving a physical turntable
> 
> - **Software Control**:
>   - Multitasking operating system
>   - One task for user interface, another for machine setup
>   - **Key Bug**: Race condition between these tasks
> 
> - **Race Condition Details**:
>   - UI task set treatment variables (including mode)
>   - Machine setup task read these variables to configure hardware
>   - **Critical Flaw**: No proper synchronization between tasks
> 
> - **Failure Scenario**:
>   1. Operator rapidly edited treatment data
>   2. UI task updated variables faster than setup task could process
>   3. Setup task missed mode change, leaving turntable in X-ray position
>   4. Machine fired high-power X-rays without protective turntable
> 
> - **Contributing Factors**:
>   - Reuse of older, single-tasking software in a multitasking environment
>   - Overreliance on software for safety checks
>   - Insufficient testing of concurrent operations
> 
> - **Consequences**:
>   - Machine delivered massive radiation overdoses
>   - Resulted in severe injuries and deaths
> 
> This incident highlights the critical importance of proper synchronization in concurrent systems, especially in safety-critical applications.
