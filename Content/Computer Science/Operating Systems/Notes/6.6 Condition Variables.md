> [!motivation] Motivation
> In multithreaded programs, **locks solve mutual exclusion and race conditions** by ensuring that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. However, locks alone **do not address the need for specific ordering of thread execution**. 
> 
> Consider a scenario where we want **process B to run only after process A has completed a certain task**. This requires a mechanism to **allow threads to signal each other and wait for specific conditions** to be met before proceeding.
> 
> Condition variables and semaphores provide a solution to this problem of thread synchronization and ordering.

> [!idea] Condition Variables
> A condition variable is a synchronization primitive that **allows threads to wait for a specific condition to be met before continuing execution**. It is always used in conjunction with a mutex lock.
> 
> - Threads can wait on a condition variable, effectively putting themselves to sleep until they are awakened by another thread.
> - When a thread modifies the shared state in a way that might satisfy the condition, it can signal or broadcast the condition variable to wake up waiting threads.
> - Upon being awakened, the waiting threads reacquire the associated mutex lock and recheck the condition to ensure it is truly met before proceeding.
