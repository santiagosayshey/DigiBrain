motivation - adress space translation is demanding. it needs a lot of attention to make computers run as well as they do. its important that we optimise these things.

idea - clock algorithm extensions
- replace multiple pages at once
- last chance - add software counter to keep track of time since last used (a minute hand essentially)

idea - eviction extensions
- use dirty bit to give retention preference to dirty pages
- essentially avoiding pages that have changed to avoid needing to write them to disk (less overhead)

idea - write back list

idea - demand zero list


consider - global vs local replacement
- what if a victim page belongs to two processes?
	- fixed space
	- variable space


idea- thrashing
- more memory needed than available
- symptoms?
- how to improve?
