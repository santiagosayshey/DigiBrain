> [!motivation] Motivation
> Condition variables enable concurrency by allowing one process to signal another, determining execution order. However, they require manual state management by the programmer. For instance:
> ```cpp
> mutex mtx; 
> condition_variable cv;
> bool ready = false;
> 
> // Process 1
> {
>     unique_lock\<mutex> lck(mtx);
>     ready = true;
>     cv.notify_one();
> }
> 
> // Process 2 
> {
>     unique_lock\<mutex> lck(mtx);
>     while (!ready) {
>         cv.wait(lck);
>     }
>     // Do something after Process 1
> }
> ```
> Here, the `ready` flag must be manually set and checked to coordinate the processes. This state management can become complex and error-prone in larger systems. A higher-level synchronization primitive that encapsulates state could simplify concurrent programming and reduce bugs.
