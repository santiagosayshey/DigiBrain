> [!idea] Kernel Device Structure
> The kernel manages system resources through a two-layer device structure:
>
> 1. **System Call Interface**: Provides high-level abstractions and APIs for user-space applications.
>    - Includes process management, memory management, file systems, device control, and networking.
>
> 2. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Interfaces with actual hardware devices.
>    - Includes architecture-dependent code, memory manager, file system implementations, block devices, and device drivers.
>
> This modular structure allows for extensibility and maintains a consistent interface for user-space applications.

> [!idea] Device Drivers
> Device drivers facilitate communication between the OS and hardware devices by:
>
> 1. **Hardware Abstraction**: Presenting a standardized interface to the kernel.
> 2. **Device-Specific Functionality**: Tailored to the requirements and capabilities of the managed device.
> 3. **Interrupt Handling**: Servicing interrupts generated by hardware devices.
> 4. **Power Management**: Optimizing system energy consumption.
> 5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handling errors and exceptions.
>
> Examples: NIC drivers, GPU drivers, USB drivers, audio drivers, printer drivers.

> [!example] Life Cycle of an I/O Request

> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[User Program] --> |System Call| B[Kernel I/O Subsystem]
>     B --> |Request| C[Device Driver Top Half]
>     C --> |Command| E[Device Hardware]
>     E --> |Interrupt| D[Device Driver Bottom Half]
>     D --> |Result| B
>     B --> |Result| A

>
> 1. User program initiates I/O request via system call.
> 2. Kernel I/O subsystem prepares request for device driver.
> 3. Device driver top half validates request and issues commands to device hardware.
> 4. Device hardware processes I/O request independently.
> 5. Device hardware generates interrupt upon completion.
> 6. Device driver bottom half (ISR) reads result from device hardware and prepares it for the kernel.
> 7. Kernel I/O subsystem processes result for user program.
> 8. User program receives the result, completing the I/O request life cycle.

> [!consider] Goal of the I/O Subsystem: Providing a Uniform Interface
> The I/O subsystem **aims to provide a uniform interface for diverse devices**, abstracting device-specific details and presenting a standardized API. This simplifies device driver development and allows efficient device management.
>
> Examples:
> - Block devices (disk drives, SSDs) are controlled using the same code, despite differences in storage technology.
> - Character devices (keyboards, mice) are treated as generic input devices, regardless of communication protocols.
> - Network devices (Ethernet cards, Wi-Fi adapters) are managed through a common network stack, irrespective of the underlying hardware.

> [!consider] Timing and User Interaction with I/O Operations
> When performing I/O operations, the time taken to complete a request can vary significantly. Users can handle this waiting time using three approaches:
>
> 1. **Blocking I/O**: 
>    - The program issues an I/O request and waits until the operation is complete.
>    - The program's execution is suspended, which can lead to poor performance if it spends a significant amount of time waiting for I/O.
>
> 2. **Non-blocking I/O**:
>    - The program issues an I/O request and immediately continues execution without waiting for completion.
>    - The program can check the status of the I/O request later to determine if it has finished.
>    - This approach allows the program to perform other tasks concurrently but introduces complexity due to periodic status checks.
>
> 3. **Asynchronous I/O**:
>    - The program issues an I/O request and specifies a callback function to be invoked upon completion.
>    - The program continues execution, allowing it to perform other tasks while the I/O operation is in progress.
>    - When the I/O operation is complete, the system invokes the callback function to notify the program and provide the results.
>
> The choice of approach depends on the program's requirements and the nature of the I/O operations involved. Blocking I/O is suitable for simple scenarios, while non-blocking and asynchronous I/O are preferable when concurrent execution is desired.
>
> **Example: Recommended I/O Approach for Specific Devices**
>
> | Device Type | Recommended I/O Approach | Rationale |
> |-------------|--------------------------|-----------|
> | Hard Disk Drive | Asynchronous I/O | Disk I/O operations can be slow, so using asynchronous I/O allows the program to continue execution while the I/O is in progress. |
> | Solid-State Drive (SSD) | Non-blocking I/O | SSDs are faster than traditional hard drives, so non-blocking I/O can provide a good balance between performance and concurrency. |
> | Keyboard | Blocking I/O | Keyboard input is typically infrequent and low-latency, so blocking I/O is often sufficient and simplifies the program's logic. |
> | Network Socket | Asynchronous I/O | Network I/O can have variable latencies and may involve waiting for remote responses, making asynchronous I/O a good choice for responsiveness. |
> | Serial Port | Non-blocking I/O | Serial communication often requires timely processing of incoming data, so non-blocking I/O allows the program to handle other tasks while monitoring the serial port. |
