> [!motivation] Optimizing Memory Usage
> In computer systems, it's crucial to **efficiently utilise memory resources**. However, programs often have portions of their address space that are not frequently accessed, leading to wasted memory pages. How can we optimize memory usage by focusing on the most demanded pages?

> [!idea] Demand Paging
> Demand paging is a memory management technique that **loads memory pages into physical memory only when they are needed**. It allows a process to run without requiring its entire address space to be loaded, **stashing away less-frequently used portions**. The operating system maintains the illusion that all pages are as fast as main memory.
>
> - **Lazy loading**: Pages are loaded into physical memory only when accessed.
> - **Page faults**: When a required page is not in physical memory, a page fault occurs, triggering the OS to load the page from secondary storage.
> - **Swapping**: Less-frequently used pages can be swapped out to make room for demanded pages.

> [!consider] Memory Storage Locations
> In demand paging, memory pages can be **stored in three locations:**
>
> - **RAM**: Pages currently in use reside in physical memory for fast access.
> - **Disk**: Less frequently used pages are swapped out to disk to free up memory.
> - **Not Allocated**: Pages that are not yet needed are not allocated in either RAM or disk.
>
> The location of each page is tracked using a **present bit** in the page table entry (PTE):
>
> - If the present bit is set (1), the page is in physical memory.
> - If the present bit is clear (0), the page is on disk or not allocated.
>

> [!idea] Dirty Bit
> When a page is modified in memory, it needs to be written back to disk to ensure data consistency. The **dirty bit in the PTE is used to track whether a page has been modified.**
>
> - When a page is loaded into memory, the dirty bit is initially clear (0).
> - If the **page is modified, the dirty bit is set (1) to indicate that it needs to be written back to disk before being swapped out.**
>
> The dirty bit helps optimize disk writes by only writing modified pages back to disk, reducing unnecessary I/O operations.

> [!example] Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy
> Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2, revolutionized open-world gaming by **eliminating loading screens entirely**. The game managed to create a seamless experience despite the PS2's limited memory of just 32 MB.
>
> **Memory Management Techniques:**
> - **Streaming**: The game constantly streamed game assets from the DVD into the PS2's memory as the player progressed through the world. This allowed for a continuous experience without interruptions.
> - **Dynamic Loading**: Only the necessary assets for the player's immediate surroundings were loaded into memory. As the player moved to new areas, the game dynamically loaded the required assets and unloaded the ones no longer needed.
> - **Asset Reuse**: The developers cleverly reused assets across different areas of the game world to minimize memory usage. Textures, models, and other resources were carefully designed to be modular and reusable.
> - **Efficient Data Structures**: The game utilized efficient data structures to store and access game assets quickly. This optimized memory usage and reduced the need for frequent disk access.

> [!idea] Address Translation Process
> Hardware and the operating system work together to **translate virtual addresses to physical addresses** using demand paging:
>
> 1. The CPU generates a virtual address and **checks the translation lookaside buffer for a matching entry**.
>    - If there is a hit, the translation is done quickly, and the physical address is obtained.
>    - If there is a miss, the CPU **performs a page table walk** to find the corresponding page table entry.
> 2. The CPU examines the **present bit** in the page table entry.
>    - If the present bit is set, the page is in physical memory. The CPU **extracts the physical frame number from the page table entry** and combines it with the offset to form the physical address.
>    - If the present bit is clear, a **page fault** occurs, and the CPU **traps into the operating system**.
> 3. On a page fault, the operating system handles the process of **bringing the requested page into memory**:
>    - The OS **selects a victim page** in memory to be replaced, typically using a page replacement algorithm.
>    - If the **dirty bit** of the victim page is set, indicating that it was modified, the OS **writes the page back to disk** before replacing it.
>    - The OS **reads the requested page from disk into memory**, using the disk address stored in the page table entry.
>    - The OS **updates the page table**, setting the present bit and updating the physical frame number in the page table entry.
> 4. The CPU resumes execution, re-accessing the memory location that caused the page fault, which now **resolves to the correct physical address**.
>
> By combining hardware support and operating system mechanisms, demand paging enables **efficient memory utilization** while providing a **seamless virtual memory abstraction** to processes.

|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Present/Absent bit      | Indicates whether the page is currently in physical memory (1) or not (0).           |
| Modified/Dirty bit      | Indicates whether the page has been modified (1) since it was brought into memory.  |
| Referenced bit          | Indicates whether the page has been accessed (1) recently.                           |
| Protection bits         | Specify the permissions for accessing the page (e.g., read, write, execute).         |
| Physical frame number   | The upper bits of the physical address where the page is located in physical memory. |
| Reserved bits           | Used by the operating system for various purposes.                                   |
| Page size               | Specifies the size of the page (e.g., 4KB, 2MB, 1GB).                                |
| Virtual page number     | The upper bits of the virtual address, used as an index into the page table.         |

> [!consider] Resuming Execution After a Page Fault (ELI5)
> Imagine you're reading a book, and suddenly you realize that the next page you need to read is missing. This is similar to what happens when a computer program tries to access a page of memory that's not currently available. We call this a "page fault."
>
> Now, when you discover the missing page, you don't want to start reading the book from the beginning, right? You want to find the missing page, put it back in the book, and continue reading from where you left off. This is what the computer tries to do when a page fault happens, but it's not always easy.
>
> The computer has to remember exactly where it was in the program when the page fault happened. It's like putting a bookmark in the book before you go to find the missing page. This can be tricky because some instructions in the computer program can be very complex, like a puzzle that needs to be solved step by step.
>
> When the missing page is found and brought back into memory, the computer needs to put everything back the way it was before the page fault happened. It's like returning to your book and making sure you start reading from the right place.
>
> Different types of computers (like CISC and RISC) have different ways of handling this situation. Some make it easier to resume from where you left off, while others might need to start the instruction from the beginning.
>
> The computer's hardware and operating system work together to make this process as smooth as possible, so you don't even notice that a page fault happened. It's like having a helpful librarian who quickly finds the missing page and places it back in your book, allowing you to continue reading without any interruptions.
