> In-place sorting algorithms **sort an array or list elements within the same memory space where the original data is stored,** without requiring additional space for storing the sorted output. This is achieved by modifying the input data itself, typically through swapping elements, to achieve a sorted order. The primary advantage of in-place sorting is its space efficiency, as it minimizes memory usage by not needing extra space proportional to the size of the input.
