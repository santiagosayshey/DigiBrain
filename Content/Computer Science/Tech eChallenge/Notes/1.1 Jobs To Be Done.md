> Companies often **struggle to understand why customers buy their products or services**. Traditional market segmentation focuses on demographic data, which doesn't explain the actual reasons behind purchase decisions.
> 
> Consider a milkshake company that collected demographic data but couldn't improve sales. The data showed who bought milkshakes, but not why people "hired" a milkshake instead of other options.
> 
> Traditional product development also focuses on products and features rather than the underlying needs customers are trying to fulfill. This often leads to:
> 
> - Product improvements that don't increase sales
> - Difficulty identifying true competitors (who may not sell similar products)
> - Marketing messages that don't resonate with customer needs

> [!idea] Jobs To Be Done
> 
> Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) is a framework that **views customer purchases as "hiring" products to complete specific "jobs" in their lives.**
> 
> Core principles:
> 
> - People don't buy products; they hire solutions to help them make progress in specific circumstances
> - Jobs have functional, emotional, and social dimensions
> - Products compete against everything that might solve the same job
> 
> Key components:
> 
> - Job definition: The progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance
> - Job circumstances: The situation that triggers the need
> - Success criteria: How customers measure a successful outcome
> - Constraints: Limitations that affect job completion
> 
> |Dimension|Description|Example|
> |---|---|---|
> |Functional|Practical task completion|Get from point A to B quickly|
> |Emotional|How customer wants to feel|Feel confident in presentation|
> |Social|How customer wants to be perceived|Appear environmentally conscious|

> [!example] Classic Examples
> 
> **The Milkshake Example**
> 
> McDonald's discovered customers were "hiring" morning milkshakes to:
> 
> - Provide an easy breakfast for long commutes
> - Keep them full until lunch
> - Give them something to do during boring drives
> 
> Competing products weren't other milkshakes but bananas, bagels, and breakfast bars.
> 
> **IKEA Bookcase**
> 
> The job isn't "I need a bookcase" but:
> 
> - "I need to display my books and possessions attractively"
> - "I need to organize my living space"
> - "I need to express my personal style affordably"
> 
> **Interflora Flowers**
> 
> The job isn't "I need flowers" but:
> 
> - "I need to show someone I care during a special occasion"
> - "I need to apologize effectively"
> - "I need to commemorate an important moment"
> 
> These jobs explain why flower delivery services compete with chocolates, greeting cards, and even phone calls.

> [!example] Real-World Applications
> 
> **Intuit TurboTax**
> 
> Job: "Help me file my taxes correctly without an accountant"
> 
> JTBD insights:
> 
> - Customers feared making mistakes
> - Emotional job: Reduce anxiety about tax compliance
> - Social job: Feel competent handling financial matters
> 
> Solution: Redesigned interface with confidence-building language and step-by-step guidance.
> 
> **Airbnb**
> 
> Job: "Help me experience a place like a local, not a tourist"
> 
> JTBD insights:
> 
> - Hotels met the functional job of providing accommodation
> - Failed emotional job of authentic local connection
> - Failed social job of having unique experiences worth sharing
> 
> Solution: Focusing marketing on unique homes and local experiences rather than just accommodation features.

> [!consider] Applying JTBD in Business
> 
> **Conducting JTBD Research**
> 
> Effective research techniques:
> 
> - Timeline interviews: Trace the entire journey from first thought to purchase
> - Forces of progress analysis: Examine push (problem) and pull (solution) factors alongside anxiety and habit
> - Switch interviews: Focus on customers who recently changed from one solution to another
> 
> **Common Pitfalls**
> 
> - Confusing customer wants with jobs
> - Defining jobs too broadly or narrowly
> - Focusing only on functional aspects while ignoring emotional and social dimensions
> 
> **Integration with Other Methods**
> 
> JTBD complements other frameworks:
> 
> - Personas + JTBD = More complete understanding of customer motivations
> - Customer journey maps + JTBD = Deeper insights into decision points
> - Design thinking + JTBD = More targeted innovation

> [!example] Implementing JTBD Framework
> 
> **Step 1: Job Identification**
> 
> Interview questions:
> 
> - "What were you trying to accomplish when you purchased our product?"
> - "What would you have done if our product wasn't available?"
> - "What solution did you use before ours, and why did you switch?"
> 
> **Step 2: Job Statement Creation**
> 
> Format: When [circumstance], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].
> 
> Examples:
> 
> - "When I'm running late in the morning, I want to grab a filling breakfast quickly, so I can avoid hunger during important meetings."
> - "When I'm redecorating my home on a budget, I want to find stylish furniture at affordable prices, so I can feel proud of my living space without financial stress."
> 
> **Step 3: Solution Development**
> 
> Netflix example:
> 
> - Job identified: "Help me relax and escape after a long day without leaving my home"
> - Solution elements:
>     - Personalized recommendations (reducing decision fatigue)
>     - Auto-play next episode (reducing friction)
>     - Original content (providing unique experiences)
>     - Multiple profiles (addressing social context)
