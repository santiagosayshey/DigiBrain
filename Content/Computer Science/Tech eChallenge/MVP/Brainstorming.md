# Research Paper to Video Summary System Outline

## Core Concept

A system that transforms research papers into concise, informative video summaries by breaking down text hierarchically, extracting key concepts, and mapping them to visual elements.

## Process Pipeline

1. **Document Analysis**
    - Parse the full text document
    - Identify structural components (abstract, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion)
    - Extract metadata (authors, publication date, field of study)
2. **Hierarchical Decomposition**
    
    - Split text into logical sections and paragraphs
    - Tag paragraphs by function (thesis statement, supporting evidence, methodology, results, conclusion)
    - Apply structural constraints (e.g., one thesis, one conclusion, multiple supporting points)
3. **Sentence-Level Processing**
    
    - Break paragraphs into individual sentences
    - Generate a concise "gist" for each sentence
    - Create image tags/prompts for visual representation
4. **Argument Mapping**
    
    - Identify relationships between concepts
    - Combine related points into higher-level arguments
    - Create a traversable knowledge tree representing the paper's structure
5. **Narrative Construction**
    
    - Determine optimal traversal path through the knowledge tree
    - Ensure logical flow of information
    - Balance completeness with conciseness
6. **Video Generation**
    
    - Convert gists to script segments
    - Match image tags with appropriate visuals
    - Sequence content for maximum clarity and engagement
7. **Review & Refinement**
    
    - Verify factual accuracy against source material
    - Ensure coherence of narrative
    - Optimize for viewer engagement and comprehension

## Technical Approach

- Text processing using NLP techniques
- Argument tree construction and traversal
- Visual-textual alignment for effective knowledge transfer
- Constraint-based content selection to maintain appropriate length and detail

This system works by systematically deconstructing complex research content and rebuilding it into a structured, accessible video format that preserves core information while enhancing engagement.
