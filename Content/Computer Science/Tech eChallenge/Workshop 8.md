help me with this workshop? dont add any more risks, just expand and add actual experiements to the ones ive given in the context of the ... context.

  

List 3-5 Risks

- What are we unsure abou
- What's one experiment we can run this week?

  
| Concern | Experiment |
| ------- | ---------- |
|         |            |

Risks

- cost / business model.
	- we have already discussed potentially business models (b2b and b2c not sure if these are the correct terms). Either we sell to businesses (universities, journals, research platforms, google scholar, etc) OR we sell to individual customers.
	- is what we're doing going to be viable in b2c? are researchers / post grads going to shell out the amount of money on an individual subscription for this? or are we going to have more luck with businesses?
	- 

- copyright. how are going to deal with copyright issues here? does any of what we do fall under fair use? do we need to implement DRM for generated videos if we allow anyone to generate them?

- team lacks business expertise / we have no business model - still deciding on how we want to sell our product - directly to end users (post grads, researchers, etc) or as a service to publications / hosters. what is more important to US and what is more financially viable - need to compromise on this front

- cost - can we actually make money from this - initial prototyping shows that generating videos is quite expensive and resource intensive - is there a path forward to getting this number down and making a profit? we need to test this and come up with a business plan that 1. works linearly with the cost and 2. can be scaled inversely

## About Us

  

[](https://github.com/SynapsisAI#about-us)

  

Synapsis AI is a collaborative project focused on transforming complex text into concise visual summaries through systematic decomposition and reconstruction of core meanings. Our technology decomposes text into fundamental components before synthesizing these elements into structured, visually-enhanced summaries that preserve essential information while significantly reducing complexity.

## Our Approach

  

[](https://github.com/SynapsisAI#our-approach)

  

We follow a first-principles approach to text understanding:

  

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking down documents into paragraphs, sentences, and core meanings

2. **Synthesis**: Reconstructing essential elements into coherent, structured arguments

3. **Visualization**: Enhancing understanding through complementary visual representations
