| **1. Cost / Business Model Viability** | - **B2C Willingness to Pay:** Will individual researchers (PhD students, postdocs, academics) pay a subscription fee that adequately covers our current $3-5 cost per video and provides a margin? What price point would they find acceptable for regular use? <br> - **B2B Potential Value:** Do universities, research platforms, or journals see enough value to justify paying for institutional access? What specific problems can this solve for *them* (e.g., improving research accessibility, promoting publications)? <br> - **Cost Reduction:** What are the main factors driving the $3-5 video generation cost? Can we identify opportunities for optimisation? | **Experiment 1a (Price Gauge):** Create a simple mock-up of a subscription page. Offer 2-3 hypothetical pricing tiers (e.g., Basic: 3 videos/month for $X, Pro: 10 videos/month for $Y, Premium: Unlimited for $Z). Approach 10-15 target researchers. Briefly explain the service and show an example video. Ask them which tier, if any, they would consider and why. *Goal: Gauge initial price sensitivity and identify preferred features.* <br><br> **Experiment 1b (B2B Problem/Solution Fit Interviews):** Identify 3-5 contacts in target B2B sectors (e.g., a university librarian, a journal editor, someone at a research funding body). Request a 20-30 minute informational interview. Focus on their current challenges in disseminating complex research and making it understandable. (Perhaps arrange an interview with Alex?) Then, briefly introduce Synapsis AI's concept and get their reaction. *Goal: Understand B2B pain points and their initial reaction to our solution, not to sell at this stage.* <br><br> **Experiment 1c (Cost Analysis):** Break down the $3-5 video generation cost. *Goal: Identify the most expensive component in the current pipeline to target for future optimization discussions.* |
| **2. Growth / Customer Acquisition**   | - **Initial Traction:** Beyond personal networks, which channels are most effective for reaching early adopters in the academic and research community? <br> - **Freemium Effectiveness:** Will offering a limited free trial (e.g., one free video) effectively convert users to paid subscriptions? What constitutes an appealing freemium offer?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Experiment 2a (Targeted Content Teaser):** Select a highly relevant online academic community (e.g., a specific subreddit like r/PhD, r/labrats). Create one high-quality example visual summary from a recent, relevant open-access paper. Post it with a brief explanation of how it was made (mentioning Synapsis AI) and a link to our landing page where they can express interest or request a demo/free sample. *Goal: Test channel effectiveness and generate initial interest.* <br><br> **Experiment 2b (Freemium Model Test):** Offer to manually create one free visual summary for users. Use this to gather detailed feedback on the output and its perceived value, and ask if they would pay for more. *Goal: Test the appeal of a free video and gather qualitative feedback on product value and willingness to pay.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **3. Copyright**                       | - **Fair Use:** When summarizing and visualizing published research, what aspects of our process fall under fair use, and what might require permissions? <br> - **User Responsibility vs. Platform Responsibility:** Who is responsible if a user uploads copyrighted material they don't have rights to summarize? How do other content generation tools handle this? <br> - **Output Ownership:** Who owns the copyright of the generated visual summary â€“ the user, the original author, or Synapsis?                                                                                                                                                                     | **Experiment 3a (Competitor Copyright Policy Review):** Identify 3-5 other tools that transform or summarize existing content (e.g., text-to-video, AI summarizers, presentation generators). Carefully review their Terms of Service and Copyright Policies. Note how they address input material rights and output ownership. *Goal: Understand industry standards and common approaches.* <br><br> **Experiment 3b (Document Transformation Process):** Create a detailed internal document outlining exactly how Synapsis AI processes source text. Specify what elements are extracted, how they are transformed, and what new creative input the system (or user via prompts) adds. _Goal: Prepare necessary documentation for seeking legal advice._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **4. Product Communication**           | - **Clarity of Value:** How can we quickly and clearly communicate Synapsis AI's value proposition to a non-technical academic audience without them getting lost in jargon like "decomposition, synthesis, visualization"? <br> - **Demo Effectiveness:** Is a live demo too risky or confusing? What's the most impactful way to showcase the product's capabilities?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Experiment 4a (Pre-recorded Demo & Feedback):** Create a concise (60-90 second) pre-recorded demo video. Start with a problem (e.g., "Struggling to keep up with dense research papers?"), show the input (a complex text snippet), briefly illustrate the Synapsis AI process conceptually (not overly technical), and showcase the engaging visual summary output. Show this video to 5-7 people from the target audience (researchers, students) and 2-3 people outside the immediate field. Get their feedback: What was clear? What was confusing? What was most exciting? Did they understand the benefit? *Goal: Test the clarity and impact of a pre-recorded demo and refine messaging.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
