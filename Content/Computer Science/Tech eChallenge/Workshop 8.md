Risks
- copyright. how are going to deal with copyright issues here? does any of what we do fall under fair use? do we need to implement DRM for generated videos if we allow anyone to generate them?
- team lacks business expertise / we have no business model - still deciding on how we want to sell our product - directly to end users (post grads, researchers, etc) or as a service to publications / hosters. what is more important to US and what is more financially viable - need to compromise on this front
- cost - can we actually make money from this - initial prototyping shows that generating videos is quite expensive and resource intensive - is there a path forward to getting this number down and making a profit? we need to test this and come up with a business plan that 1. works linearly with the cost and 2. can be scaled inversely

## About Us

[](https://github.com/SynapsisAI#about-us)

Synapsis AI is a collaborative project focused on transforming complex text into concise visual summaries through systematic decomposition and reconstruction of core meanings. Our technology decomposes text into fundamental components before synthesizing these elements into structured, visually-enhanced summaries that preserve essential information while significantly reducing complexity.

## Our Team

## Our Approach

[](https://github.com/SynapsisAI#our-approach)

We follow a first-principles approach to text understanding:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking down documents into paragraphs, sentences, and core meanings
2. **Synthesis**: Reconstructing essential elements into coherent, structured arguments
3. **Visualization**: Enhancing understanding through complementary visual representations

For visualization, create low-fidelity mockups or storyboards representing the intended visual output. <br> 3. **Research "fair use" guidelines** (specifically for your relevant jurisdiction - e.g., US, EU) in the context of summarization, transformation, and visual representation of existing works. <br> 4. **Analyze each of your 3-5 generated examples against these fair use criteria.** Document how much of the original is used, the nature of the transformation, the purpose (e.g., educational, commercial), and the potential market impact on the original work. <br> 5. **Draft a preliminary internal copyright policy** outlining best practices for text selection and transformation based on this analysis. Identify clear "red flag" scenarios.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Team lacks business expertise / We have no business model** | - Who is our primary target customer (post-grads, researchers, publications, educational institutions, businesses)? <br> - What specific pain points does Synapsis AI solve for them that they would be willing to pay for? <br> - What is the perceived value of "visual clarity" for different user segments? <br> - Which business model (direct-to-consumer subscription, B2B licensing, per-video fee, freemium) aligns best with our value proposition and the team's long-term vision? <br> - What are the key drivers for each potential customer segment (e.g., time-saving for researchers, increased engagement for publications)?                                                                | **Experiment: Customer Discovery Interviews & Value Proposition Testing.** <br> 1. **Identify 2 distinct potential customer segments** (e.g., 5 postgraduate students and 3 representatives from academic publications or university libraries). <br> 2. **Develop a short interview script** (5-7 questions) focused on understanding their current methods for dealing with complex texts, their challenges, and their reaction to Synapsis AI's core concept (complex text to visual clarity). **Do not try to sell them the product yet.** Focus on their problems and needs. <br> 3. **Conduct these 8 interviews.** Record key pain points, existing solutions they use, and their initial, unaided reaction to your value proposition. <br> 4. **Synthesize the interview findings.** Identify common themes, specific language used by potential customers to describe their problems, and any strong signals towards one customer segment or business model over another. <br> 5. **Draft two distinct value propositions**, one tailored for each tested segment, based on the feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cost**                                                      | - What are the specific components contributing to the high cost of video generation (e.g., GPU processing, specific algorithms, software licenses, storage)? <br> - Can we significantly reduce generation costs through algorithmic optimization, alternative technologies, or infrastructure choices without sacrificing core quality? <br> - What is the minimum viable quality for a generated video that still provides significant value to a user? <br> - How does the cost of generation scale with the length and complexity of the input text and the desired sophistication of the visual summary? <br> - What pricing models would be sustainable given current and projected generation costs? | **Experiment: Cost Component Analysis & MVP Definition.** <br> 1. **Detailed Cost Breakdown:** For a sample complex text, meticulously track and list every step and resource involved in generating a visual summary (even if parts are manual now, estimate the automated cost). Assign a time or resource cost to each (e.g., X hours of processing on Y type of GPU, Z minutes of manual storyboarding). <br> 2. **Identify the top 3 most expensive components** in the generation process. <br> 3. **Brainstorm 2-3 potential cost-reduction strategies for each of these top components** (e.g., for GPU cost: investigate more efficient algorithms, explore different cloud providers, consider off-peak processing. For a specific software license: explore open-source alternatives or simpler tools for an MVP). <br> 4. **Define a "Minimum Viable Product (MVP)" version of a visual summary.** What is the absolute simplest visual output that still demonstrates the core value of "complex text to visual clarity"? This might mean shorter videos, simpler animations, or even static infographics initially. <br> 5. **Estimate the cost to produce this MVP visual summary** and compare it to the cost of your "ideal" visual summary. This helps quantify the potential savings of a leaner approach. |
