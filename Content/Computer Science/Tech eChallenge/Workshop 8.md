Risks
- copyright. how are going to deal with copyright issues here? does any of what we do fall under fair use? do we need to implement DRM for generated videos if we allow anyone to generate them?
- team lacks business expertise / we have no business model - still deciding on how we want to sell our product - directly to end users (post grads, researchers, etc) or as a service to publications / hosters. what is more important to US and what is more financially viable - need to compromis

## About Us

[](https://github.com/SynapsisAI#about-us)

Synapsis AI is a collaborative project focused on transforming complex text into concise visual summaries through systematic decomposition and reconstruction of core meanings. Our technology decomposes text into fundamental components before synthesizing these elements into structured, visually-enhanced summaries that preserve essential information while significantly reducing complexity.

## Our Approach

[](https://github.com/SynapsisAI#our-approach)

We follow a first-principles approach to text understanding:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking down documents into paragraphs, sentences, and core meanings
2. **Synthesis**: Reconstructing essential elements into coherent, structured arguments
3. **Visualization**: Enhancing understanding through complementary visual representations
