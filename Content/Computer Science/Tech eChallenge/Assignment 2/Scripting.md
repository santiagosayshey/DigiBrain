| 0:15 - 1:00        | **Rapid Montage / Visual Sequence:** <br> - **Screen:** Bob scrolling *fast* down dense SvelteKit docs page. <br> - **Screen:** Zooms into 'Routing' section (`+page.svelte`, `+layout.svelte`, diagram). <br> - **Cut:** Bob looking confused, squinting.<br> - **Screen:** Scrolls to 'Loading Data' (`load` functions, `+page.server.js`). <br> - **Screen:** Jumps to 'Reactivity' (`$: ` syntax). <br> - **Cut:** Bob tries typing in mock editor, gets error. <br> - **Screen:** Jumps to 'Lifecycle' (`onMount`, `onDestroy`).<br> - **Cut:** Bob has multiple Stack Overflow tabs open, frantic.<br> - **Overlay:** Clock speeds up / Calendar flashes "DEADLINE TOMORROW!".<br> - **Sound:** Ticking, clicks, sighs, short sharp sounds.     | **Bob:** (Dialogue and V.O. interwoven with visuals)<br> (V.O. over scrolling) "Wrong! So, so wrong. Okay, 'Getting Started'... how hard can it be?"<br> (V.O. over routing zoom) "...except it's file-based? With plus signs? Okay..."<br> (To camera, stressed, over loading data) "And `load` functions... server, client... both? Need to keep track."<br> (V.O. over reactivity zoom) "Then reactivity... dollar sign colon means... magic?"<br> (Muttering, over editor error) "Or... not magic. Syntax error."<br> (V.O. over lifecycle/SO) "And the lifecycle! Gotta manage state..." <br> (To camera, runs hand through hair, over clock/calendar) "It's like trying to untangle headphones in the dark!" | Problem / Pain Point (Visual Emphasis & Specific Examples)    |
| 1:00 - 1:25        | Bob stops frantic action. Leans into camera, looks overwhelmed but trying to articulate. Takes a breath. Gestures emphatically at screen/docs off-camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Bob:** "Look, the information is *all here*, but it's just... a **wall of text and code snippets.** My brain is hitting overload trying to connect the dots between reactivity, routing, server loads, and lifecycle stuff. I can't *see* the big picture clearly! <br><br> I desperately need a way to **cut through the noise**, to **grasp the essential structure** and **key concepts** *without* spending hours deciphering every single paragraph. I need to **build a mental model** that actually makes sense, quickly! So I can **feel confident** enough to actually *use* this framework and, you know, **walk into that team meeting tomorrow and explain it coherently**, not just... blanking out or sounding like I crammed five minutes before. There *has* to be a faster way to get this knowledge *into my head* effectively!" | Problem / Pain Point & Need (Verbalization - Natural JTBD) |
| 1:25 - 1:40        | Bob slumps back. Suddenly, his eyes widen. A stylised, slightly cheesy "Pop-up Ad" graphic appears picture-in-picture (or zoom to screen). Ad shows "Synapsis" logo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Bob:** "...wait.

| 1:40 - 2:25        | **MVP Demo:** Screen recording takes over most of the frame. Bob's face visible picture-in-picture, looking amazed. <br> - Show: Uploading a PDF/doc (maybe a section of SvelteKit docs). <br> - Show: A "Processing" animation (can be faked/sped up). <br> - Show: Snippets of the generated video: simple visuals, clear voiceover summarizing key points (maybe showing routing, reactivity, lifecycle).                                                     | **Bob:** (Voiceover, excited) "Whoa! Okay, let's try this... I upload the SvelteKit 'Getting Started' PDF... it analyses the text... uses AI to summarise the core ideas, picks out visuals... generates a voiceover... and... BOOM! A video summary! Look! It's explaining the routing... reactive statements... lifecycle... This is *exactly* what I needed!"                                                                                                                                        | Solution & MVP Demo                                           |
