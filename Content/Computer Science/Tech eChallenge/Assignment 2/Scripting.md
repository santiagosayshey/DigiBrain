I need to **build a mental model** that actually makes sense, quickly! So I can **feel confident** enough to actually *use* this framework and, you know, **walk into that team meeting tomorrow and explain it coherently**, not just... blanking out or sounding like I crammed five minutes before.

| 1:25 - 1:40        | Bob slumps back. Suddenly, his eyes widen. A stylised, slightly cheesy "Pop-up Ad" graphic appears picture-in-picture (or zoom to screen).
