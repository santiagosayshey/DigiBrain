I need to build that mental model _fast_.<br><br>Because honestly? Just _thinking_ about that meeting tomorrow makes my stomach churn. _(Slight wince)_ That pure **stress**... I just want to **feel confident** walking in there, actually knowing the material deep down, not just winging it again. I need to be able to **contribute properly** this time, show Sarah I'm actually on top of things â€“ maybe finally have a shot at that **promotion**? â€“ instead of just trying to avoid 'the look'.

Project managers demonstrated their struggle to extract technical requirements from sprawling documentation. **[Meets Needs?]** This consistent feedback confirmed the core need. Our concept tests revealed professionals across sectors immediately grasped the value - because they're all drowning in the same information overflow. **[Future Plans]** In future, we plan to expand validation through structured user testing with legal professionals navigating case law, medical staff processing clinical guidelines, and educators synthesizing curriculum materials.
