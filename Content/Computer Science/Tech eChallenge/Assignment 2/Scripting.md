| 0:00 - 0:15            | - Intro Card: Simple text: "Bob's Brain Dumps - Ep 1: SvelteKit?!"<br>- Cut to: Medium shot (torso up) of "Bob" looking slightly frazzled, webcam-style. Energetic but tired.                                                                                                                                                          | **Bob:** (Waves awkwardly) "Hey... uh, internet? Bob here. Software intern. So, my boss wants me to learn SvelteKit... like, _yesterday_. And then present it. Easy, right?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Intro                |
| 0:15 - 0:45            | Quick cuts: Bob scrolling _fast_ through dense SvelteKit docs website. Close up on his stressed face. A digital clock overlay ticking rapidly. Shot of huge pile of printouts.                                                                                                                                                         | **Bob:** "Wrong! This documentation... it's HUGE. I'm drowning here. I need to figure out the core concepts, how it works, its pros and cons... basically, I need to _understand_ it fast enough to actually _use_ it and then explain it simply to the team."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Problem / Pain Point |
| 0:45 - 1:15            | Bob leans into the camera, looking exasperated. Maybe holds head in hands briefly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Bob:** "(Sighs Dramatically) **[JTBD Winky Moment]** Seriously, my job right now is: **When** I'm faced with complex technical docs under pressure, **I want to** rapidly extract the key information and structure, **so I can** determine relevance, apply it, _and_ avoid looking like a total newbie in front of the seniors! Functionally, I need speed. Emotionally, I need less panic! Socially, I need... competence!"                                                                                                | Problem / JTBD       |
| 1:15 - 1:30            | Bob slumps back. Suddenly, his eyes widen. A stylised, slightly cheesy "Pop-up Ad" graphic appears picture-in-picture (or zoom to screen). Ad shows "Synapsis" logo.                                                                                                                                                                   | **Bob:** "If only there was a... wait. What's this? (Reads fake ad text aloud) 'Tired of Text Walls? Need to grasp complex info FAST & share it? Synapsis: AI-powered Video Summaries from any Document!'"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Transition           |
| 1:30 - 2:15            | **MVP Demo:** Screen recording takes over most of the frame. Bob's face visible picture-in-picture, looking amazed. Show: Uploading a PDF/doc (maybe a section of SvelteKit docs). A "Processing" animation (can be faked/sped up). Then show snippets of the generated video: simple visuals, clear voiceover summarizing key points. | **Bob:** (Voiceover, excited) "Whoa! Okay, let's try this... I upload the SvelteKit 'Getting Started' PDF... it analyses the text... uses AI to summarise the core ideas, picks out visuals... generates a voiceover... and... BOOM! A video summary! Look! It's explaining the basic structure... component lifecycle... key APIs... this is _exactly_ what I needed!"                                                                                                                                                         | Solution & MVP Demo  |
| 2:15 - 2:45            | Bob now looks relieved, maybe slightly smug. He quickly puts on a pair of reading glasses (or a tweed jacket patch appears). Camera angle slightly different. Slightly more serious tone.                                                                                                                                              | **'Researcher Bob':** "And it's not just for frantic interns! Imagine being a researcher wading through dozens of papers. **[Target Market 1]** Synapsis helps quickly assess relevance and grasp core arguments. Huge time saver. **[Characteristics]** We're time-poor, need synthesis, deal with complexity..."                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Target Market        |
| 2:45 - 3:00            | Bob/Researcher takes off glasses, looks directly at camera. Background might subtly change (or just posture becomes more 'presenter' like). The vlog 'persona' drops.                                                                                                                                                                  | **'The Developer' (You):** "Okay, dropping the character for a sec.

Maybe gesture towards where the 'Bob' character was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **'The Developer':** "So, how did we **validate** this? **[Activities]** Firstly, through personal experience – like Bob, we _felt_ this pain as students dealing with dense material. We've had informal chats with university researchers confirming the literature review burden. Peer discussions highlighted the communication challenge. **[Meets Needs?]** Early feedback on the _concept_ is strong – people instantly see the value in saving time and improving comprehension and communication. The JTBDs resonate." | Market Validation    |
| 3:45 - 4:15            | Maintain direct address. Maybe subtly gesture to indicate 'team'. Reference the video itself if applicable (e.g. "like the editing here...")                                                                                                                                                                                           | **'The Developer':** "Our **current team** brings strong **[Skills]** software engineering skills – we built the core MVP functionality you saw.
