| 1 - Problem           | What problem are you addressing                               | - Reading long, complicated texts is incredibly inefficient. Often we want to understand the main points of something before we commit to reading the entire thing; a blurb if you will. This is especially evident in research articles. Researchers, authors, etc often read through hundreds of research articles as part of their research and this often involves long, boring reading first. It would be more engaging / less boring if we could 1. Reduce the time spent in this stage, 2. Map text to a more engaging medium - audio / video. |
