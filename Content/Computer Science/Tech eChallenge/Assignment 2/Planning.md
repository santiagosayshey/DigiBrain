| 1 - Problem | What problem are you addressing                               | - Reading long, complicated texts is incredibly inefficient. Often we want to understand the main points of something before we commit to reading the entire thing; a blurb if you will. This is especially evident in research articles. Researchers, authors, etc often read through hundreds of research articles as part of their research and this often involves long, boring reading first. It would be more engaging / less boring if we could 1. Reduce the time spent in this stage, 2. Map text to a more engaging medium - audio / video.<br>- This becomes even more evident when we have to present our findings to other people. I have all this huge array of new knowledge that I've spent days learning, how can I communicate this information effectively and in a shorter timeframe than it took for me to learn it?  |

video ideas
- playing a role. instead of presenting a pitch of a problem / solution, show a problem / solution in real time. 
- start the 'pitch' and introduce myself as a character - Bob - a software engineering intern who's been tasked to learn a new javascript framework and present my findings to the team. Present the video as a 'vlog' for my youtube channel. 
- Start on the sveltekit docs, show myself frantically researching / reading / summarising and ultimately struggling. 
- Key emphasis here on editing to show just how overhwheliming the docs are / how little time i have until the task deadline.
- I also need to get in some clear text of me speaking about the exact jobs i need to complete - maybe this can be a funny winky moment where im explicitly showing to the viewer / marker - yes im fufilling the marking criteria. something like - wow i really wish (explain super long customer job with functional, social, emotional goals), if only.....
- Then have some miracle popup show that even funnier answers this exact problem in excruciating detail - like "ever wish you could (solve super long customer job with features that solve your exact functional, social and emotional goals?)"
- Then you link to the website, show the MVP in action, etc
- For target market, we can effectively do some fancy editing and change outfits / click fingers to show hey this works if im a software engineering intent, a post grad student, a depressed faculty researcher and then cheekily cut to an undergrad cheating in an assignment then cut away really quickly. question is how do we diffentiate different peoples here? we can be super on the nose and have name tags, change the browser tab, clothes, etc. 
- Then we can transition to an actual pitch where the last person we switch to is the real us (the devs), so we can effectively answer the last two bits. market validation would just be us speaking to the characters we switched to before and asking ourselves question funnily, but also linking to actual research we've done (speaking to profs at the uni, asking them if this is a tool they could benefit from. using our own expereince as undergrads and our own pain points. etc) 
- Then for team skills stay on the dev persona and well show them that the entire presentation was coded from scratch by us and for this presentation. Obviously expand a lot here and expicitly state what technical skils we have in terms of coding. 
- Then we need to present what gaps we need to consider. Honestly really not sure yet lol.
