Great, I’ll conduct a deep research into coffee products using the Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) framework. I’ll explore:

- The specific jobs coffee products are designed for
- Customer characteristics tied to each job
- How design features map to these jobs

Then, I’ll apply the JTBD framework to coffee as a real-world example, using the JTBD Story Canvas:

- Situation: When...
- Motivation: I want to...
- Outcome: So I can...

And I’ll cover functional, emotional, and social goals, along with key features, market positioning, and product limitations. I’ll let you know when it’s ready for review.

# Jobs-to-Be-Done Analysis of Coffee Products

## Part 1: General JTBD Analysis of Coffee Products

### Main “Jobs” Coffee Products Fulfill

Coffee is more than a beverage – people “hire” coffee to accomplish various jobs in their lives. Some of the primary jobs that coffee products are created to fulfill include:

- **Provide Energy and Alertness:** The most fundamental functional job of coffee is to help users wake up and stay alert. Many consumers drink coffee as a morning **fuel to kickstart their day**, using caffeine to overcome grogginess and improve focus ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=,blood%20pressure%20or%20stimulate%20alertness)). For example, a strong cup in the morning or during a midday slump is _“hired”_ to increase alertness and productivity so one can perform tasks effectively.
    
- **Offer Comfort and Enjoyment:** Beyond caffeine, coffee often serves an emotional job of providing comfort, warmth, and sensory pleasure. The routine of a morning coffee can be a comforting ritual that gives a sense of stability and “me time” ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=,blood%20pressure%20or%20stimulate%20alertness)). Consumers derive **satisfaction and pleasure** from the rich taste and aroma ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=main%20emotions%20and%20consumers%E2%80%99%20habits,positive%20emotions%20from%20coffee%20consumption)), whether it’s a simple home brew or a decadent flavored latte. The act of sipping a warm cup can relieve stress and create a cozy, indulgent moment in an otherwise hectic day.
    
- **Enable Social Connection and Ritual:** Coffee plays a significant social role. Meeting a friend or colleague “for coffee” is a low-pressure way to socialize or network. Coffee shops serve as communal spaces (the _“third place”_ concept) where people feel a sense of belonging and community ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20Starbucks%E2%80%99%20version%20of,date%20on%20a%20weekend%20afternoon)). In many cultures, coffee drinking is a shared ritual or a part of special occasions (e.g. an espresso after dinner) ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=,blood%20pressure%20or%20stimulate%20alertness)). Thus, people hire coffee to facilitate conversation, connection, and participation in cultural rituals.
    
- **Express Identity or Lifestyle:** Some consumers use coffee choices to express themselves. Ordering a particular drink or brand can signal sophistication or personal taste. For instance, a consumer might choose a single-origin pour-over to emphasize their connoisseurship, or carry a recognizable coffee chain cup as a lifestyle accessory. Especially for younger generations, coffee has become an **expression of personality and creativity**, with customized or “Instagrammable” drinks reflecting one’s identity ([David Teicher on X: "Gen Z's influence is turning coffee into an ...](https://twitter.com/Aerocles/status/1903475138227556804#:~:text=David%20Teicher%20on%20X%3A%20,the%20way%20America%20drinks%20coffee)).
    

In short, coffee products fulfill _functional jobs_ (caffeine boost, thirst-quenching, warmth), _emotional jobs_ (comfort, enjoyment, habit), and _social jobs_ (connection, status, cultural belonging). Different customers prioritize different jobs, which drives the variety of coffee products in the market.

### Types of Coffee Customers and Their Needs

Because people hire coffee for diverse reasons, we can identify distinct customer types, each with key characteristics and “jobs” they expect coffee to do for them:

- **The Social Sharer (Young Enthusiast):** Often younger consumers, they treat coffee as a social experience or a social media moment. For them, the job might be _“When I go to a café, I want a drink and setting that’s photo-worthy, so I can share with friends and feel trendy.”_ These customers value visually appealing drinks and cafe ambiance. For example, _“young girls…buy a cup of coffee, and the first thing they do is take nice photos and share with their friends.”_ The coffee (and shop) is hired to provide a _“cool…background for their photos.”_ ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Type%20one%3A%20Young%20girls,products%2C%20and%20very%20good%20lighting)) Here the coffee fulfills an emotional/social job of fun and status (the actual taste or caffeine may be secondary). Competitors for this job might even be non-coffee venues like smoothie shops or any place with a cute aesthetic ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Type%20one%3A%20Young%20girls,products%2C%20and%20very%20good%20lighting)).
    
- **The Busy Professional:** This customer (e.g. a business person or commuting worker) is often “hiring” coffee for functional utility. They need coffee to **provide energy quickly and fit into a packed schedule**. For instance, a corporate employee might grab a quick coffee before work or use a coffee shop as a meeting spot. Their job statement could be: _“When I have back-to-back meetings, I want a fast, convenient caffeine fix, so I can stay alert through the day.”_ If they visit a café, they may also expect a productive environment: _“Business men…will be looking to see if your coffee shop can provide a meeting space – quiet environment, good Wi-Fi, comfortable seating, outlets – otherwise the coffee won’t do the job they want.”_ ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Type%20two%3A%20Business%20men,can%20do%20the%20job%20better)) In this case, the coffee (and cafe) is hired both for the drink and as a functional workspace. If the product or venue can’t meet these needs, they’ll choose an alternative (another café, office coffee, etc.).
    
- **The Stressed Parent (Relaxation Seeker):** This segment, such as busy mothers or fathers, often wants coffee to create a small oasis of _relief or routine_ in a chaotic day. _“When I finally have a moment free, I want to enjoy a calm coffee break, so I can recharge.”_ A mother with kids might pick a café that offers a play area, essentially hiring the coffee shop as a place to relax while the kids are occupied. _“Busy mothers…want to find a place they can relax. If there is a children’s play area in your coffee shop…your coffee shop might be the ideal place a mother wants to hire.”_ ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Type%20three%3A%20Busy%20mothers%20with,this%20type%20of%20coffee%20shop)) In product terms, this customer might favor coffee that’s easy to make (to steal a quiet moment at home) or a comforting flavor that provides a bit of indulgence and stress relief.
    
- **The Coffee Purist (Connoisseur):** This customer cares deeply about the coffee _itself_. They “hire” coffee for the _quality of the beverage_ – rich flavor, craftsmanship, and perhaps the ritual of brewing. As one example, travelers or _“foreigners…just want a good cup of coffee. They don’t care about the remodel or background…they may not even want a table and chair.”_ ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Type%20four%3A%20Foreigners,or%20at%20the%20office%2C%20etc)) For purists, the job is _“When I drink coffee, I want the best taste and quality, so I can truly enjoy the experience.”_ They are often willing to invest time or money in specialty beans, elaborate brewing methods, or seek out artisan cafes. Emotional enjoyment (sensory pleasure, pride in one’s brewing skill) is key for them, and they may eschew convenience products that sacrifice quality.
    
- **The Student or Focused Worker:** This segment (students pulling late-night study sessions, writers, coders, etc.) hires coffee to **help maintain focus and productivity over long periods**. _“When I need to study or work for hours, I want coffee to keep me awake and alert, so I can concentrate and get things done.”_ Often their coffee is accompanied by a need for a conducive environment (quiet, desk space). In a cafe context, _“Students need a quiet environment…as well as caffeine to help them stay awake and focus.”_ ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Image)) They might also use convenient coffee (like instant packets or vending machine coffee) when working at odd hours. The functional job (staying awake) is primary, though there’s an emotional aspect in the ritual of a “study coffee” that signals getting into a productive mindset.
    

These archetypes illustrate how different customers prioritize different jobs-to-be-done: social expression, quick energy, relaxation, quality taste, or concentration. Real individuals may span multiple categories, but understanding these distinct needs helps in mapping coffee product features to the jobs they fulfill.

### Mapping Product Types to Jobs and Design Features

Coffee product designers tailor features to serve these specific jobs and customer needs. The table below maps various coffee product types to the key JTBD goals they fulfill and the design features that enable those jobs:

|**Coffee Product Type**|**Key JTBD Goals Fulfilled** (Functional / Emotional / Social)|**Design Features Serving These Jobs**|
|---|---|---|
|**Instant Coffee** (soluble powder)|**Functional:** Deliver caffeine _anywhere, instantly_ for quick energy on-the-go. **Emotional:** Provide a _simple comfort_ (a warm cup) even in settings with no equipment (e.g. travel, office). **Social:** Low – aimed more at individual convenience than status, though it allows participation in coffee drinking anywhere.|_Soluble coffee powder_ that dissolves in hot water within seconds ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20the%20coffee%20pod,and%20sugar%20if%20you%20require)). No brew gear needed (just add water), **zero skill** required ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=Requires%20No%20Skill%20to%20Operate)). Packaged in single-serve sachets or jars – _portable, long shelf-life_. Generally uses cheaper robusta beans, trading flavor complexity for consistency and cost savings ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=Mostly%20Made%20From%20Robusta)) ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=This%20is%20largely%20due%20to,beans%20in%20favour%20of%20volume)). These features make instant coffee **ultra-convenient and affordable**, ideal for busy people or those without coffee makers ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=Regardless%20of%20the%20coffee%20pod,and%20sugar%20if%20you%20require)) ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=When%20comparing%20the%20price%20of,buy%20individually%20and%20in%20pieces)).|
|**Drip Brew Coffee (Ground coffee for home)** – _e.g. Folgers_|**Functional:** Provide a _reliable daily dose of caffeine_ as part of a morning routine. **Emotional:** Offer _familiar taste and routine comfort_ at low cost (the “best part of waking up” feeling). **Social:** Family or office ritual (brewing a pot to share), but generally modest social signaling (a commonplace habit).|**Pre-ground coffee beans** in bulk packaging – convenient for drip machines. Standardized blends (e.g. Folgers Classic Roast) prioritized for consistency over exotic flavor. **Automatic drip brewers with timers** often used to have hot coffee ready in the morning, aligning with routine. Branding emphasizes home and family: Folgers’ iconic jingle “The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup” highlights its role in the morning job (['The Best Part of Wakin' Up': Folgers' Iconic Jingle Sells for $90,500](https://people.com/food/royalties-for-folgers-iconic-the-best-part-of-wakin-up-jingle-sells-for-90k/#:~:text=,is%20Folgers%20in%20your%20cup)). Design focuses on ease (just load machine) and familiarity.|
|**Single-Serve Coffee Pods** – _e.g. Nespresso, Keurig_|**Functional:** _Convenient, one-touch brewing_ of a consistent, café-like coffee at home or office. Delivers caffeine with minimal effort or mess. **Emotional:** A bit of _luxury and indulgence_ – promise of a high-quality brew and variety of flavors without barista skill. Reduces the “hassle” in the morning, lowering stress ([Jobs to be Done Framework|by Juhi Garg|
|**Ready-to-Drink (RTD) Coffee** (bottled/canned)|**Functional:** _Portable caffeine boost_ anytime – no brewing needed. Great for _on-the-go consumption_ (commuters, road trips, etc.). Often served cold for quick refreshment. **Emotional:** Many RTDs are formulated as indulgent treats (e.g. sweet iced coffees, cold brew lattes), providing _enjoyment and refreshment_. Also helps satisfy cravings for specialty coffee when a café visit isn’t possible. **Social:** Minor social aspect – grabbing a trendy bottled cold brew can be _seen as hip_ in some settings, and certain brands carry cachet, but more often RTD is about personal convenience.|**Packaging**: sealed bottles or cans for _mobility and long shelf-life_. Often pre-mixed with milk/sugar or flavor (e.g. Starbucks Frappuccino bottles) to deliver a _complete taste experience_. **Design emphasis** on being _ready to consume_: no heat required for cold variants, drink straight from container. Brands often print the origin or brew method (e.g. “cold brewed for 18 hours”) to assure quality. Sizes are single-serve for quick use. These features meet the job of providing instant coffee gratification to busy consumers — reflecting a growing trend where _“ready-to-drink coffee is now a $3.4B category…offering busy consumers a blend of convenience [and] variety”_ ([|

| **Coffee Shop Brewed Coffee** – _e.g. Starbucks_ | **Functional:** _Outsourced convenience_ – someone else makes the coffee to your order. Quick caffeine fix when out and about. Also offers endless customization (extra shots, non-dairy milk, flavors) to meet any functional or dietary need. **Emotional:** Serves as a _personal treat or routine_ – the experience of having a favorite latte made for you. The café ambiance provides comfort or inspiration (a break from home/office) ([The “job” of the local coffee shop | by Drew Watkins | Cast & Hue](https://insights.castandhue.com/the-job-of-the-local-coffee-shop-a0a745584e99#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cgiving%20me%20fresh%20creative%20inspiration,people%2C%20or%20find%20creative%20inspiration)). For many, visiting the coffee shop is a _ritual that boosts their mood_. **Social:** Cafés provide a **social hub** – a place to meet, work, or simply be around others. Branded coffee cups (the Starbucks logoed cup) can also act as a _status symbol_, signaling one’s participation in a popular culture or a certain lifestyle. | **Service design**: baristas craft the drink, allowing infinite personalization (fulfilling “I want it _just right_” jobs). **Environment**: coffee chains like Starbucks design stores as welcoming “third places” with cozy seating, music, and décor to invite customers to linger and socialize ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20Starbucks%E2%80%99%20version%20of,date%20on%20a%20weekend%20afternoon)) ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Howard%20Schultz%20wrote%20an%20open,and%20responsibility%2C%20today%20and%20always%E2%80%9D)). Many cafes offer Wi-Fi and a work-friendly setup to serve those coming to work or study. Branding and naming (e.g. cup sizes, seasonal specials) create a sense of community and excitement. Starbucks explicitly positioned itself as _“a place where people could drink coffee, connect, and find a sense of belonging”_ – a **catalyst for community** beyond just the coffee itself ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20Starbucks%E2%80%99%20version%20of,date%20on%20a%20weekend%20afternoon)) ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Howard%20Schultz%20wrote%20an%20open,and%20responsibility%2C%20today%20and%20always%E2%80%9D)). These features collectively fulfill not only the drink’s job but also the emotional/social jobs (comfort, connection, status) that draw people to coffee shops. | | **Specialty Beans & Artisanal Coffee** – _e.g. Local artisan roasters, Third Wave coffee_ | **Functional:** Deliver the _highest-quality coffee experience_ for those who value flavor nuance and craft. Often purchased by hobbyist home brewers or served in specialty cafés, these products aim to **optimize taste and purity** (sometimes even at the expense of convenience). **Emotional:** Provide _excitement and pride_ of connoisseurship – customers enjoy discovering unique single-origin beans, perfecting brew techniques, and feeling passionate about coffee. It’s as much a hobby or identity as a beverage. **Social:** Fosters a _subculture/community_ of coffee enthusiasts. Appreciating fine coffee (like appreciating fine wine) can confer status in certain circles, and patrons often support ethical sourcing, aligning with social values (sustainability, fair trade) which provides a sense of doing good. | **Product design/features:** High-end **whole beans**, often single-origin or specialty grade, roasted with precision (lighter “third wave” roasts to highlight flavor notes ( [Coffee Is Cooler Than Ever. So Is the Third Wave Dead? | TASTE](https://tastecooking.com/coffee-cooler-ever-third-wave-dead/#:~:text=My%20fancy%20coffee%20belongs%20to,and%20Chemex%20pots%2C%20approached%20brewing) )). Packaging highlights origin, roast date, tasting notes, and sometimes farmer stories – enhancing the emotional connection and sense of uniqueness. These products typically require **manual brewing methods** (French press, pour-over, espresso machines) – engaging the user in a _brewing ritual_. Tools like gooseneck kettles and pour-over drippers appeal to the desire for precision ( [Coffee Is Cooler Than Ever. So Is the Third Wave Dead? | TASTE](https://tastecooking.com/coffee-cooler-ever-third-wave-dead/#:~:text=provenance%2C%20production%20methods%2C%20nuances%20in,degree%20of%20precision%20and%20intensity) ). **Cafés in this category** focus on craftsmanship: skilled baristas, latte art, and educating customers. The overall design serves the job of treating coffee as an _experience_ or craft: _“coffee became more like wine, with attention to provenance, production methods, and nuances in flavor…baristas approached brewing with new precision”_ ( [Coffee Is Cooler Than Ever. So Is the Third Wave Dead? | TASTE](https://tastecooking.com/coffee-cooler-ever-third-wave-dead/#:~:text=My%20fancy%20coffee%20belongs%20to,and%20Chemex%20pots%2C%20approached%20brewing) ). This fulfills the connoisseur’s functional job (excellent coffee) and emotional job (the joy of a perfected ritual), while also signaling membership in a specialty coffee culture.

_Table: Coffee product types mapped to the jobs-to-be-done they fulfill and the design features that enable those jobs._ Each product category is crafted to excel at certain jobs (and may compromise on others). For example, instant coffee sacrifices flavor complexity for speed, whereas specialty beans sacrifice convenience for quality. By understanding these trade-offs through JTBD, we see why the coffee market has so many formats – each is optimized for particular contexts, users, and “jobs.”

## Part 2: JTBD Applied to Coffee – Real-World Scenarios

To illustrate the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework in action, we can construct **JTBD story statements** for coffee. These follow the format **Situation – Motivation – Outcome**:

- **Situation:** When ___
    
- **Motivation:** I want to ___
    
- **Outcome:** So I can ___
    

Below are several common scenarios in which people “hire” coffee, framed in this format:

- **Morning Wake-Up:** _When_ I roll out of bed feeling groggy, _I want to_ drink a strong cup of coffee immediately, _so I can_ wake up fully and start my day alert.
    
- **Work/Study Focus:** _When_ I need to tackle a long study session or back-to-back meetings, _I want to_ have coffee to keep me energized and focused, _so I can_ maintain concentration and be productive for hours.
    
- **Relaxation Break:** _When_ I’m feeling stressed or drained in the afternoon, _I want to_ savor a comforting cup of coffee (maybe a latte or my favorite roast), _so I can_ relax and rejuvenate my mood.
    
- **Social Connection:** _When_ I meet up with a friend or colleague, _I want to_ get coffee together, _so I can_ have a casual, enjoyable setting that encourages good conversation and bonding.
    
- **Treat/Indulgence:** _When_ I crave a treat or reward, _I want to_ grab a specialty coffee drink (like a seasonal flavored latte or a Frappuccino), _so I can_ indulge myself and feel a small moment of joy.
    
- **On-the-Go Convenience:** _When_ I’m traveling or rushing between errands, _I want to_ pick up a quick coffee (or have a canned coffee with me), _so I can_ get an energy boost without slowing down.
    

Each of these mini-stories identifies a context (when), a motivation (want to), and a desired outcome (so I can). They highlight how the _core goals_ of coffee consumption vary by situation. We can categorize these goals into functional, emotional, and social dimensions:

### Core Functional Goals of Coffee

These are the practical jobs – the direct problem a coffee product solves for the customer:

- **Boost Energy and Alertness:** This is the quintessential functional goal. Coffee’s caffeine content provides stimulation to help users _stay awake, alert, and productive_. Whether it’s the first cup in the morning or a late-night study aid, many coffee purchases are fundamentally driven by _“I need to not feel tired right now.”_ In the JTBD lens, the coffee is _hired as an energy tool_. For example, a consumer might think, _“When I have a long afternoon meeting, I want a coffee, so I can keep my energy up and contribute effectively.”_ Indeed, one study noted that part of coffee’s role in daily routine is _“a nutritional intake, aiming to increase…alertness.”_ ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=,blood%20pressure%20or%20stimulate%20alertness))
    
- **Enhance Focus and Performance:** Closely related to energy, coffee is often used to improve mental performance – to sharpen one’s focus and clear the morning fog. This is a core job for students and professionals. The **functional chemistry** of caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, temporarily reducing fatigue. The desired outcome is being more efficient at work or studies (e.g. _“so I can write this report without losing concentration”_). Many product features (like **high-caffeine blends or “extra shot” espresso options**) are designed with this job in mind.
    
- **Convenient Hydration or Routine Beverage:** While not hydrating in the way water is, coffee does serve as a fluid intake and an enjoyable beverage with breakfast or during breaks. The _routine_ aspect is key – people incorporate coffee into daily schedules (morning commute cup, 10am coffee break, etc.) as a structured moment that also delivers some hydration and warmth. In some cases, coffee (especially black coffee or unsweetened cold brew) is hired as a low-calorie alternative to sugary drinks – effectively _“something flavorful to sip”_ that won’t break a diet.
    
- **Warmth and Physical Comfort:** On a cold day or when one feels chilly, a hot coffee is functionally hired to _warm the body_. This overlaps the emotional comfort goal, but from a functional perspective, a hot beverage raises body temperature and can make someone physically more comfortable. Many commuters in winter, for instance, might grab a hot coffee partly for this reason.
    
- **Easy Nutrition or Hunger Stalling:** In some cases, coffee (especially with milk/sugar or a latte) is used functionally to stave off hunger or as a light meal substitute. The classic example from JTBD theory is the milkshake study – commuters “hired” milkshakes to stay full and occupied on long drives ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=began%20to%20use%20this%20lens,you%E2%80%99re%20hungry%20for%201%20hour)). Similarly, someone might “hire” a calorie-rich coffee drink in the morning instead of breakfast. This is not a primary job for plain coffee, but **coffee-plus-calories** (like a vanilla latte or a butter coffee) can function this way. One might say, _“When I don’t have time for breakfast, I want a filling coffee drink, so I can get some calories and not feel hungry at work.”_
    

In summary, the functional jobs of coffee center on its **stimulant properties, convenience as a readily available beverage, and minor roles in comfort or hunger management**. Coffee products are designed to excel at these: e.g. instant coffee providing ultra-fast caffeine, large drip carafes offering ample supply for routine drinking, or espresso shots concentrating caffeine for a quick jolt.

### Emotional Goals of Coffee Consumption

Beyond the tangible benefits, coffee is intertwined with emotions and psychological needs. Key emotional jobs include:

- **Comfort and Stress Relief:** Coffee provides a moment of calm in a cup. The act of holding a warm mug, smelling the aroma, and tasting a familiar flavor can be very comforting. Many people use their coffee ritual as a way to _reduce stress or anxiety_. For example, stepping away from a hectic workplace to sit with a latte can help one feel rejuvenated. Researchers note that _“coffee has the strength to modify people’s feelings and mood”_ ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=has%20the%20capability%20to%20impact,114)). The emotional outcome might be relaxation, contentment, or a restored sense of “I can handle the day.”
    
- **Pleasure and Indulgence:** Drinking coffee, especially a favored type (a smooth espresso, a sweet mocha, etc.), simply brings _joy_ to many consumers. As one study found, coffee consumers commonly report **positive emotions** from coffee, such as _energy, satisfaction, and pleasure_ ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=main%20emotions%20and%20consumers%E2%80%99%20habits,positive%20emotions%20from%20coffee%20consumption)). Sometimes the job is basically _“I want something enjoyable for myself.”_ Coffee’s rich flavors and even the caffeine buzz can elevate mood. This indulgent role is clear with specialty concoctions (think seasonal pumpkin-spice lattes or decadent iced frappés) which are engineered to deliver happiness in addition to caffeine.
    
- **Habit and Routine – Feeling “Normal”:** There is a comforting emotional stability in the routine of coffee. People often say _“my day hasn’t started until I have my coffee.”_ This speaks to coffee’s job in providing a sense of normalcy and readiness. The _habit itself_ is emotionally reassuring. If the routine is disrupted (no morning coffee), the person may feel off or irritable – not just from caffeine withdrawal, but from a break in ritual. Thus, coffee is hired to _anchor the day_. Products like programmable coffee makers that have coffee ready at 6am cater to this need by seamlessly integrating into one’s morning routine.
    
- **Identity and Pride:** Emotional goals can also include the feelings of pride or self-expression tied to coffee choices. A coffee enthusiast takes pride in mastering their pour-over technique or in knowing the differences between origin beans. This fulfillment of _“I feel proud/educated/sophisticated”_ is an emotional job served by specialty coffee products and coffee education. Even the choice of where you buy coffee can feed into self-image – e.g. someone might emotionally resonate with _“I’m the kind of person who supports local roasters”_ or conversely _“I treat myself to Starbucks every morning because I’m worth it.”_ In each case, the coffee experience reinforces a desired self-perception. Gen Z consumers, for instance, often seek coffee experiences that reflect their personal style and creativity ([Gen Z's Sweet Takeover: How the Youngest Coffee Lovers are ...](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gen-zs-sweet-takeover-how-youngest-coffee-lovers-saskia-brussaard-gepsc#:~:text=,pronounced%20preference%20for%20sweet%20flavours)).
    
- **Exploration and Novelty:** For some, coffee drinking is emotionally rewarding as a small adventure – trying new flavors, café-hopping, seasonal drinks, etc. The job is to provide _excitement_ or break monotony. A consumer might think, _“I want to try a new coffee blend or recipe, so I can have a little adventure in my day.”_ Brands fulfill this by rotating offerings (limited edition coffees, monthly subscription samplers) to continually engage curiosity and delight.
    

In essence, coffee’s emotional jobs revolve around **making the customer feel a certain way** – comforted, delighted, confident, energized (beyond the physical effect), or even _“complete”_ as part of daily life. Coffee products target these feelings: cozy cafe atmospheres aim to relax you, flavorful drinks aim to spark joy, and consistent routines aim to provide security. As noted in one review, modern consumers often _“need to experience the whole context of emotions”_ from a product like coffee, not just its functional utility ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=subjected%20to%20a%20modernisation%20where,16)) ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=according%20to%20the%20different%20emotions,114)).

### Social and Social-Psychological Goals

Coffee has a strong social dimension, and many jobs-to-be-done are social or social-psychological in nature:

- **Facilitating Social Interaction:** One of coffee’s oldest jobs is as a _social lubricant_. A coffee break or a café visit creates a space for interaction that is more relaxed than an office conference room and more sober than a bar. People “get coffee” to chat, to conduct informal interviews, to catch up with friends, or to go on low-key dates. In these cases, the coffee (and the cafe environment) is hired to provide a context in which people can connect. For example, _“When I want to catch up with an old friend, I suggest meeting at a coffee shop, so we can talk for hours in a comfortable setting.”_ The social goal is to strengthen relationships or exchange ideas, and coffee is an enabler. Coffee shops are even seen as community hubs; as Starbucks described, a _“warm and welcoming third place”_ that fosters connections ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20Starbucks%E2%80%99%20version%20of,date%20on%20a%20weekend%20afternoon)) ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Howard%20Schultz%20wrote%20an%20open,and%20responsibility%2C%20today%20and%20always%E2%80%9D)).
    
- **Signaling Status or Sophistication:** What we drink and how we drink it can carry social signals. Carrying a certain brand’s cup or being knowledgeable about coffee can influence how others see us. Some consumers consciously or subconsciously use coffee as a _status symbol or identity marker_. For instance, a professional might offer to get colleagues Starbucks as a treat, associating themselves with a generous, trendy gesture. Another person might pride themselves on only drinking fair-trade single origin coffee, signaling discernment and ethics. Even something as small as ordering a complex espresso drink can be a way to _“showcase one’s personality”_ ([The “job” of the local coffee shop | by Drew Watkins | Cast & Hue](https://insights.castandhue.com/the-job-of-the-local-coffee-shop-a0a745584e99#:~:text=,the%20need%20to%20eliminate%20distractions)) or tastes. In group settings, ordering “just black coffee” might project simplicity and toughness, whereas ordering a flat white or a pour-over might project worldliness. These social judgments are subtle but real in many cultures. Companies tap into this by branding – e.g. Nespresso’s ads with George Clooney cultivate a suave, premium image that customers might align with.
    
- **Enabling Shared Experiences and Traditions:** Coffee is often central to group rituals – from the office coffee pot that everyone gathers around, to family traditions like “Sunday breakfast coffee” or cultural ceremonies (e.g. the Ethiopian coffee ceremony, Italian espresso culture, Turkish coffee readings). The job here is _to create a sense of belonging and shared culture_. As one research review noted, coffee moments can be _“an opportunity to socialize, a daily ritual, a part of special occasions”_ ([Functional Needs, Emotions, and Perceptions of Coffee Consumers and Non-Consumers](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5694#:~:text=behaviour%20is%20influenced%20by%20the,blood%20pressure%20or%20stimulate%20alertness)). By having a coffee product suitable for these situations (e.g. a large brew to serve guests, or a specific brewing style tied to a tradition), the makers fulfill the social goal of togetherness.
    
- **Reducing Social Barriers / Icebreaker:** Holding a cup of coffee can psychologically give people something to do with their hands and can reduce social awkwardness. In meetings, a coffee in hand can ease tension – it’s a conversational prop (“This is good coffee, where’s it from?”) or simply a comforting presence. In a way, coffee is _hired to make social situations feel more natural_. This extends even to virtual interactions – how often do people say “let’s grab coffee” as a way to initiate a connection or mentorship? The phrase itself has become synonymous with networking.
    
- **Community and Membership:** Being a “regular” at a coffee shop, or part of a coffee club, fulfills a social-psychological need to belong. Coffee products with loyalty programs or subscription services tap into this: customers feel part of a community of fellow coffee lovers. Starbucks famously capitalized on this by creating _Starbucks Rewards_ – the app not only tracks purchases but makes customers feel recognized (free birthday drink, tiers of membership). The social job is feeling valued and included by an organization or group. Similarly, local cafés often have intimate communities where the barista knows your name and order, yielding a sense of _personal connection_. One cafe-goer noted that among the needs fulfilled by spending time at a coffee shop was _“feeling connected to [the] community”_ ([The “job” of the local coffee shop | by Drew Watkins | Cast & Hue](https://insights.castandhue.com/the-job-of-the-local-coffee-shop-a0a745584e99#:~:text=,need%20to%20discover%20new%20music)).
    

In fulfilling social jobs, coffee’s role often goes beyond the cup: it’s the **context and culture around the coffee** that does the heavy lifting. Product features aimed at social goals include things like comfortable café layouts (encouraging people to sit and chat), large shareable drink sizes (the carafe for the office, the airpot for a party), and even social media-friendly branding (as in our earlier example of an “Instagrammable” coffee that sparks online social interaction ([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory#:~:text=Type%20one%3A%20Young%20girls,products%2C%20and%20very%20good%20lighting))).

### Features Designed to Serve Functional, Emotional, and Social Goals

Coffee product designers intentionally include features to target these functional, emotional, and social outcomes:

- **Caffeine Content and Variety:** To serve the _functional energy job_, products often advertise their caffeine content or offer extra-strong options. For example, some brands sell “double caffeine” coffee beans, and cafes offer extra espresso shots. On the flip side, they also offer **decaf** options – recognizing a different functional job (enjoy the taste/ritual without the stimulant, e.g. an evening coffee without ruining sleep). Decaf exists purely because some want the emotional/social aspects of coffee without the functional effect of caffeine, highlighting how product features align to specific jobs.
    
- **Brewing Speed and Ease:** A huge focus in coffee product innovation is reducing the time and effort to get a cup, directly targeting _convenience jobs_. Drip coffee makers with timers brew automatically each morning (so the _outcome_ “I can have my coffee the minute I wake up” is achieved). Single-serve pod machines were explicitly designed for _hassle-free, one-minute brewing_ ([Jobs to be Done Framework | by Juhi Garg | Medium](https://juhigarg.medium.com/jobs-to-be-done-framework-973c580a5833#:~:text=By%20focusing%20on%20the%20job,precious%20moments%20with%20her%20children)). Instant coffee is the pinnacle of convenience – just add water. Meanwhile, drive-through windows and mobile ordering at coffee shops (like the Starbucks app) are service features aimed at customers who say _“I want my coffee with zero wait.”_ Even the expansion of ready-to-drink coffees in grocery stores is an industry response to the job “give me coffee when I don’t have access to a cafe or machine.” In sum, **speed and ease features (automation, portability, instant mix, delivery services)** all serve the job of quick gratification.
    
- **Flavor and Customization Options:** To fulfill _emotional desires for pleasure and personalization_, coffee products come with myriad flavor choices and customizations. At cafes, you can choose milk type, flavor syrups, foam/no foam – this lets customers tailor the product to what makes them happiest or fits their diet. Coffee bean retailers offer different roast levels and origin profiles to cater to diverse palates (some prefer a chocolaty dark roast, others a fruity light roast). Even instant coffee has diversified into flavors (e.g. vanilla instant lattes). Seasonal specials (Pumpkin Spice Latte, holiday blends) create excitement and tap into emotions of nostalgia or seasonal joy. These features ensure that customers can _“get it just the way I like it,”_ which is often a core outcome for both emotional satisfaction and identity-expression jobs.
    
- **Packaging and Presentation:** The way coffee is packaged or presented ties into emotional and social goals. **Aesthetics** matter: Artisan roasters use minimalist or artful packaging to signal craft and quality (appealing to connoisseurs’ pride and the gift-giving market). Big brands like Starbucks change cup designs seasonally, which customers often eagerly anticipate – the red holiday cup has become a cultural symbol that sparks joy and social media chatter (an emotional/social payoff). Meanwhile, products aimed at convenience have packaging designed for ease: e.g. instant coffee single-serves you can tear and pour, or canned coffee with a resealable lid. Some packaging also plays up social responsibility (e.g. “100% Fair Trade” or recyclable materials) to address consumers’ **ethical/social values**, making them feel conscientious.
    
- **Cafe Environment & Service Elements:** Though not a feature of the coffee beverage itself, the _design of coffee shop spaces and service_ is a crucial part of fulfilling jobs, especially social/emotional ones. Comfortable seating, cool décor, communal tables or conversely quiet nooks, lighting, music choice – all are deliberately tuned to create a certain vibe (lively for socializing in one cafe, mellow for studying in another). Some coffee shops host events (open mic nights, book clubs) to strengthen community ties – going beyond the cup to fulfill social jobs. Drive-throughs and express pickup counters are service design features targeting the “fast and convenient” functional job. Latte art is a small feature that serves an emotional goal: it makes the customer smile and often leads them to share a photo (blending emotional delight with social sharing). As one customer needfinding insight showed, even _ambient factors_ like a café’s music can fulfill jobs (e.g. discovering new music while hanging out at a coffee shop) ([The “job” of the local coffee shop | by Drew Watkins | Cast & Hue](https://insights.castandhue.com/the-job-of-the-local-coffee-shop-a0a745584e99#:~:text=,need%20to%20discover%20new%20music)).
    

In summary, successful coffee products and services are **bundles of features aligned with specific jobs-to-be-done**. A single product rarely fulfills all jobs equally well. Instead, each optimizes certain outcomes: e.g. a Keurig machine optimizes convenience (functional) and a bit of personal indulgence (emotional), whereas a hip local café optimizes social and emotional experience, and a can of cold brew optimizes on-the-go functionality. The JTBD perspective helps us see why those design decisions make sense by linking them to the underlying goals of the customer.

### Market Positioning of Different Coffee Products & Brands

The coffee industry has evolved through “waves,” and different brands/categories position themselves by emphasizing the jobs they excel at. Let’s briefly examine a few:

- **Starbucks (Second Wave Coffee Chain):** Starbucks is a prime example of designing an offering around _emotional and social jobs_ as much as the functional. From the start, Starbucks didn’t just sell coffee; it sold a “coffee experience.” Howard Schultz described their stores as a “third place” – _“a place where people could drink coffee, connect, and find a sense of belonging”_ ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=Well%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20Starbucks%E2%80%99%20version%20of,date%20on%20a%20weekend%20afternoon)). Starbucks’ positioning focuses on providing a consistent, cozy environment worldwide, with friendly service and a menu of beverages for every taste. The brand fulfills functional jobs through convenience (proliferation of stores, mobile ordering, drive-thrus in many locations) and reliable quality, but truly differentiates on emotional appeal (the joy of a Frappuccino treat, the comfort of the smell and ambiance) and social cachet (the iconic green logo cup as a pop culture symbol). They also pioneered personalization (“Have it your way” with endless custom orders), which ties into customers’ emotional desire to feel special. That said, Starbucks has faced criticism too: as it scaled, some felt it lost the neighborhood community feel and became too standardized. During COVID-19, the chain pivoted more to on-the-go efficiency, removing seating – which, some argue, undermined the third-place experience ([Starbucks and the Myth of the Third Place](https://www.thepourover.coffee/starbucks-and-the-myth-of-the-third-place/#:~:text=But%20Starbucks%20didn%E2%80%99t%20stay%20true,linger%20as%20they%20once%20had)). The balance of jobs shifted: more pure functionality, less social lingering. This shows how market positioning can change: Starbucks is now trying to re-emphasize the cafe experience to recapture the social/emotional job it originally served so well.
    
- **Nespresso (Premium Coffee Pods):** Nespresso (by Nestlé) positions itself as the epitome of _“barista-quality coffee at home, made effortless.”_ Its marketing and design target customers who want a _gourmet experience (emotional)_ with _zero inconvenience (functional)_. Nespresso machines and capsules are portrayed as a sophisticated indulgence – the presence of actor George Clooney in ads and sleek “boutique” Nespresso stores in high-end locations underscore the _luxury and status_ element ([The good, the bad and the ugly: sustainability at Nespresso | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/27/nespresso-sustainability-transparency-recycling-coffee-pods-values-aluminum#:~:text=Nespresso%20introduced%20the%20first%20single,of%20espresso%20popular%20in%20Europe)) ([The good, the bad and the ugly: sustainability at Nespresso | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/27/nespresso-sustainability-transparency-recycling-coffee-pods-values-aluminum#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20very%20interesting%20for%20me%2C,%E2%80%9D)). The product itself is a capsule system that ensures a high degree of consistency and quality in each cup, addressing the functional job of making a great espresso without requiring skill. By focusing on espresso-based drinks, Nespresso aims at taste-conscious coffee lovers who might otherwise go to a cafe. It promises _“what else?”_ could you need if you have Nespresso. The brand also ties into social/ethical jobs by touting efforts like its AAA Sustainable Quality Program and recycling initiatives (to counter criticisms about pod waste) ([The good, the bad and the ugly: sustainability at Nespresso | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/27/nespresso-sustainability-transparency-recycling-coffee-pods-values-aluminum#:~:text=More%20broadly%2C%20Nespresso%20has%20since,standard%20market%20price%20for%20coffee)) ([The good, the bad and the ugly: sustainability at Nespresso | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/27/nespresso-sustainability-transparency-recycling-coffee-pods-values-aluminum#:~:text=When%20Nespresso%20coffee%20is%20packaged,and%20how%20much%20coffee%20is)). Nonetheless, a known criticism is the environmental impact of single-use aluminum pods – a pain point for eco-conscious consumers. Nespresso’s own analysis once argued that _instant coffee uses less energy and drip filter coffee has higher per-cup environmental impact_ than capsules, but that was met with skepticism given the source ([The good, the bad and the ugly: sustainability at Nespresso | Guardian sustainable business | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/27/nespresso-sustainability-transparency-recycling-coffee-pods-values-aluminum#:~:text=environmental%20footprint%20than%20capsule%20espresso,also%20makes%20Nescafe%20instant%20coffee)). In the market, Nespresso carved a premium niche (pricey machines, pods) distinct from its more utilitarian competitor Keurig (which took a similar concept mass-market in North America). Nespresso’s positioning thus heavily emphasizes **emotional luxury and a refined social identity**, on top of the core functional benefit of convenience.
    
- **Folgers (Mass-Market Home Brew):** Folgers, by contrast, is positioned as the _quintessential everyday coffee for the average American household_. Its famous slogan “The best part of wakin’ up is Folgers in your cup!” exemplifies targeting the **morning routine job** (['The Best Part of Wakin' Up': Folgers' Iconic Jingle Sells for $90,500](https://people.com/food/royalties-for-folgers-iconic-the-best-part-of-wakin-up-jingle-sells-for-90k/#:~:text=,is%20Folgers%20in%20your%20cup)). Folgers isn’t about sophistication or café culture; it’s about reliability, familiarity, and comfort. It appeals to those who want a straightforward, no-nonsense cup of coffee – often with a classic American breakfast. The brand’s marketing often features family scenes, home kitchens, or warm homecomings (like their long-running Christmas commercial), reinforcing coffee’s role in home-life rituals and emotional connections. The key jobs Folgers fulfills are functional (caffeine in the morning) and emotional (comfort of something consistent and nostalgic). Price point is kept affordable, making it accessible (financial convenience is a functional aspect too). Folgers has faced challenges as younger generations gravitate to more upscale or trendy options, but it remains a leader in the grocery coffee segment by essentially owning the “home nostalgia and morning starter” space. Any limitations? Folgers isn’t known for superb flavor (coffee aficionados might deride it as bland or stale compared to fresher beans). So it sacrifices the connoisseur job in favor of consistency and ease (it’s pre-ground, ready to brew with no fuss).
    
- **Local Artisan Roasters (Third Wave Coffee):** Local artisanal roasters and third-wave coffee shops position themselves almost opposite to Folgers – focused on quality, provenance, and expertise over convenience. Brands like Blue Bottle, Intelligentsia, Stumptown, or countless independent micro-roasters appeal to the _coffee enthusiast_ job: people who want coffee to be an experience and a passion. They emphasize things like single-origin beans, light roasting to bring out flavor notes, direct trade with farmers, and skilled brewing methods ( [Coffee Is Cooler Than Ever. So Is the Third Wave Dead? | TASTE](https://tastecooking.com/coffee-cooler-ever-third-wave-dead/#:~:text=My%20fancy%20coffee%20belongs%20to,and%20Chemex%20pots%2C%20approached%20brewing) ). The target customer is hiring coffee for the _ultimate taste and the story behind the cup_. Emotional and social goals are also in play: customers feel they are part of a craft movement and often enjoy being “in the know” about coffee. These roasters often foster community by hosting tasting events or educating customers (fulfilling social needs for belonging and shared interest). The market positioning here is usually premium: higher price for higher quality and ethics, which attracts consumers whose values align (social/environmental job of supporting sustainable, ethical products). A possible limitation in this category is accessibility – both in price and in ease. It may intimidate or alienate casual coffee drinkers (the menu might feel pretentious, or the black coffee too “acidic/fruity” for someone used to cream and sugar). Some third-wave brands have recognized this and started offering more approachable products (like Blue Bottle offering sugar-infused cold brews, or draft lattes blending craft with convenience) ( [Coffee Is Cooler Than Ever. So Is the Third Wave Dead? | TASTE](https://tastecooking.com/coffee-cooler-ever-third-wave-dead/#:~:text=The%20growing%20demand%20for%20cold,to%20a%20creamier%2C%20flatter%20mouthfeel) ) ( [Coffee Is Cooler Than Ever. So Is the Third Wave Dead? | TASTE](https://tastecooking.com/coffee-cooler-ever-third-wave-dead/#:~:text=Third,of%20cold%20brew%20concentrate%20to) ). Nonetheless, the artisan segment remains centered on _fulfilling the highest-end functional job (quality taste)_ and strong emotional jobs (excitement, passion, ethical satisfaction), while largely foregoing the convenience that other products deliver.
    
- **Keurig and Other Pod Systems:** While Nespresso took the high-end route, Keurig targeted offices and busy Americans broadly, making convenience its main pitch (the **functional job of “anyone can get a quick cup of their choice, no pot needed”**). Keurig’s positioning was “Your Perfect Cup” – each person gets their preferred style (addressing individual taste jobs) without having to brew a whole pot (solving a waste and convenience issue in offices). It succeeded in corporate and home environments where different people want different coffees – a social consideration (everyone can be happy, no one has to compromise on one communal brew). Keurig later faced backlash for the plastic K-cup waste (an environmental social issue), which the company has been working to mitigate with recyclable pods. In terms of emotional positioning, Keurig is less about luxury and more about _practical simplicity_ – it doesn’t carry the cachet of Nespresso, but it became ingrained in office culture and many homes by excelling at its core job (fast, hassle-free variety).
    
- **Ready-to-Drink and Novelty Brands:** Newer players in the market, like bottled cold brew makers or canned latte brands, position themselves on freshness, health, or niche functional benefits. For example, some cold brews are marketed as having _“smooth taste with less acidity”_ (appealing to a functional health angle – easier on the stomach). Others add protein, vitamins, or adaptogens, turning coffee into a _functional beverage for fitness or wellness_ crowds (a crossover job: energy + nutrition). These products often appeal to younger consumers who want convenience but also _“coffee with an edge”_. The **social image** of these products can be important – for instance, holding a stylish cold brew bottle in the office might mark one as a trendsetter. A Fast Company report noted that Gen Z is pushing coffee as a form of self-expression and looking for _creative, personalized coffee options_, including cold and sweet beverages and even things like dalgona coffee trends ([Gen Z's Sweet Takeover: How the Youngest Coffee Lovers are ...](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gen-zs-sweet-takeover-how-youngest-coffee-lovers-saskia-brussaard-gepsc#:~:text=,pronounced%20preference%20for%20sweet%20flavours)) ([Gen Z coffee and tea trends - FoodNavigator-USA.com](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2025/04/03/gen-z-coffee-and-tea-trends/#:~:text=usa,boosting%20and%20relaxation%2F)). RTD brands and trendy cafes (like those specializing in signature iced drinks) tap into that by positioning coffee almost like a lifestyle fashion item or a canvas for creativity. The limitation here might be that in focusing on novelty (say, a highly Instagrammable coffee drink), the core coffee quality might be secondary – critics might say these sweet concoctions are essentially “coffee-flavored sugar milk.” But for the job of attracting a new generation or providing an indulgent experience, they are successful.
    

Each category’s market positioning highlights certain jobs: **Starbucks** = consistency, comfort, and ubiquity (with a dose of social status); **Nespresso** = luxury, taste, and ease for home (personal indulgence with style); **Folgers** = tradition, simplicity, and morning routine; **Local roasters** = quality, ethics, connoisseurship and community; **Keurig** = individualized convenience in shared settings; **RTD and new players** = ultra-convenience and novel experiences. These positions show how companies align their messaging and development to the JTBD of their target segments. And often, when a brand tries to stretch to a job it wasn’t originally meant for, it encounters pushback (as seen when Starbucks leaned heavily into fast service at the cost of ambiance, or when any brand tries to be “all things to all people”).

### Do Coffee Products Fulfill Their Jobs Well? – Limitations and Criticisms

While coffee is a beloved multi-functional product, there are inherent limitations and trade-offs in how well any coffee product fulfills its intended jobs. Some noteworthy points include:

- **Trade-off Between Convenience and Quality:** As touched on earlier, products that maximize convenience (instant coffee, pods to an extent) often compromise on taste quality. Instant coffee, for example, is incredibly fast and easy – a top performer for the _“quick caffeine” job_ – but many consider its flavor inferior. This is because instant typically uses cheaper robusta beans and loses some aroma in processing ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=Mostly%20Made%20From%20Robusta)) ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=Owing%20to%20its%20source%20coffee,away%20some%20of%20its%20aromas)). The result: it _fully meets the functional need_ but may underperform on the emotional job of enjoyment for discerning drinkers. One source flatly states, _“the key advantage of instant coffee is its convenience and speed. Unfortunately, quality suffers in that regard.”_ ([Coffee Pods vs. Ground Coffee vs. Instant Coffee – Invigo Coffee Roasters](https://invigocoffee.com/en-us/blogs/news/coffee-pods-vs-ground-coffee-vs-instant-coffee?srsltid=AfmBOooM-lDBejZeCU9DDEiM-9IBB5BA_lcLjiDHOmLlsU98YMusLow9#:~:text=This%20is%20largely%20due%20to,beans%20in%20favour%20of%20volume)). Pods improved quality somewhat, but even they may not satisfy a coffee purist the way freshly ground beans do ([Are pods (e.g Nespresso) as good as coffee grounds/powder? - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/d19c7y/are_pods_eg_nespresso_as_good_as_coffee/#:~:text=In%20my%20experience%2C%20no%2C%20not,often%20cannot%20match%20the%20quality)). Conversely, pursuing the ultimate quality (say, hand-brewed specialty coffee) means it’s less convenient – it takes time, skill, and equipment. So, consumers often choose a product that fits which side of this convenience vs. quality job spectrum matters more to them.
    
- **Habituation and Diminished Functional Returns:** For the “energy/alertness” job, a limitation is the body’s adaptation to caffeine. Regular coffee drinkers build tolerance, meaning over time that morning cup may not deliver the same boost it used to. Some people end up increasing intake (multiple cups a day), which can lead to other issues (jitters, disrupted sleep cycles – which ironically creates _more_ need for coffee). So while coffee reliably fulfills the wake-up job in the short run, its effectiveness can diminish for heavy users, or lead to a dependency cycle. Products try to address this by offering higher caffeine options (extra bold roasts, energy drink hybrids), but ultimately there is a physiological cap. Additionally, too much caffeine can overshoot the job – instead of focused energy, one gets anxiety and shakiness, undermining the very productivity goal they had. Finding the right balance is a user challenge, not the product’s fault per se, but it is a limitation of using coffee as an alertness tool.
    
- **Overemphasis on Sugar and Calories:** Many coffee products that aim to maximize emotional appeal (sweet taste, comfort) end up essentially as high-sugar desserts. A venti flavored latte or bottled Frappuccino can contain a significant portion of one’s daily sugar/fat intake. While these fulfill the _“indulgence” job_ splendidly, they conflict with any health-related jobs (if a consumer also expects coffee to be a low-calorie pick-me-up). There’s a criticism that coffee chains have “invented” a series of liquid desserts under the guise of coffee, potentially contributing to unhealthy diets. This represents a situation where fulfilling one job (treating oneself) can undermine another implicit job (perhaps staying healthy or hydrated). The market is adjusting with more sugar-free or light options, but the tastiest offerings still tend to be caloric.
    
- **Social and Environmental Externalities:** From a social perspective, while coffee shops aim to be welcoming third places, not everyone always feels included. Some high-end cafes can intimidate newcomers (the job of feeling comfortable may fail if the vibe is too elitist or the menu too confusing). On the flip side, popular chain cafes can get overcrowded or noisy, making it hard to use them for the intended “relax or focus” jobs. A Cast & Hue analysis noted a common _frustration_ for coffee shop goers: _“never being able to find a seat when one goes to get coffee.”_ As frustration increases, the product (coffee shop) fails the user’s job, pushing them to seek alternatives ([The “job” of the local coffee shop | by Drew Watkins | Cast & Hue](https://insights.castandhue.com/the-job-of-the-local-coffee-shop-a0a745584e99#:~:text=,of%20the%20competitor%20%E2%80%94%20are)). This is a classic JTBD insight: if a coffee shop’s environment no longer does the job (e.g., too busy to sit, or no outlets for your laptop), the customer may “fire” it and go elsewhere.  
    On the environmental front, products like disposable K-cups, takeaway cups, and the global supply chain of coffee raise concerns. Eco-conscious customers assign a job to products now too – _“help me reduce my environmental impact”_ or at least _“not make me feel guilty.”_ Many coffee products historically failed at this (billions of non-recyclable K-Cups were trashed annually, leading the inventor of K-Cups to express regret). This has spurred innovations: recyclable or compostable pods, reusable cups discounts, direct trade coffee to ensure farmers are paid fairly (social sustainability). Brands that adapt can better fulfill the ethical social job, whereas those that don’t might lose customers who “hire” an alternative like brewing at home with reusable filters, etc.
    
- **Health and Dependence Issues:** While moderate coffee consumption is generally considered safe (and even linked with some health benefits), excessive use can have negative effects – anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations in sensitive individuals, dependency headaches, etc. For some, coffee might fail the job of “help me feel good” if it exacerbates stress or disrupts sleep. There’s also the subset of people who love coffee but can’t tolerate caffeine (which is why decaf exists – to serve them). And some people experience heartburn or stomach issues from coffee’s acidity. These limitations mean coffee isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. In JTBD terms, a portion of the market has the job “get an energy boost without upsetting my stomach or making me jittery,” and traditional coffee doesn’t fit well – leading to competitors like tea, matcha, or newer mushroom coffee alternatives for those folks. Coffee brands have responded with things like low-acid coffee or adding calming ingredients (some specialty lattes now include adaptogenic herbs to smooth the caffeine kick ([Gen Z coffee and tea trends - FoodNavigator-USA.com](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2025/04/03/gen-z-coffee-and-tea-trends/#:~:text=usa,boosting%20and%20relaxation%2F))), but those are niche solutions.
    
- **Changing Consumer Preferences:** Lastly, the job landscape itself can change, especially across generations. As noted, Gen Z consumers place different weights on jobs – they often prefer cold, custom drinks (functional for year-round consumption and taste), want _“coffee that boosts mood or has wellness benefits”_ ([Gen Z coffee and tea trends - FoodNavigator-USA.com](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2025/04/03/gen-z-coffee-and-tea-trends/#:~:text=usa,boosting%20and%20relaxation%2F)), and use coffee as an expression (social media, identity) more than as a daily habit enforced by tradition. If coffee products don’t evolve to fulfill these emerging jobs, they risk losing relevance. For instance, a traditional brand like Folgers may not appeal to a young person who wants an iced oat-milk caramel coffee – Folgers wasn’t designed for that job. This is why we see mainstream brands launching new lines (Folgers now has specialty lines and Starbucks heavily markets cold brew and at-home products) to cover the new jobs.
    

In conclusion, coffee products have been remarkably successful at embedding themselves into consumers’ lives by serving a wide spectrum of jobs-to-be-done – from the purely functional need for caffeine, to rich emotional desires for comfort, to social needs for connection and status. The diversity of coffee formats and brands in the market is a direct reflection of the diverse jobs people expect coffee to do. Using the JTBD framework, we can appreciate why someone might **“hire” a quick instant coffee in one situation and a handcrafted pour-over in another** – the circumstances and desired outcomes differ, so the chosen “employee” (coffee product) must differ. While no single coffee product perfectly fulfills every job, the industry as a whole continues to innovate features and experiences to better serve our functional, emotional, and social needs. And every morning, millions of people will continue to hire that cup of coffee to get the job done – _whatever_ their personal job may be.
