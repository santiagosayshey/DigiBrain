I’ll conduct a deep research study on coffee as a product using the Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) framework. This will cover:

1. Customer needs and how they drive adoption of coffee across different global markets and customer segments.
2. Analysis of coffee's functional, emotional, and social goals in JTBD form:
    - When... / I want to... / So I can...
3. Comparison with substitute products (e.g., coffee pills, energy drinks, nootropics, teas, etc.):
    - Their features, market positions, how they meet or fail to meet needs, and limitations.

I’ll structure the report clearly with headers, tables comparing coffee and substitutes, and explicit examples of JTBD statements for different user personas.

I’ll let you know as soon as the research is ready!

# Coffee in the Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework: A Global Analysis

**Coffee (the drink)** is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and consumers “hire” coffee to fulfill various jobs in their lives ([Caffeine Use and Attentional Engagement in Everyday Life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666518224000068#:~:text=Caffeine%20Use%20and%20Attentional%20Engagement,In%20the)). The Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) framework helps us understand **why** people across different markets and segments choose coffee – what _functional tasks_ it helps them accomplish, what _emotional experiences_ it provides, and what _social roles_ it plays. This report explores the customer needs driving coffee consumption globally, formulates these insights in JTBD format, and compares how coffee and its substitutes (e.g. energy drinks, caffeine pills, nootropics, matcha, yerba mate, etc.) meet those needs.

## Customer Needs Driving Coffee Consumption

Coffee’s popularity can be traced to its ability to satisfy key customer needs across functional, emotional, and social dimensions. These needs may vary by consumer segment (students, professionals, athletes, parents, etc.) and by culture (from Italian espresso rituals to Middle Eastern hospitality). Below, we identify major goals in each category and express them as JTBD statements (Situation → Motivation → Expected Outcome).

### Functional Goals of Coffee Consumption

([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory)) _A young professional “hires” coffee as a morning tool to boost alertness and productivity while working ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for))._

Functionally, coffee is a tool for getting things done – largely due to its caffeine content and energizing effect. Across the world, people consume coffee to **increase alertness, focus, and physical energy**, effectively using it as a fuel to power through tasks ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for)). It’s also used for _symptom management_ – for example, to relieve a groggy feeling or even to stave off a caffeine-withdrawal headache ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=the%20CFA%20were%20modified,The) ). Different segments rely on coffee’s functional benefits in specific scenarios:

- **When I wake up feeling groggy in the morning, I want to drink a strong cup of coffee so I can feel alert and energized to start my workday productively** ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for)). _(Busy professionals worldwide “hire” coffee as a morning kick-start to improve alertness and performance.)_
    
- **When I’m a student cramming late at night for an exam, I want to have coffee so I can stay awake and maintain my focus to absorb the study material** ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for)). _(Students use coffee as a study aid to fight fatigue and extend concentration.)_
    
- **When I hit an afternoon slump at the office, I want a coffee break so I can recharge my energy and concentrate through my remaining meetings** ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for)). _(Employees often turn to coffee to sustain productivity through dips in energy.)_
    
- **When I’m about to exercise or head into athletic training, I want to consume coffee so I can boost my endurance and alertness for a better workout** ([If Coffee Makes You Anxious, Let These Matcha Converts Convince ...](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/coffee-makes-anxious-let-matcha-080023420.html#:~:text=If%20Coffee%20Makes%20You%20Anxious%2C,%E2%80%9D)). _(Athletes and fitness enthusiasts may use coffee as a legal performance enhancer to accomplish physical goals.)_
    
- **When I feel a headache coming on from skipping my usual caffeine, I want to grab a quick coffee so I can eliminate the pain and feel normal again** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine?

Across global markets, the core functional “job” of coffee – providing an energy/focus boost – is remarkably universal. In an international survey of caffeine motives, “alertness” was identified as the top reason for consuming coffee ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for)). Even in cultures with traditional tea habits, coffee is increasingly adopted for its functional efficacy. For instance, China’s younger professionals have embraced coffee as a productivity tool, with many reporting it helps them get through long work hours (in addition to its trendy appeal) ([Rise of Coffee Culture in China. For centuries, tea has been an integral… | by Chee Loh | Medium](https://cheeloh.medium.com/from-tea-to-coffee-the-rise-of-coffee-culture-in-china-b5cef5ab488f#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20primary%20reasons,experiences%20and%20preferences%20for%20coffee)) ([Rise of Coffee Culture in China.

However, it’s worth noting that heavy reliance on coffee can have downsides: high caffeine intake can cause jitters, insomnia, or acid reflux if overused ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=amounts%20,which%20can%20lead%20to%20temporary)) ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=Some%20people%2C%20especially%20those%20who,or%20a%20faster%20heart%20rate)). Consumers must balance the functional benefits with these limitations, which we will compare with other products later.

### Emotional Goals of Coffee Consumption

([Understand your product and customer better by the “Jobs-to-be-done” theory.-Torch Coffee Labs](https://www.torchcoffee.asia/blog-1/2017/5/19/understand-your-product-and-customer-better-by-the-jobs-to-be-done-theory)) _A busy parent savors a quick coffee moment amid chaos, seeking comfort and a mood lift to cope with her day ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Habit%20Alertness%20Mood%20Social%20Taste,789) ) ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine?

Beyond its utility, coffee delivers rich emotional experiences. Many people “hire” coffee for how it makes them **feel** – the comfort of the warm cup, the enjoyment of flavor and aroma, or the mood boost from caffeine. Studies find that emotional motivations like _mood enhancement, habit, and taste_ are significant factors in coffee consumption ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Questionnaire%20and%20the%20Caffeine%20Consumption,factors%20varied%20in%20importance%20in) ) ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine?

Coffee often becomes a _ritual_ that provides psychological comfort and a sense of normalcy in one’s day ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=the%20CFA%20were%20modified,The) ). Here are some emotional JTBD examples across different contexts:

- **When I feel stressed or overwhelmed at work, I want to take a coffee break so I can relax for a moment and calm my mind before resuming tasks** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,369) ). _(The act of sipping coffee in a quiet moment can relieve tension and improve one’s mood, providing a small oasis of calm.)_
    
- **When it’s a chilly, rainy afternoon, I want to brew a cup of coffee at home so I can feel cozy and comforted by its warmth and familiar aroma** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Habit%20Alertness%20Mood%20Social%20Taste,789) ). _(Coffee serves as a source of emotional comfort – the smell and taste evoke positive feelings or memories for many.)_
    
- **When I need a pick-me-up treat during a long day, I want to indulge in a flavorful latte or sweet iced coffee so I can lift my mood and feel a bit pampered** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,369) ). _(Specialty coffees act as affordable little “luxuries” that make the drinker feel happier and indulged without great expense.)_
    
- **When my daily routine feels off balance, I want my regular morning coffee so I can feel “right” and ready – it’s a ritual that centers me at the start of the day** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=the%20CFA%20were%20modified,The) ). _(The habitual aspect of coffee – the same mug, same brew every morning – provides emotional stability and satisfaction.)_
    
- **When I smell freshly brewed coffee, I want to drink it so I can savor the taste I love and enjoy the uplift in my mood and energy** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,369) ) ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine?

Different segments emphasize different emotional jobs. For example, **younger adults** might gravitate toward sugary coffee drinks or trendy café experiences as a mood booster or reward, whereas **older adults** often value the comforting routine of a simple cup (hence older groups score higher on “habit” motives) ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Questionnaire%20and%20the%20Caffeine%20Consumption,factors%20varied%20in%20importance%20in) ) ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine?

In some cultures, coffee’s emotional role is intertwined with tradition: in Ethiopia’s coffee ceremony, for instance, the process of brewing and sharing coffee is a slow, respectful ritual that brings satisfaction and a sense of community belonging ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=3,event%2C%20symbolizing%20hospitality%20and%20respect)). Overall, coffee excels at providing a mix of stimulation and solace – a combination that few other beverages offer to the same degree. This unique emotional duality (invigorating yet comforting) is a key reason why consumers continue to prefer coffee for an emotional lift ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Mood%20factor%20includes%20items%20about,items%20that%20related%20to%20the) ).

### Social Goals of Coffee Consumption

Coffee is not just a drink; it’s a **social catalyst and cultural symbol**. People around the world use coffee to connect with others, to create a certain image of themselves, or to participate in communal rituals ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=8,than%20just%20the%20caffeine%20fix)) ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=9,ceremonies%2C%20reflecting%20generosity%20and%20respect)). In JTBD terms, coffee is often “hired” to do social jobs – from facilitating conversation to signaling one’s lifestyle. Social motivations can include wanting to fit in with a group, to show hospitality, or to partake in a shared experience. Consider these social JTBD scenarios:

- **When I meet up with a friend I haven’t seen in a while, I want to catch up over coffee so we can have a relaxed conversation and strengthen our friendship** ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=8,than%20just%20the%20caffeine%20fix)). _(Meeting at a café or over a coffee at home is a socially accepted way to bond in many cultures – coffee gives a reason to gather and talk.)_
    
- **When I join my coworkers on a break, I want to grab a coffee too so I can be part of the office camaraderie and not feel left out of the group** ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,762) ). _(In workplace culture, the “coffee break” is an important social leveler – drinking coffee together fosters informal dialogue and team connection.)_
    
- **When I’m hosting visitors at my home, I want to serve them coffee (or espresso) so I can make them feel welcome and show hospitality** ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=9,ceremonies%2C%20reflecting%20generosity%20and%20respect)). _(In many regions – from Middle Eastern households serving **qahwa** to Europeans offering an after-dinner espresso – serving coffee to guests is a sign of respect and generosity.)_
    
- **When I go to a café in a new city, I want to order the local coffee so I can experience the culture and feel like I’m part of the community** ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=5,making%20it%20a%20leisurely%20affair)) ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=9,ceremonies%2C%20reflecting%20generosity%20and%20respect)). _(Coffee culture is a window into local lifestyles – whether it’s leisurely café au lait in France or a Japanese kissaten pour-over, partaking signals participation in local social rhythms.)_
    
- **When I carry a Starbucks cup into a meeting, I want to be seen with my coffee so I can project an image of a busy, driven professional (and maybe spark casual chat about coffee)** ([Rise of Coffee Culture in China. For centuries, tea has been an integral… | by Chee Loh | Medium](https://cheeloh.medium.com/from-tea-to-coffee-the-rise-of-coffee-culture-in-china-b5cef5ab488f#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20primary%20reasons,experiences%20and%20preferences%20for%20coffee)). _(Branded coffee has even become a status symbol in some contexts – for example, in China, young urbanites view coffee as a trendy, cosmopolitan accessory ([Rise of Coffee Culture in China.

Having a cup in hand can subtly convey that one is modern and industrious.)_
    

Globally, coffee’s social role is profound. In Sweden, the tradition of **fika** (coffee break with pastries) is as much about socializing as it is about the beverage – it’s a daily ritual of togetherness and pause from work ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=8,than%20just%20the%20caffeine%20fix)). In the Middle East, offering Arabic coffee in small cups is central to hospitality, symbolizing generosity and respect ([A World of Coffee: Brewing Traditions Across Cultures](https://themochamonkey.com/blogs/buzz/a-world-of-coffee-brewing-traditions-across-cultures?srsltid=AfmBOor5OuOJlUK6ZOmFAvKYIOogGegi9EUp44jSrGVeFCo16-LWa_to#:~:text=9,ceremonies%2C%20reflecting%20generosity%20and%20respect)). Even in predominantly tea-drinking cultures, coffee is making inroads by associating itself with youthful social trends (e.g., fashionable café hangouts in China, often shared on social media) ([Rise of Coffee Culture in China. For centuries, tea has been an integral… | by Chee Loh | Medium](https://cheeloh.medium.com/from-tea-to-coffee-the-rise-of-coffee-culture-in-china-b5cef5ab488f#:~:text=increasing%20influence%20of%20western%20culture,experiences%20and%20preferences%20for%20coffee)) ([Rise of Coffee Culture in China.

Notably, coffee’s social “job” can also have a flipside: those who don’t drink coffee might feel socially excluded or may choose an alternative drink just to have something in hand during a coffee-centric meetup. This underscores how deeply coffee is ingrained as a social norm in many places ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,762) ). Overall, coffee excels in fulfilling social goals because it’s universally recognizable and carries positive social connotations – it’s a social lubricant, a culture in itself, and even a statement about one’s identity or lifestyle.

## Coffee and Its Alternatives: Meeting the Same Jobs

Given the variety of jobs coffee is hired for, it faces competition from other products that attempt to fulfill similar needs. Globally, consumers choose not only between different types of coffee (espresso, instant, cold brew, etc.) but also between **substitute products** like energy drinks, caffeine pills, nootropic supplements, tea (including matcha), yerba mate, and more. Each alternative has its own market position, features, and strengths/weaknesses relative to coffee. Below, we explore how these products compare in meeting functional, emotional, and social customer needs. Table 1 provides a high-level summary of this comparison, followed by detailed analysis for each product.

**Table 1.** Comparison of Coffee and Substitute Products on Key Customer Goals (Functional, Emotional, Social) and Limitations.





**Coffee** remains the benchmark, excelling across all three goal categories – it reliably delivers a caffeine boost, it is beloved for its taste and emotional resonance, and it’s woven into the social fabric of many societies. That said, the alternatives above find their niches by outperforming coffee on certain jobs or catering to specific preferences/constraints. Below, we delve deeper into each alternative to see how and why consumers might “hire” them instead of coffee.

### Coffee: The Benchmark Beverage

Before comparing alternatives, it’s worth summarizing why **coffee itself** holds such a dominant position. Coffee’s global market was valued around $100 billion in 2024, reflecting its massive adoption ([Coffee Market Size, Growth, Trends & Demand by 2033](https://straitsresearch.com/report/coffee-market#:~:text=The%20global%20coffee%20market%20size,85%20Billion%20by%202033%2C)). It is the primary source of caffeine for many and is available in myriad forms (espresso, filter coffee, instant, etc.) to suit different needs. Coffee uniquely balances **functional efficacy** (high caffeine for alertness) with **emotional and social benefits** (enjoyment and culture). It contains antioxidants and other compounds that contribute to perceived health benefits (like lowered disease risks in moderate consumption) ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=A%202017%20study%20found%20significant,for%20the%20following%20conditions%20were)) ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=to%20take%20too%20much)).

However, coffee has its **limitations**. Its high caffeine can cause nervousness, rapid heartbeat, or anxiety, especially in sensitive individuals or if taken in excess ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=For%20Anxiety)). The acidity of coffee may lead to heartburn or digestive upset in some ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=amounts%20,which%20can%20lead%20to%20temporary)). Its effectiveness can wane with habitual use as people build tolerance, leading to dependence (and morning headaches without it) ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=adults%2C%20meaning%20that%20if%20you,if%20it%27s%20not%20available)). These drawbacks prompt some consumers to seek alternatives that either provide a _stronger boost_ or a _smoother experience_. Additionally, not everyone enjoys coffee’s bitter taste or the calories in sugar-laden coffee drinks, which opens the door for substitutes.

In terms of **customer goals**, coffee is a strong all-rounder: it clearly meets functional goals (as confirmed by research where “alertness” is the number one motive for coffee drinkers ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20this%20study,to%20college%20students%20sufficiently%20for))), it contributes to emotional goals (coffee can “improve my mood” ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,369) ) and is an “enjoyable habit” ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Habit%20Alertness%20Mood%20Social%20Taste,789) )), and it fulfills social goals (“important in social situations” ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=M6%20,762) ) and widely used in group settings). Thus, any alternative product often positions itself either as _healthier_, _more convenient_, or _more potent_, while trying to mimic some of coffee’s emotional/social appeal. Below we examine each.

### Energy Drinks

**Energy drinks** like Red Bull, Monster, and others represent a fast-growing segment (nearly $80 billion global market in 2024) ([Energy Drinks Market Size, Share & Growth Report, 2030](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/energy-drinks-market#:~:text=Energy%20Drinks%20Market%20Size%2C%20Share,the%20energy%20drinks%20market)), competing directly with coffee for the “keep me energized” job. They typically contain caffeine comparable to or higher than coffee (from ~80 mg up to 250+ mg in large cans) ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=following%20products%20are%3A)), often combined with large amounts of sugar and additives (B-vitamins, taurine, etc.). The key **functional appeal** of energy drinks is convenience and potency: they are ready-to-drink, **portable**, and can be consumed quickly for a rapid boost. Athletes, students, and night-shift workers may choose energy drinks when they need **immediate, strong stimulation** and perhaps when they don’t like hot beverages. For example, a fatigued driver might chug a canned energy drink at a rest stop instead of brewing coffee.

However, energy drinks generally **fall short on emotional and social jobs** compared to coffee. They are usually fizzy and sweet, consumed cold out of a can – this offers refreshment and maybe a brief enjoyable taste, but lacks the comforting warmth or rich aroma that coffee lovers cherish. Emotionally, users might feel a **rush or excitement** (some enjoy the burst of sugar and caffeine), but this can be followed by a “crash” as blood sugar spikes then dips. The branding of energy drinks often targets adrenaline and youth culture – which can instill a sense of edgy coolness for some (e.g. the association with extreme sports or gaming gives an emotional thrill). Yet, for others the **emotional connotation is negative**, associated with jitters or being unhealthy.

Socially, energy drinks are **niche**. Among teenagers and young adults, sharing energy drinks or the lore of “pulling an all-nighter with Monster” is a subculture, but it’s not a broad social ritual like coffee. You wouldn’t host guests with energy drinks or have an “energy drink corner” at the office the way you have a coffee pot. In fact, openly relying on energy drinks in a professional setting might be viewed as immature or desperate. Thus, energy drinks primarily fulfill **functional jobs** (quick energy) and do so **effectively**, but they compromise on other dimensions. As one health source notes, _“These drinks are generally not the best choice when looking for something with caffeine. They tend to be high in sugar…and have a large amount of caffeine”_ ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=consumer)). The drawbacks include potential health risks (excess sugar, high calories, and in rare cases heart arrhythmias in susceptible individuals), regulatory scrutiny in some countries, and the lack of a sustained energy (the sugar/caffeine combo can lead to a sharp crash). For those who need the function without the frills, energy drinks are a potent coffee substitute, but they rarely become a beloved _habit_ in the way coffee is.

### Caffeine Pills

Caffeine pills (or tablets) are a no-nonsense alternative for those who want pure functionality. Typically containing 100–200 mg caffeine each (equivalent to 1–2 cups of coffee) ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=following%20products%20are%3A)), these pills are used by some students, truck drivers, military personnel, or anyone who needs to stay awake and alert without drinking liquids. The **market position** of caffeine pills is relatively small – they are often sold as supplements or over-the-counter stimulants, not mainstream beverages. People “hire” caffeine pills almost exclusively for the **core functional job**: **staying awake and focused**. For example, a medical resident working a 24-hour shift might pop a caffeine pill at 3am to remain vigilant, as an alternative to constantly sipping coffee.

The **functional effectiveness** of caffeine pills is high. They deliver a known dose of caffeine (unlike coffee or energy drinks, which can vary) ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=,30%20to%2050%20mg)), and do so quickly (capsules dissolve fast). They also avoid issues like having to find a restroom frequently – a pill is small volume. As a result, a caffeine pill can be more convenient in situations where drinking coffee is impractical (e.g. long road trips or exams where you can’t leave your seat often).

However, **pills score extremely low on emotional and social dimensions**. There is no enjoyment in taking a caffeine pill – no taste, no ritual, and perhaps even a slight stigma or feeling that one is self-medicating. One doesn’t savor a caffeine pill; it’s purely a means to an end. Consequently, it doesn’t improve mood beyond what caffeine chemically induces, and it certainly doesn’t provide comfort or indulgence. Socially, caffeine pills are usually taken in private. In fact, someone might hide the fact they’re using them, since it might be viewed as having a caffeine “dependency” or an almost clinical approach to staying awake. You can’t bond with a friend over a caffeine pill like you would over a nice cup of coffee or tea.

In terms of **limitations**, caffeine pills carry the same physiological side effects as caffeine from other sources, but with higher risk of misuse. Because they are concentrated and easy to take, one could **accidentally overdose** (taking a second pill too soon, etc.), leading to severe jitters or worse. As a health article notes, “the pills are so concentrated that it is easy to take too much” ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=,30%20to%2050%20mg)). There are also no additional benefits – unlike coffee or tea which have antioxidants and can be part of a pleasant routine, a pill is stripped of any ancillary positives. For most people, caffeine pills are a backup option (for emergencies or extreme circumstances) rather than a daily driver. They fulfill the same _functional job_ as coffee (and very well), but **fail to deliver on emotional or social jobs**, which is why coffee remains more popular.

### Nootropics and Other Stimulants

“Nootropics” is a broad term covering various **cognitive enhancers** – from prescription wakefulness drugs like modafinil (Provigil) or ADHD medications, to over-the-counter supplements like L-theanine, ginseng, or proprietary brain-boost blends. While not as commonly used as coffee or tea, nootropics represent an alternative path to achieving the **functional goals** people seek from coffee: enhanced alertness, focus, memory, and mental clarity. Their **market position** is mostly niche but growing among professionals, students, and biohackers who are looking for an edge beyond what coffee can provide.

On the high end, **prescription nootropics** such as modafinil are known to be very potent. For instance, modafinil (originally developed for narcolepsy) can keep an individual awake and focused for many hours. It’s been noted that a standard dose of modafinil is roughly as effective for wakefulness as **600 mg of caffeine** (roughly two large coffees), _“but does not induce the shakiness, feelings of anxiety, or frequent trips to the bathroom that excessive caffeine can”_ ([Wake Up and Smell the Modafinil | Emergency Physicians Monthly](https://epmonthly.com/article/wake-smell-modafinil/#:~:text=A%20dose%20of%20modafinil%20is,bathroom%20that%20excessive%20caffeine%20can)). This means functionally, a drug like modafinil can _surpass coffee’s abilities_ – it provides sustained alertness without the classic caffeine side effects (no jitters, less diuretic effect). Some tech workers or students use modafinil during crunch times to maintain productivity well beyond normal limits.

Other nootropics, like certain amino acids (e.g. L-theanine, which is actually naturally in tea) or herbal supplements (ginkgo biloba, rhodiola rosea, etc.), claim to improve aspects of cognitive function or stress tolerance. These are often used in combination with caffeine or alone to mimic some benefits of coffee _without_ the anxiety. For example, a L-theanine supplement can be taken with caffeine to promote a calmer focus – effectively trying to reproduce the gentler effect of tea or matcha (which naturally combine theanine and caffeine) ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=Matcha%20is%20generally%20a%20better,without%20the%20risk%20of%20anxiousness)).

When it comes to **emotional and social goals**, however, nootropics are generally **poor substitutes** for coffee. Taking a pill or capsule (which many nootropics are) has no social ritual – it’s a solitary act. There’s also little _sensory pleasure_ or comfort; one doesn’t relish the experience of swallowing a supplement. The emotional satisfaction from nootropics might come as _confidence or relief_ (“Great, I’m super alert and productive now”), but it’s not the cozy, joyful feeling of sipping a favorite latte. In some cases, certain stimulants can even produce euphoria or mood lift (e.g. some people feel mildly euphoric on modafinil or amphetamine-based meds), but those are side effects rather than the kind of measured contentment coffee might bring. Socially, openly using strong nootropics can be stigmatized – e.g., using Adderall without a prescription is illegal and considered drug abuse, not something you’d discuss over breakfast. Even a legal nootropic like modafinil is not commonly a topic of casual conversation or a communal activity. Thus, these fulfill the _personal functional job_ but not the _shared social job_.

**Limitations** of nootropics vary widely. Prescription stimulants and eugeroics (like modafinil) are regulated substances – they can be expensive and require a doctor’s approval (except on gray markets). They also have side effects: modafinil might cause headaches or insomnia if taken too late; other stimulants have risks of dependence, cardiovascular strain, etc. Many over-the-counter nootropic supplements have less concrete evidence of efficacy and might simply be ineffective for some. Furthermore, relying on these can deprive one of the ancillary benefits of coffee/tea (antioxidants, enjoyment) as well as potentially overshoot – one might find themselves too wired or too focused (narrowed attention) in a way that isn’t actually pleasant or socially engaging. There’s a telling point in a comparison of caffeine vs. modafinil: _“modafinil improved energy but had no effects on cognitive performance… differences were very small”_ in well-rested individuals ([Ritalin, Provigil, and Caffeine Compared [60 Sec Psych] | 2020-12-02](https://www.thecarlatreport.com/blogs/2-the-carlat-psychiatry-podcast/post/3330-ritalin-provigil-and-caffeine-compared-60-sec-psych-#:~:text=Ritalin%2C%20Provigil%2C%20and%20Caffeine%20Compared,were%20very%20small%2C%20however)). This suggests that for everyday use, nootropics might not dramatically outshine a cup of coffee for most, and coffee’s broad benefits might outweigh the incremental gains of a nootropic for all but specific scenarios.

In summary, **nootropics** are like specialized tools that can outperform coffee in the **functional dimension** (especially for wakefulness duration and intensity) but are **inferior in emotional/social dimensions**. They serve as supplements or enhancements rather than full replacements for the holistic experience of coffee. A professional might take a nootropic for intense focus during a project, but still enjoy their morning coffee for the ritual and taste.

### Tea and Matcha

**Tea** is the natural alternative to coffee in many parts of the world – in fact, tea predates coffee as a daily stimulant in numerous cultures. Traditional black tea, green tea, oolong, etc., all contain caffeine (albeit usually less than coffee) and thus address similar functional needs. Meanwhile, **matcha**, a powdered green tea from Japan, has gained global popularity as a “coffee replacement” for the health-conscious, promising a smoother energy boost and rich antioxidants.

**Functional**: A typical cup of black tea has around 40–50 mg of caffeine, and green tea about 30 mg ([Caffeine Pills: A Coffee or Energy Drink Replacement?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-pills-7497810#:~:text=,30%20to%2050%20mg)), compared to ~95 mg in a cup of coffee. This means tea generally offers a milder _lift_. For many people, this is sufficient: tea can wake you up gently, sharpen your mind a bit, but with **less intensity**. For those who find coffee too strong or jittery, tea’s moderated caffeine is ideal. **Matcha**, because you consume the whole tea leaf powder, has higher caffeine than standard green tea – often ~70 mg per 8 oz serving. Importantly, matcha and other teas contain **L-theanine**, an amino acid that induces calm and modulates caffeine’s effect. As a result, the _energy from matcha is described as calm and sustained_. Studies and experts note that **matcha is less likely to cause jitters** because the theanine “helps balance out the stimulating nature of caffeine,” giving focused energy without anxiety ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=Coffee%20or%20Matcha%3A%20Which%20Is,Coffee%20is)) ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=Matcha%20is%20generally%20a%20better,without%20the%20risk%20of%20anxiousness)). In practice, someone might choose matcha when they want alertness _plus_ a measure of relaxation (e.g., a person with anxiety who avoids coffee might tolerate matcha well).

That said, if a person needs a **major caffeine hit**, traditional tea might not deliver. You can make it stronger (e.g., use multiple tea bags or brew chai which often has similar caffeine to coffee when concentrated), but generally coffee has the edge for raw potency. Some alternatives like **high-caffeine tea blends or “energy teas”** have emerged (combining tea with additional tea extracts or yerba mate to rival coffee’s caffeine content) ([ Matcha vs Coffee vs Energy Tea

```

**Emotional**: Tea excels in emotional goals. The act of brewing and sipping tea is inherently soothing for many. Each type of tea carries a distinct aroma and flavor profile, often associated with relaxation (think of the floral scent of jasmine tea or the ritual of English breakfast with milk). As one research on caffeine motives noted, “Taste” is a major factor – and tea can offer a pleasurable taste experience just like coffee ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=Mood%20factor%20includes%20items%20about,items%20that%20related%20to%20the) ). For those who dislike coffee’s bitterness, tea provides gentler options. **Matcha’s emotional appeal** is twofold: it’s seen as a _mindful, almost meditative drink_ (the traditional Japanese tea ceremony emphasizes a calm, focused preparation), and it also has a “vibrant green” aesthetic that people find novel and uplifting. Many health enthusiasts derive emotional satisfaction knowing matcha is loaded with antioxidants (e.g., one sample showed 137× more EGCG catechin than standard green tea ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=Matcha%20is%20gaining%20popularity%20in,and%20various%20health%20benefits%2C%20including))), making them feel they are doing something good for their body while getting energized.

Additionally, tea is often associated with **stress relief** – even though it has caffeine, the overall experience can be calming. In fact, a study on expectations of caffeine found categories like “social/mood enhancement” and even “anxiety/negative effects” where tea might score differently than coffee ( [Why Do You Drink Caffeine? The Development of the Motives for Caffeine Consumption Questionnaire (MCCQ) and Its Relationship with Gender, Age and the Types of Caffeinated Beverages - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6096549/#:~:text=match%20at%20L268%20negative%20effects%E2%80%99,enhancement%E2%80%99%2C%20%E2%80%98physical%20performance%20enhancement%E2%80%99%2C%20%E2%80%98anxiety%2Fnegative) ). People often believe (with some justification) that tea will boost mood and reduce tension, which is an emotional incentive to choose it over coffee if coffee sometimes makes them tense.

**Social**: Culturally, tea has at least as rich a social history as coffee. In places like the UK, having a cup of tea is a default social offering (“tea?” is as common as “hello” in some households). South Asia’s chai is central to social gatherings and hospitality. East Asia has formal tea ceremonies and casual tea houses for conversation. Tea’s social footprint is enormous – in fact, in sheer numbers, more people globally drink tea daily than coffee (driven by large populations in Asia and parts of Africa). So for _social goals_, tea is a **direct competitor to coffee**. People have tea parties, tea breaks, tea offered to guests – analogous to all the coffee situations.

One difference is **perception and segments**: In some trendy urban youth circles, coffee (especially from global chains like Starbucks) became seen as cool, whereas tea was considered old-fashioned. But this is changing with matcha and specialty tea shops rebranding tea as hip and premium. For example, matcha lattes and bubble tea have become very popular among younger demographics, creating new social trends around tea-based drinks. Also, tea is an inclusive option at social events – even coffee drinkers often enjoy tea later in the day or offer it as a caffeine-free alternative (herbal teas) to guests who avoid caffeine. So tea fosters social inclusion.

**Limitations**: Tea’s drawbacks relative to coffee revolve mostly around caffeine content and taste preferences. Hardcore coffee users might find tea too weak – functionally, they might not “feel” anything from a single cup of tea if they have a high caffeine tolerance. While matcha has more caffeine, one has to enjoy its unique grassy taste; otherwise it might not satisfy the craving that a bold coffee would. Some teas can cause minor issues: black tea’s tannins can cause nausea on empty stomach, as noted by health sources ([Coffee or Matcha: Which Is Better for Energy and Wellness?](https://www.verywellhealth.com/coffee-vs-matcha-11699930#:~:text=,tea%20on%20an%20empty%20stomach)). Tea can also stain teeth, similar to coffee. From a preparation standpoint, tea is easy to brew, though matcha requires whisking powder which is a bit more involved (though cafes now do this readily or offer premixed versions).

In summary, **tea (including matcha)** meets _functional needs_ in a milder, often more sustainable way, and often _exceeds coffee on emotional comfort_ (for those who prefer its gentler approach). Socially, tea has an equal footing in many cultures, making it a robust substitute. It might not fully satisfy someone looking for the **strongest kick**, but for many, tea’s holistic benefits make it a preferred alternative.

### Yerba Mate

**Yerba mate** is sometimes called the “South American coffee,” though it’s actually an herbal tea made from the leaves of the Ilex paraguariensis plant. Traditionally consumed in countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and parts of Brazil, mate has started to catch on elsewhere (with brands marketing it as an organic energy alternative). It occupies a unique spot: _higher caffeine than most teas, often approaching coffee-level stimulation, but with a very distinct cultural and social usage._

**Functional**: A typical serving of yerba mate (one gourdful) might have around 50–75 mg of caffeine, but the way mate is drunk – continuously refilling the gourd with hot water and sipping over an extended period – means a user can ingest **a lot of caffeine gradually**. Many mate drinkers report a sustained energy similar to coffee but without as much jitteriness or sudden crash. This could be due to mate’s mix of other compounds like theobromine (also found in chocolate) and theophylline, which have gentler stimulant effects. College students in Argentina, for example, might choose mate during study sessions as it keeps them energized and hydrated over hours. Athletes have also begun to use mate as a natural pre-workout drink for endurance. So functionally, mate **checks the same boxes as coffee**: increased alertness, reduced fatigue, better focus. One study on college students noted that energy drinks (often including yerba mate or guarana) were consumed with the expectation of “strong caffeine effects” for alertness and even perceived health benefits ([Motivations Influencing Caffeine Consumption Behaviors among College Students in Korea: Associations with Sleep Quality](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/4/953#:~:text=since%20tea%20brewed%20in%20a,blood%20circulation%2C%20which%20may%20help)) – this reflects how mate is sometimes viewed as a _strong but healthy_ stimulant.

**Emotional**: Yerba mate’s emotional appeal is deeply tied to tradition for those who grew up with it. The process of preparing mate – packing the herb into a gourd, pouring hot water, sipping through a metal straw – is ritualistic and can be very comforting. The taste is robust, herbal, and somewhat bitter (akin to a very strong green tea or tobacco-like flavor). It’s an acquired taste for new drinkers; those who love it find it invigorating and warming. Emotionally, mate can make one feel **connected to nature and heritage**, given its indigenous roots and natural preparation. It also tends to have **mood-lifting properties** for habitual users, likely due to the combination of stimulants and the social context in which it’s often consumed (with friends, which itself is mood-lifting). Health-conscious consumers outside South America often pick mate because it’s touted as **packed with vitamins, antioxidants, and amino acids** – this gives an emotional satisfaction of choosing a “clean” energy source compared to chemical-laden energy drinks.

**Social**: If coffee is a social drink in Western countries, mate is the **social drink par excellence** in parts of South America. The act of sharing a mate (one gourd passed person to person, each sipping in turn) is a symbol of friendship and trust. It is common for a group of friends or family to sit in a circle sharing mate and conversation for hours. This communal aspect is so central that not partaking can almost be seen as rude if you’re among mate drinkers (similar to refusing a coffee offered by a host, but even more intimate since sharing a straw is involved). In the workplace, people might take mate breaks similar to coffee breaks, although the ritual is a bit different. Because of these strong cultural ties, mate fulfills **social jobs of bonding, hospitality, and cultural identity** extremely well – but _primarily within those cultures_. Outside of South America, mate is still more of a curiosity, and the social rituals around it are not widely practiced. However, niche communities exist (e.g., circles of Argentine expats or health enthusiasts in the U.S. who have mate circles). Additionally, companies like Guayaki are marketing canned and bottled mate drinks (often flavored and sweetened) as a healthy energy drink alternative. These can be consumed socially like any bottled beverage, though they don’t carry the same communal ritual.

**Limitations**: Yerba mate’s barriers are mostly about adoption outside its home region. The flavor can be too bitter for some; often first-timers prefer it sweetened or mixed with other herbs. Traditional preparation is somewhat complex compared to just brewing tea or coffee – you need the equipment (gourd and _bombilla_ straw) and a thermos of hot water if on the go. There are tea-bag versions of mate and canned beverages to simplify this. Another consideration is health: there have been studies linking very hot mate consumption to esophageal cancer (likely due to the heat damaging the throat, rather than the herb itself), and some reports of mate (especially heavy, long-term use) having possible carcinogens from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in smoked dried mate leaves. These concerns are still being studied, but they can make some people hesitant. Caffeine-wise, mate can still cause insomnia or jitters if overdone, especially if someone is not used to it.

From a JTBD perspective, **yerba mate** is a strong contender for those who value both the _functional kick_ and a _sense of tradition/community_. A young professional in California might drink a canned mate for an afternoon energy boost believing it’s “healthier and more sustained” than coffee, thereby fulfilling the same functional job in a way that aligns with their emotional values (natural, sustainable). Meanwhile, an office worker in Buenos Aires might share mate with colleagues mid-morning for both the pick-me-up and the friendly social interaction, fulfilling functional, emotional, and social jobs all at once in a way coffee also would in that context.

Each of these substitute products – from high-tech nootropics to ancient tea rituals – finds a place in the landscape of caffeine and energy solutions. **Coffee’s broad capability** to meet functional, emotional, and social needs makes it hard to beat overall, which is why it remains the world’s go-to beverage for so many situations. But understanding these alternatives through the JTBD lens reveals why certain people or segments opt for one over the other. In essence, it comes down to **which “job” is prioritized**:

- When pure performance boost is king (pulling an all-nighter or needing maximal alertness), some might upgrade from coffee to a pill or energy drink (functional > emotional/social).
    
- When a gentler mood and health considerations matter (avoiding jitters, seeking antioxidants), tea or matcha might be hired (emotional/health > raw functional intensity).
    
- When strengthening social bonds or cultural expression is the main job (hosting friends, participating in tradition), any caffeinated drink that fits the culture – be it coffee, tea, or mate – will be chosen for its social resonance (social/emotional > functional, since even decaf or low-caf versions might suffice in those moments).
    

In a global context, we see coffee adapting and coexisting with these alternatives. Many consumers actually **mix and match**: a person might drink coffee at breakfast for a strong start, sip green tea in the afternoon for gentle sustain, and maybe use a caffeine tablet before a long drive at night. They “hire” different products for different jobs. For product developers and marketers, the JTBD approach highlights opportunities: for example, an energy drink brand might try to capture some of coffee’s social job by creating cafe-style lounges or a sugar-free, hot-serve version to mimic a coffeehouse feel. Conversely, coffee brands have noticed the appeal of things like matcha and are adding those to their menus to retain customers who occasionally want that emotional profile.

In conclusion, **coffee** endures because it performs a _triple role_ in consumers’ lives – functional stimulant, emotional comfort, and social facilitator – quite effectively. Its competitors each shine in one area or another but often at the expense of the holistic experience. Understanding these dynamics through Jobs-To-Be-Done not only explains current consumer behavior but can inform how new beverages or supplements position themselves in the future. Whatever the innovation, it will have to answer: _“What job will customers hire this drink to do, and how does that compare to the job coffee is doing for them today?”_
