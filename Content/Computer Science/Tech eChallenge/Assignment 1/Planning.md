## Initial Plan

**Prompt (Claude Sonnet 3.7 w/ Extended Thinking):** 

Hi, can you please review the following assignment specification and help me outline a clear, practical plan of attack?

- Break down each part into manageable steps. For example: begin by conducting research, answer specific research questions, build a structured outline based on this research, and then use this outline as a basis for my writing.
- The main goal is to provide a concise, straightforward plan. Include only tasks directly relevant to completing the assignment. Avoid unnecessary padding. Be comprehensive regarding the tasks I've specified, but keep the scope focused and practical.
- I will use ChatGPT's deep research as a starting point. Clearly structure the research phase of this outline to align with that process. In particular, include all possible questions or relevant topic areas that we should address through research.
- For now, focus specifically on tasks 1 and 2, especially regarding research.
- Do not include unnecessary formatting, emojis, or detailed explanations. I need a clear, practically focused outline that I can easily refer to and mark as complete. Tables are preferred.

*Assignment spec omitted for brevity*

Answer:

Here's a clear, practically focused outline structured into actionable steps with relevant questions you'll use to guide ChatGPT's deep research. Use this table to mark completion:

## Task 1.1: Research and Notes

**Prompt (ChatGPT 4.5 + Deep Research):** Hi, can you please me to conduct deep research into the JTBD framework? Here are the key questions you should aim to answer:

- What is the JTBD framework?
- Origin and foundational texts (key authors, seminal works).
- Core concepts: Job, "hiring" products, functional/emotional/social goals.
- How JTBD differs from demographic segmentation.
- Real-world examples from academic literature and credible industry case studies.
- How JTBD helps identify customer motivations and opportunities for innovation.
- Role of JTBD in shaping business strategy and influencing emerging technologies.
- Briefly mention limitations/critiques of JTBD.

Your goal is not to provide an articulate examination of these topics, but to find as much relevant information as you can, and present it back to me so that I can read, reflect, and reference in my own writing. 

**Answer:** [[Research Task 1]]

| I. Rethinking Customer Insights: The Motivational Shift | Recognizing the Gap in Traditional Segmentation: Set up the core problem: over-reliance on demographic/psychographic profiles that fail to capture why people buy; Introduce the idea that real insight comes from understanding the job a customer wants done. From “Who” to “Why”: Transition to the Jobs to Be Done concept: products are “hired” for specific customer goals; Very briefly note that JTBD emerged to address this motivational gap. (This introduction satisfies the assignment’s requirement to clarify why JTBD is important for understanding consumer behavior—without a long background. We simply frame the problem, then offer JTBD as the solution.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| II. The Theoretical Roots of JTBD                       | Seeds of the Concept: A nod to Theodore Levitt’s observation: people want the hole, not the drill; Show how that principle pointed marketers to outcomes instead of product attributes. Formal Pioneers: Briefly name Tony Ulwick (Outcome-Driven Innovation) and Clayton Christensen (Jobs Theory) as central to the framework’s formalization; Keep it succinct: only highlight the main reason they shaped JTBD, not a blow-by-blow history lesson. Essential Publications: Reference key works like Ulwick’s What Customers Want or Christensen’s Competing Against Luck to anchor this in credible literature. (This segment covers the requirement to “discuss its origins,” but flows out of the introduction naturally—showing how early insights became a formal framework.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| III. Core Principles: Defining “Jobs” in JTBD           | Jobs as the Unit of Analysis: Clarify what a “job” really is: the progress or outcome a customer seeks, independent of any specific solution; Emphasize functional, emotional, and social dimensions—how each dimension matters for true customer motivation. Why JTBD Transcends Demographics: Illustrate how focusing on the job clarifies why a product is “hired,” sidestepping demographic assumptions; Tie back to the big “aha!”: a 24-year-old and a 60-year-old can hire the same product for the same job. Identifying True Customer Needs: Show how JTBD reframes “needs” as criteria for successfully accomplishing the job (speed, convenience, status, emotional reassurance); Mention that understanding these outcome criteria directly shapes product requirements. (Here, we’re clearly meeting the requirement to define the framework and show how it “challenges the traditional demographic-based approach.”)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IV. Illustrating JTBD in Action                         | Milkshake Mornings: Summarize the fast-food milkshake case: commuters “hire” a thick shake to stay satisfied and entertained during a drive; Show how that insight reshaped product features (thickness, speed of service) and outperformed “demographic-based” assumptions. Intuit QuickBooks: Small business owners “just want their books done” rather than advanced accounting; Demonstrates how focusing on a job guides a simpler, targeted solution—and leads to success. Cordis Medical Devices: A quick note on how focusing on cardiologists’ actual procedure-related jobs led to multiple successful product lines; Underscores the power of discovering pain points and desired outcomes at a granular level. (The assignment demands “real-world examples.” Here they’re integrated in a single section that cements how the framework works in practice.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| V. How JTBD Fuels Product Innovation and Strategy       | Causal Insight → Innovative Solutions: Explain how JTBD reveals the cause behind purchases, guiding intentional innovation rather than guesswork; Connect to the point about identifying true customer needs and building features that tackle those needs head-on. Strategic Positioning and Market Definition: Instead of labeling markets by product categories (“the camera market”), define them by the job (“helping people capture memories”); Show how that perspective helps companies identify adjacent innovation opportunities and avoid disruption. Future Impact on Emerging Technologies: Briefly discuss how AI, IoT, or new digital solutions can address existing jobs even better, or reveal entirely new jobs; Suggest that forward-thinking firms align technology investments with clear job outcomes. (This section answers the requirement to “explain how the framework helps businesses identify true customer needs and how this perspective is applied in product innovation,” and “discuss the role of JTBD in shaping business strategies and its potential future impact on emerging technologies.”) |
| VI. Concluding Remarks                                  | Synthesis: Recap how moving from demographic-based thinking to a job-centric mindset can transform consumer insight, product development, and long-term strategy; Re-emphasize that JTBD reveals why people buy, not just who they are. Academic and Professional Engagement: Remind the reader that proper referencing (academic journals, HBR articles, industry case studies) is critical to validate arguments; Encourage further reading of seminal works (Christensen, Ulwick) for deeper context. (The assignment specifically wants a reminder about referencing, so we close by emphasizing it.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Final Notes on Flow                                     | Start by challenging conventional segmentation and setting up why we need a new framework; Move into where JTBD came from historically, but only in service to clarifying its modern relevance; Outline the fundamentals of the framework, showing how it redefines needs and solves real problems; Provide examples to ground the theory in reality; Connect it all to product innovation, strategy, and future directions—highlighting the framework’s practical power; Close with key takeaways and stress the importance of citations and deeper research. This structure avoids the rigid bullet-by-bullet sequence from either the spec or the research. Instead, it blends all must-cover topics into a naturally flowing narrative, from the problem (misguided segmentation) → solution (JTBD) → proof (examples) → broader strategic application → final wrap-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
## Task 1.3: Initial Draft

Despite collecting vast amounts of customer data, companies often struggle with innovation success. The culprit? An over-reliance on demographic research that reveals *who* buys products but fails to uncover *why* purchases occur. Clayton Christensen, renowned innovation expert and author of "Competing Against Luck," observed that companies "know more about their customers than ever, yet innovation success remains hit-or-miss" because they focus on correlations in data instead of the causal mechanism behind purchases (Christensen et al., 2016).

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework addresses this gap by shifting focus from customer attributes to customer objectives. Rather than asking "What kind of person would buy this product?" JTBD asks "What job is the customer trying to accomplish?" This perspective recognises that customers essentially "hire" products and services to help them make progress or solve problems in specific situations (HBS Online, 2020). When a product performs this job well, customers rehire it; when it performs poorly, they "fire" it and look for alternatives (Christensen et al., 2016).

The JTBD framework can be traced back to Harvard professor Theodore Levitt's famous observation: "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!" (Strategyn, n.d.). This insight shifted focus from products to outcomes, laying groundwork for future innovation thinking. Two pioneers formalised this concept into today's framework: Tony Ulwick, who applied jobs-focused approaches at Cordis Corporation in the early 1990s and published the first JTBD book "What Customers Want" (2005); and Clayton Christensen, whose "Marketing Malpractice" (2005) article and subsequent book "Competing Against Luck" (2016) established Jobs Theory as a cornerstone of innovation thinking (Ulwick, 2020). Their work transformed a simple insight into a powerful framework that consistently uncovers why customers make purchase decisions.

In JTBD, a "job" is defined as "a statement that describes, with precision, what people are trying to accomplish in a given situation" (Ulwick, 2020). Each job encompasses three critical dimensions:

- **Functional** (the practical objectives that need to be accomplished - what literally needs to get done)
- **Emotional** (how customers want to feel or avoid feeling during the process, such as confidence, satisfaction, or avoiding frustration)
- **Social** (how customers want to be perceived by others, including considerations of status, identity, and competence) 

Christensen emphasises that understanding all three dimensions is essential for developing solutions that address the complete job (HBS Working Knowledge, 2006).

JTBD transcends traditional demographic segmentation by focusing on why products are hired regardless of who does the hiring. Consider how a 24-year-old urban professional with limited cooking skills and a 60-year-old suburban retiree with mobility challenges might both hire the same meal delivery service. Despite their demographic differences, they share the job of "having a convenient, high-quality meal without the burden of shopping, preparation, and cleanup." This explains why demographic profiles often fail to predict purchasing behavior—the causal mechanism is the job, not customer attributes.

The framework reframes customer "needs" as specific success criteria for accomplishing jobs. These precise outcome statements (e.g., "minimize preparation time" rather than "convenience") provide clear targets for product development, making innovation more predictable and directly informing product requirements.
