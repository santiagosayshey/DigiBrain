Prompt: Hello, can you please take a look at this assignment spec and help me to outline a plan of attack? Can we:
- Break down each parts into manageable steps. For example, we would want to conduct research first, answer a few specific questions with this research, then build a basic outline / structure, then allow me to write out that section using the research
- The key job here is to outline a no non sense plan. This means adding tasks only relevant to the job at hand, theres no need to pad here for the sake of being 'comprehensive'. You should still be comprehensive in the tasks i've asked you to do, just don't go over-bored. 
- I will be using chatGPT's deep research as a starting point for my research, so please be sure to structure the research part of this outline in accordance with that. Particularly, make suire you include all possible questions we might want to asnwer / relevant topic points.
