## Initial Plan

**Prompt (Claude Sonnet 3.7 w/ Extended Thinking):** 

Hi, can you please review the following assignment specification and help me outline a clear, practical plan of attack?

- Break down each part into manageable steps. For example: begin by conducting research, answer specific research questions, build a structured outline based on this research, and then use this outline as a basis for my writing.
- The main goal is to provide a concise, straightforward plan. Include only tasks directly relevant to completing the assignment. Avoid unnecessary padding. Be comprehensive regarding the tasks I've specified, but keep the scope focused and practical.
- I will use ChatGPT's deep research as a starting point. Clearly structure the research phase of this outline to align with that process. In particular, include all possible questions or relevant topic areas that we should address through research.
- For now, focus specifically on tasks 1 and 2, especially regarding research.
- Do not include unnecessary formatting, emojis, or detailed explanations. I need a clear, practically focused outline that I can easily refer to and mark as complete. Tables are preferred.

*Assignment spec omitted for brevity*

Answer:

Here's a clear, practically focused outline structured into actionable steps with relevant questions you'll use to guide ChatGPT's deep research. Use this table to mark completion:

## Task 1.1: Research and Notes

**Prompt (ChatGPT 4.5 + Deep Research):** Hi, can you please me to conduct deep research into the JTBD framework? Here are the key questions you should aim to answer:

- What is the JTBD framework?
- Origin and foundational texts (key authors, seminal works).
- Core concepts: Job, "hiring" products, functional/emotional/social goals.
- How JTBD differs from demographic segmentation.
- Real-world examples from academic literature and credible industry case studies.
- How JTBD helps identify customer motivations and opportunities for innovation.
- Role of JTBD in shaping business strategy and influencing emerging technologies.
- Briefly mention limitations/critiques of JTBD.

Your goal is not to provide an articulate examination of these topics, but to find as much relevant information as you can, and present it back to me so that I can read, reflect, and reference in my own writing. 

**Answer:** [[Research Task 1]]

## Task 1.2: Structured Outline

|Brief History/Origins|• Theodore Levitt's insight: Customers buy outcomes, not products ("quarter-inch hole")<br>• Shift from product-centric to job-centric perspectives<br>• Tony Ulwick: Early 1990s applications at Cordis Corporation, Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) methodology (Harvard Business Review, 2002), Seminal book "What Customers Want" (2005)<br>• Clayton Christensen: Influential 2005 HBR article "Marketing Malpractice", Expanded JTBD through "Competing Against Luck" (2016), Emphasized causal understanding of customer choices<br>• Key Figures: Tony Ulwick, Clayton Christensen, Bob Moesta<br>• Methodological differences: ODI vs. qualitative job stories approach|
|Comparison with Traditional Segmentation Approaches|• Traditional segmentation limitations: superficial attributes, correlations not causations<br>• JTBD approach: situational contexts, progress sought, constraints faced by customers<br>• Milkshake Example (Christensen): Traditional segmentation failed (flavors, pricing), JTBD revealed morning commuters' job: "entertainment and satiety during commute", Resulted in actionable innovation (thicker shakes, faster service)<br>• Markets defined by jobs rather than product categories<br>• Competition includes all possible solutions, not just similar products|
|Significance for Consumer Insights and Innovation|• Uncovers hidden needs through causal inquiry<br>• Identifies latent struggles and unmet needs<br>• Reveals opportunity gaps and non-consumption areas<br>• Drives product/service innovation tightly aligned with real customer needs<br>• Reduces innovation risk by focusing on causality rather than correlation|
|Examples from Literature or Industry Cases|• Milkshake for Breakfast: Identified specific commuter needs and constraints, Innovated product attributes (thickness, faster transactions)<br>• Intuit QuickBooks: Discovered small-business job: "just get my books done", Simple, targeted solution (fewer features, ease-of-use), capturing significant market share<br>• Cordis Corporation: Uncovered unmet cardiologist needs, developed specialized angioplasty balloons, Dramatic market success, from 1% to 20% market share<br>• Kimberly-Clark Depends: Identified emotional/social job related to dignity in adult incontinence, Designed discreet, underwear-like products, enhancing emotional acceptance|
|Impact on Business Strategy and Future Implications|• "Job as North Star": aligns teams around job outcomes<br>• Real-world success: Cox Automotive achieved 20x user growth via job-focused roadmap<br>• Redefines market boundaries around jobs<br>• Allows adaptive strategy in changing technology landscapes (Nike, SNHU cases)<br>• End-to-end journey alignment with jobs<br>• Marketing messages resonate by highlighting job-related outcomes (Moen faucets, OnStar)<br>• Integration with emerging technologies (AI, IoT) to better serve jobs<br>• Continuous evolution and refinement of jobs as societal and technological contexts evolve<br>• Ongoing relevance as markets increasingly prioritize customer-centric innovation|
## Task 1.3: Initial Draft

**Definition and Context:**  
Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a knowledge framework that aims to understand the underlying goals customers want to accomplish when they 'hire' a product or service. Instead of pigeonholing customers into misleading demographic categories like age, income, or location, JTBD examines why customers make purchases—focusing on the specific "job" they need done.

In JTBD, a "job" is precisely defined as the fundamental problem, task, or goal that a customer seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance. It is solution-agnostic, meaning it does not depend on any particular product or service. People will pursue these jobs using whatever solution is available or convenient, including products, services, or even DIY solutions.

The JTBD framework uses a metaphor of customers "hiring" products or services to perform specific jobs. When a customer faces a job to be done, they "hire" a product much like hiring an employee. If the product effectively fulfils the job, it continues to be "hired"; if not, it gets "fired" in favor of another solution.

The framework provides a methodology for uncovering the actual circumstances driving customer decisions, which can be understood through three key dimensions:

1. **Functional:** The practical aspects of what customers are trying to accomplish, including objective tasks, problems to solve, or improvements to existing solutions.
2. **Emotional:** The feelings and sentiments customers want to experience or avoid. Products often serve to make customers feel confident, secure, accomplished, or relieved from anxiety.
3. **Social:** How customers want to be perceived by others when using the product or service. This includes effects on social status, reinforcement of group membership, personal identity expression, and shaping how others perceive the user.

**Brief History and Origins:**
"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!" This observation by Harvard professor Theodore Levitt captures the fundamental insight that would eventually evolve into the JTBD framework. Rather than focusing on product features or customer demographics, JTBD examines the underlying motivations driving purchases. A drill isn't bought for its own sake - it's bought to create holes for hanging pictures or installing shelves.

The modern JTBD theory developed along two parallel paths in the 1990s and early 2000s. Tony Ulwick pioneered the Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) approach while working at Cordis Corporation from 1991-1993. His methodology helped the company dramatically increase its market share in angioplasty balloons from 1% to over 20% by focusing on addressing unmet needs of cardiologists. Ulwick formalized these ideas in his seminal 2002 Harvard Business Review article "Turn Customer Input into Innovation" and his 2005 book "What Customers Want."

Simultaneously, Clayton Christensen, Bob Moesta and Taddy Hall, were developing their own Jobs Theory framework. Christensen's 2005 article "Marketing Malpractice: The Cause and the Cure" argued that companies should focus on understanding the fundamental job customers need done rather than demographic segments. This approach was further developed in the 2016 book "Competing Against Luck," which presented a comprehensive theory of customer choice centred around jobs to be done.

While both schools share the core premise that understanding customer jobs brings predictability to innovation, they differ in methodology. Ulwick's ODI approach emphasizes identifying and quantifying desired outcomes, while Christensen and Moesta's method focuses on in-depth customer interviews to uncover job "stories." Together, these complementary approaches have revolutionized how businesses think about innovation and customer needs.
