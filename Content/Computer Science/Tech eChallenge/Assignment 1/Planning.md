## Initial Plan

**Prompt (Claude Sonnet 3.7 w/ Extended Thinking):** 

Hi, can you please review the following assignment specification and help me outline a clear, practical plan of attack?

- Break down each part into manageable steps. For example: begin by conducting research, answer specific research questions, build a structured outline based on this research, and then use this outline as a basis for my writing.
- The main goal is to provide a concise, straightforward plan. Include only tasks directly relevant to completing the assignment. Avoid unnecessary padding. Be comprehensive regarding the tasks I've specified, but keep the scope focused and practical.
- I will use ChatGPT's deep research as a starting point. Clearly structure the research phase of this outline to align with that process. In particular, include all possible questions or relevant topic areas that we should address through research.
- For now, focus specifically on tasks 1 and 2, especially regarding research.
- Do not include unnecessary formatting, emojis, or detailed explanations. I need a clear, practically focused outline that I can easily refer to and mark as complete. Tables are preferred.

*Assignment spec omitted for brevity*

Answer:

Here's a clear, practically focused outline structured into actionable steps with relevant questions you'll use to guide ChatGPT's deep research. Use this table to mark completion:

## Task 1.1: Research and Notes

**Prompt (ChatGPT 4.5 + Deep Research):** 

Hi, can you please me to conduct deep research into the JTBD framework? Here are the key questions you should aim to answer:

- What is the JTBD framework?
- Origin and foundational texts (key authors, seminal works).
- Core concepts: Job, "hiring" products, functional/emotional/social goals.
- How JTBD differs from demographic segmentation.
- Real-world examples from academic literature and credible industry case studies.
- How JTBD helps identify customer motivations and opportunities for innovation.
- Role of JTBD in shaping business strategy and influencing emerging technologies.
- Briefly mention limitations/critiques of JTBD.

Your goal is not to provide an articulate examination of these topics, but to find as much relevant information as you can, and present it back to me so that I can read, reflect, and reference in my own writing. 

**Answer:** [[Research Task 1]]

| I. Rethinking Customer Insights: The Motivational Shift | Recognizing the Gap in Traditional Segmentation: Set up the core problem: over-reliance on demographic/psychographic profiles that fail to capture why people buy; Introduce the idea that real insight comes from understanding the job a customer wants done. From “Who” to “Why”: Transition to the Jobs to Be Done concept: products are “hired” for specific customer goals; Very briefly note that JTBD emerged to address this motivational gap. (This introduction satisfies the assignment’s requirement to clarify why JTBD is important for understanding consumer behavior—without a long background. We simply frame the problem, then offer JTBD as the solution.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| II. The Theoretical Roots of JTBD                       | Seeds of the Concept: A nod to Theodore Levitt’s observation: people want the hole, not the drill; Show how that principle pointed marketers to outcomes instead of product attributes. Formal Pioneers: Briefly name Tony Ulwick (Outcome-Driven Innovation) and Clayton Christensen (Jobs Theory) as central to the framework’s formalization; Keep it succinct: only highlight the main reason they shaped JTBD, not a blow-by-blow history lesson. Essential Publications: Reference key works like Ulwick’s What Customers Want or Christensen’s Competing Against Luck to anchor this in credible literature. (This segment covers the requirement to “discuss its origins,” but flows out of the introduction naturally—showing how early insights became a formal framework.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| III. Core Principles: Defining “Jobs” in JTBD           | Jobs as the Unit of Analysis: Clarify what a “job” really is: the progress or outcome a customer seeks, independent of any specific solution; Emphasize functional, emotional, and social dimensions—how each dimension matters for true customer motivation. Why JTBD Transcends Demographics: Illustrate how focusing on the job clarifies why a product is “hired,” sidestepping demographic assumptions; Tie back to the big “aha!”: a 24-year-old and a 60-year-old can hire the same product for the same job. Identifying True Customer Needs: Show how JTBD reframes “needs” as criteria for successfully accomplishing the job (speed, convenience, status, emotional reassurance); Mention that understanding these outcome criteria directly shapes product requirements. (Here, we’re clearly meeting the requirement to define the framework and show how it “challenges the traditional demographic-based approach.”)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IV. Illustrating JTBD in Action                         | Milkshake Mornings: Summarize the fast-food milkshake case: commuters “hire” a thick shake to stay satisfied and entertained during a drive; Show how that insight reshaped product features (thickness, speed of service) and outperformed “demographic-based” assumptions. Intuit QuickBooks: Small business owners “just want their books done” rather than advanced accounting; Demonstrates how focusing on a job guides a simpler, targeted solution—and leads to success. Cordis Medical Devices: A quick note on how focusing on cardiologists’ actual procedure-related jobs led to multiple successful product lines; Underscores the power of discovering pain points and desired outcomes at a granular level. (The assignment demands “real-world examples.” Here they’re integrated in a single section that cements how the framework works in practice.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| V. How JTBD Fuels Product Innovation and Strategy       | Causal Insight → Innovative Solutions: Explain how JTBD reveals the cause behind purchases, guiding intentional innovation rather than guesswork; Connect to the point about identifying true customer needs and building features that tackle those needs head-on. Strategic Positioning and Market Definition: Instead of labeling markets by product categories (“the camera market”), define them by the job (“helping people capture memories”); Show how that perspective helps companies identify adjacent innovation opportunities and avoid disruption. Future Impact on Emerging Technologies: Briefly discuss how AI, IoT, or new digital solutions can address existing jobs even better, or reveal entirely new jobs; Suggest that forward-thinking firms align technology investments with clear job outcomes. (This section answers the requirement to “explain how the framework helps businesses identify true customer needs and how this perspective is applied in product innovation,” and “discuss the role of JTBD in shaping business strategies and its potential future impact on emerging technologies.”) |
| VI. Concluding Remarks                                  | Synthesis: Recap how moving from demographic-based thinking to a job-centric mindset can transform consumer insight, product development, and long-term strategy; Re-emphasize that JTBD reveals why people buy, not just who they are. Academic and Professional Engagement: Remind the reader that proper referencing (academic journals, HBR articles, industry case studies) is critical to validate arguments; Encourage further reading of seminal works (Christensen, Ulwick) for deeper context. (The assignment specifically wants a reminder about referencing, so we close by emphasizing it.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Final Notes on Flow                                     | Start by challenging conventional segmentation and setting up why we need a new framework; Move into where JTBD came from historically, but only in service to clarifying its modern relevance; Outline the fundamentals of the framework, showing how it redefines needs and solves real problems; Provide examples to ground the theory in reality; Connect it all to product innovation, strategy, and future directions—highlighting the framework’s practical power; Close with key takeaways and stress the importance of citations and deeper research. This structure avoids the rigid bullet-by-bullet sequence from either the spec or the research. Instead, it blends all must-cover topics into a naturally flowing narrative, from the problem (misguided segmentation) → solution (JTBD) → proof (examples) → broader strategic application → final wrap-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
## Task 1.3: Initial Draft

**Introduction**
Despite collecting vast amounts of customer data, companies often struggle with product innovation. The culprit? An over-reliance on demographic research that reveals *who* buys products but fails to uncover *why* purchases occur. Clayton Christensen, innovation expert and author of "Competing Against Luck," observed that companies "know more about their customers than ever, yet innovation success remains hit-or-miss" because they focus on correlations in data instead of the causal mechanism behind purchases (Christensen et al., 2016).

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework addresses this gap by shifting focus from customer attributes to customer objectives. Rather than asking "What kind of person would buy this product?" JTBD asks "What job is the customer trying to accomplish?" This perspective recognises that customers essentially "hire" products and services to help them make progress or solve problems in specific situations (HBS Online, 2020). When a product performs this job well, customers rehire it; when it performs poorly, they "fire" it and look for alternatives (Christensen et al., 2016).

**History**
The JTBD framework can be traced back to Harvard professor Theodore Levitt's famous observation: "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!" (Strategyn, n.d.). This insight shifted focus from products to outcomes, laying groundwork for future innovation thinking. Two pioneers formalised this concept into today's framework: Tony Ulwick, who applied jobs-focused approaches at Cordis Corporation in the early 1990s and published the first JTBD book "What Customers Want" (2005); and Clayton Christensen, whose "Marketing Malpractice" (2005) article and subsequent book "Competing Against Luck" (2016) established Jobs Theory as a cornerstone of innovation thinking (Ulwick, 2020). Their work transformed a simple insight into a powerful framework that consistently uncovers why customers make purchase decisions.

**Defining JTBD**
In JTBD, a "job" is defined as "a statement that describes, with precision, what people are trying to accomplish in a given situation" (Ulwick, 2020). Each job encompasses three critical dimensions:

- **Functional** (the practical objectives that need to be accomplished - what literally needs to get done)
- **Emotional** (how customers want to feel or avoid feeling during the process, such as confidence, satisfaction, or avoiding frustration)
- **Social** (how customers want to be perceived by others, including considerations of status, identity, and competence)

Understanding these three dimensions allows companies to see beyond surface-level customer attributes and focus on underlying motivations. This is why JTBD moves past traditional demographic segmentation - it identifies why products are hired regardless of who does the hiring.

For example, a 24-year-old marketing associate working long hours and a 60-year-old retiree with mobility challenges might both hire the same meal delivery service. Despite their demographic differences, they share the job of "having a convenient, high-quality meal without the burden of shopping, preparation, and cleanup." Demographic profiles fail to predict this purchasing behaviour because the causal mechanism is the job itself, not customer attributes.

**Real World Examples**
This principle has proven powerful when applied in business settings. Christensen's famous "milkshake morning" case study illustrates how identifying the true job transforms product development. A fast-food chain discovered that many customers purchased milkshakes early in the morning, consuming them alone during their commutes. These customers weren't hiring the milkshake for taste or nutrition, but to make a long, boring drive more bearable while staying full until lunch. The thick, viscous texture allowed it to last throughout the commute and was easier to consume while driving than alternatives like bagels (too crumbly) or bananas (consumed too quickly). Once the company understood this job, they focused on making shakes thicker and speeding up the purchase process; improvements that directly addressed the job requirements rather than demographic preferences (HBS Working Knowledge, 2006).

Similarly, Intuit's QuickBooks emerged from recognising that small-business owners didn't want to become accountants; they simply wanted their "books done" with minimal effort. This insight led Intuit to develop a product with deliberately less functionality than competitors but in a simpler package that better accomplished the core job. QuickBooks quickly captured the majority of its market because it addressed what customers truly needed rather than offering feature parity with competitors (Strategy+Business, 2016).

**Future Innovation**
The success stories of the milkshake and QuickBooks demonstrate how understanding jobs transforms existing products, but JTBD's greater value lies in guiding future innovation and strategy. When companies define their markets by the jobs customers need done rather than by product categories, they gain a huge advantage. Instead of seeing themselves as "milkshake makers" or "software developers," they recognise their true role in fulfilling fundamental customer needs that remain stable even as technologies evolve. This perspective helps businesses identify adjacent innovation opportunities; a photography company might expand from cameras to cloud storage solutions once they define their market as "preserving memories" rather than "selling cameras." As emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and automation continue advancing, JTBD provides a framework for evaluating their potential: not by asking "How can we use this new technology?" but rather "Which customer jobs could this technology help accomplish more effectively?" This approach ensures innovation efforts remain grounded in actual customer needs rather than chasing technological trends, leading to higher success rates for new products and services while protecting against disruption from unexpected competitors (Strategy+Business, 2016).

**Conclusion**
The Jobs to Be Done framework transforms how businesses understand customer behaviour by focusing on the causal drivers behind purchases rather than demographic correlations. Moving from "who buys" to "why they buy" provides clarity that demographic data alone cannot deliver, enabling more precise product development and strategic positioning. When companies align their innovations with the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of customer jobs, they create solutions that resonate regardless of demographic boundaries.

## Task 2.4: Initial Draft


**Introduction** 
Coffee stands as one of the most widely consumed beverages, with a market valued at approximately $100 billion (Coffee Market Size, 2024). Coffee's universal appeal makes it an ideal candidate for Jobs-to-Be-Done analysis, revealing why consumers "hire" coffee.

**Jobs and Goals:**
Coffee fulfils multiple customer needs that can be categorised across functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

| **Goal Type**        | **Key Examples**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Goals** | • Increasing alertness and focus during work or study<br>• Boosting physical energy to combat fatigue<br>• Enhancing concentration for extended periods<br>• Managing caffeine withdrawal symptoms<br>• Improving athletic performance during workouts           |
| **Emotional Goals**  | • Creating comfort through warmth and familiar aroma<br>• Establishing a calming ritual and sense of normalcy<br>• Offering a mood enhancement and mental uplift<br>• Providing sensory pleasure through taste<br>• Creating moments of indulgence and self-care |

| **I. Introduction to the Product Concept**    | • **Brief Recap of the Problem**: Summarize the pain points researchers, students, and authors face (time-consuming, mentally draining article reading).<br>• **High-Level Solution**: Highlight how Synapsis uses AI/LLMs to convert dense research content into concise, engaging video summaries.<br>• **Transition to JTBD**: Mention that we'll map Synapsis's features to the jobs researchers need done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **II. Defining Jobs and Goals**               | **Functional Goals**: Outline the tasks or practical objectives the product fulfills (e.g., convenience, speed, performance).<br><br>**Emotional Goals**: Describe how it makes customers feel—comfort, excitement, relief, etc.<br><br>**Social Goals**: Show how it influences the user's image or social standing (e.g., status, belonging).<br><br>**Situation → Motivation → Outcome**: Use the JTBD Story Canvas ("When... I want to... So I can...") to define the job. Highlight the typical use scenario and user objectives.<br><br>**Link to Core Customer Need**: Emphasise the central pain point or opportunity the product addresses, distinguishing it from purely demographic considerations.<br><br>**Job Statement Canvas:** Organise jobs into rows. First column is the job itself identified using the story canvas. Then each subsequent column is the function, emotional and social goals. |
| **III. Feature Alignment & Design Rationale** | • **Video Summaries & Narration**: Justify this format by explaining how visuals + concise language cater to the functional job of quick comprehension and the emotional goal of reducing cognitive load.<br>• **Dynamic Graphics**: Tie to the job of retaining information (enhanced recall through visual engagement).<br>• **Customizable Length/Depth**: Address the need to skim vs. deep dive, giving users emotional relief (knowing they won't miss key insights).<br>• **Topic Detection Across Fields**: Show how broad coverage supports multi-disciplinary researchers; ties directly to the functional job of easily exploring new areas.<br>(these are just some I've added for example, please review the implementation and concept documents for a full understanding)                                                                                                                            |
| **VI. Conclusion & Future Possibilities**     | • **Recap of JTBD Fit**: Reiterate how each feature (video summaries, clear language, visuals) responds to the two main jobs identified.<br>• **Potential Iterations**: Mention additional expansions (e.g., interactive quizzes for further engagement).<br>• **Final Thought**: Emphasize that Synapsis addresses the core functional and emotional drivers behind reading academic papers, thereby accelerating knowledge consumption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
## Task 3.2 Initial Draft

**Introduction**

In today's information-rich world, individuals across all sectors struggle with the overwhelming volume of complex, technical content they must process daily. This challenge is particularly relevant for researchers, students, and authors who face dense, jargon-heavy academic literature that demands significant time and mental energy to comprehend effectively.

AI offers an elegant solution by transforming how we interact with complex information. Synapsis leverages this technology to convert dense technical content into engaging video summaries with clear language and dynamic visuals, making knowledge consumption faster and more effective.

As we explore Synapsis further, we will map its innovative features directly to the jobs researchers need done, demonstrating how our solution addresses both functional requirements and emotional needs in the knowledge consumption process.
