Prompt: Hello, can you please take a look at this assignment spec and help me to outline a plan of attack? Can we:
- Break down each parts into manageable steps. For example, we would want to conduct research first, answer a few specific questions with this research, then build a basic outline / structure, then allow me to write out that section using the research
- The key job here is to outline a no non sense plan. This means adding tasks only relevant to the job at hand, theres no need to pad here for the sake of being 'comprehensive'. You should still be comprehensive in the tasks i've asked you to do, just don't go over-bored. 
- I will be using chatGPT's deep research as a starting point for my research, so please be sure to structure the research part of this outline in accordance with that. Particularly, make suire you include all possible questions we might want to asnwer / relevant topic points. 
- We should be focusing on task 1 and 2 for now (especially in terms of research)
- Please do not bother with nicely formatting with emojis and dotpoints and explanatory language. I want a clear, practically focused outline i can refer back to, and easily mark as complete. Tables are you friend. 

This is the assignment specification:

**Formatting & Submission Requirements**

- Word Limit: 2000 words (+/- 10%)
- File Format: Cadmus only - NO PDF or Word document
- Submission Platform: MyUni CADMUS

**Task Overview**

This assessment requires you to engage with the **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework**, a concept introduced by Clayton Christensen et al. that explains why customers "hire" products to complete specific jobs. The framework enables a customer-centred approach to technology innovation and product development.

Your task is to write a 2000-word **Jobs To be Done Contextual Analysis** (+/-10%) that:

- Explains the JTBD framework using appropriate academic references.
- Applies the framework to a real-world product example.
- Uses the JTBD framework to analyse and justify the design of your own product idea.

**Jobs To be Done Contextual Analysis Structure**

Your analysis must include the following three parts:

**_Part 1: Understanding the JTBD Framework_**

In this section, you will introduce and explain the Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework. This includes defining the framework, discussing its origins, and highlighting its significance in understanding consumer behaviour and product development. Your discussion should reference key academic sources and industry literature to establish a well-researched understanding of JTBD.

JTBD challenges the traditional demographic-based approach to market segmentation by focusing on the underlying motivation behind why a customer “hires” a product or service. You should explain how the framework helps businesses identify true customer needs and how this perspective is applied in product innovation. Additionally, discuss the role of JTBD in shaping business strategies and its potential future impact on emerging technologies.

Use real-world examples from academic literature or industry case studies to demonstrate your understanding of the framework in action. This section should also emphasise proper referencing, showing your engagement with credible academic and professional sources.

**Part 2: Applying JTBD to a Real-World Example**

For this section, you will apply the JTBD framework to a real-world product example. You must select **one** of the provided examples:

Once you have chosen your example, analyse the product by identifying the job it was designed to fulfil. Consider the following aspects:

•    Functional Goals: What specific task is the product helping the customer complete?  
•    Emotional Goals: How does using this product make the customer feel?  
•    Social Goals: How does the product influence how others perceive the customer?

To structure your analysis, use Figure 1: JTBD Story Canvas. This framework will help you break down the situation (When ____), the motivation (I want to ____), and the expected outcome (So I can ____). Your analysis should demonstrate an understanding of how customer needs and desires drive product adoption.

_Figure 1. JTBD Story canvas. Situation, Motivation, Expected Outcome._

Support your analysis with external research, referencing similar products and their market positioning. Consider what features were designed to meet specific customer goals and discuss any limitations in the product’s ability to fulfil its intended job.

**Part 3: Using JTBD to Develop Your Own Product**

In this section, you will apply the JTBD framework to the design of your own technology product. You should:

1. Identify at least two key jobs your product is designed to help customers accomplish.
2. Anticipate the functional and emotional requirements of your target customer.
3. Justify your design decisions using the JTBD framework.

To help guide your analysis, refer to Figure 2: Job Statement Canvas, which breaks down the key aspects of a customer’s job into functional, personal (emotional), and social goals. The table should assist you in clearly outlining the user’s motivation, the problem they are trying to solve, and how your product aligns with these needs.

Be specific in your design rationale. For example, if you are developing a fitness app, you should explain how the app’s features (such as real-time workout tracking, personalised plans, or social sharing) align with the JTBD principles. Similarly, if you are designing an ergonomic chair, discuss how factors like comfort, posture support, and aesthetic appeal address the different levels of customer needs.
