## Initial Plan

**Prompt (Claude Sonnet 3.7 w/ Extended Thinking):** 

Hi, can you please review the following assignment specification and help me outline a clear, practical plan of attack?

- Break down each part into manageable steps. For example: begin by conducting research, answer specific research questions, build a structured outline based on this research, and then use this outline as a basis for my writing.
- The main goal is to provide a concise, straightforward plan. Include only tasks directly relevant to completing the assignment. Avoid unnecessary padding. Be comprehensive regarding the tasks I've specified, but keep the scope focused and practical.
- I will use ChatGPT's deep research as a starting point. Clearly structure the research phase of this outline to align with that process. In particular, include all possible questions or relevant topic areas that we should address through research.
- For now, focus specifically on tasks 1 and 2, especially regarding research.
- Do not include unnecessary formatting, emojis, or detailed explanations. I need a clear, practically focused outline that I can easily refer to and mark as complete. Tables are preferred.

*Assignment spec omitted for brevity*

Answer:

Here's a clear, practically focused outline structured into actionable steps with relevant questions you'll use to guide ChatGPT's deep research. Use this table to mark completion:

## Task 1.1: Research and Notes

**Prompt (ChatGPT 4.5 + Deep Research):** Hi, can you please me to conduct deep research into the JTBD framework? Here are the key questions you should aim to answer:

- What is the JTBD framework?
- Origin and foundational texts (key authors, seminal works).
- Core concepts: Job, "hiring" products, functional/emotional/social goals.
- How JTBD differs from demographic segmentation.
- Real-world examples from academic literature and credible industry case studies.
- How JTBD helps identify customer motivations and opportunities for innovation.
- Role of JTBD in shaping business strategy and influencing emerging technologies.
- Briefly mention limitations/critiques of JTBD.

Your goal is not to provide an articulate examination of these topics, but to find as much relevant information as you can, and present it back to me so that I can read, reflect, and reference in my own writing. 

**Answer:** [[Research Task 1]]

## Task 1.2: Structured Outline

|Topic|Key Points|
|---|---|
|Definition and Context|• Innovation framework focusing on jobs or goals customers want to achieve<br>• Customers "hire" products/services to accomplish specific tasks or solve problems<br>• Emphasizes causal reasons behind consumer purchases rather than demographics<br>• Job as the fundamental unit of analysis<br>• "Hiring and firing" metaphor: success of solutions determined by job performance<br>• Dimensions: functional (practical tasks), emotional (feelings), social (perceptions by others)|
|Brief History/Origins|• Theodore Levitt's insight: Customers buy outcomes, not products ("quarter-inch hole")<br>• Shift from product-centric to job-centric perspectives<br>• Tony Ulwick: Early 1990s applications at Cordis Corporation, Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) methodology (Harvard Business Review, 2002), Seminal book "What Customers Want" (2005)<br>• Clayton Christensen: Influential 2005 HBR article "Marketing Malpractice", Expanded JTBD through "Competing Against Luck" (2016), Emphasized causal understanding of customer choices<br>• Key Figures: Tony Ulwick, Clayton Christensen, Bob Moesta<br>• Methodological differences: ODI vs. qualitative job stories approach|
|Comparison with Traditional Segmentation Approaches|• Traditional segmentation limitations: superficial attributes, correlations not causations<br>• JTBD approach: situational contexts, progress sought, constraints faced by customers<br>• Milkshake Example (Christensen): Traditional segmentation failed (flavors, pricing), JTBD revealed morning commuters' job: "entertainment and satiety during commute", Resulted in actionable innovation (thicker shakes, faster service)<br>• Markets defined by jobs rather than product categories<br>• Competition includes all possible solutions, not just similar products|
|Significance for Consumer Insights and Innovation|• Uncovers hidden needs through causal inquiry<br>• Identifies latent struggles and unmet needs<br>• Reveals opportunity gaps and non-consumption areas<br>• Drives product/service innovation tightly aligned with real customer needs<br>• Reduces innovation risk by focusing on causality rather than correlation|
|Examples from Literature or Industry Cases|• Milkshake for Breakfast: Identified specific commuter needs and constraints, Innovated product attributes (thickness, faster transactions)<br>• Intuit QuickBooks: Discovered small-business job: "just get my books done", Simple, targeted solution (fewer features, ease-of-use), capturing significant market share<br>• Cordis Corporation: Uncovered unmet cardiologist needs, developed specialized angioplasty balloons, Dramatic market success, from 1% to 20% market share<br>• Kimberly-Clark Depends: Identified emotional/social job related to dignity in adult incontinence, Designed discreet, underwear-like products, enhancing emotional acceptance|
|Impact on Business Strategy and Future Implications|• "Job as North Star": aligns teams around job outcomes<br>• Real-world success: Cox Automotive achieved 20x user growth via job-focused roadmap<br>• Redefines market boundaries around jobs<br>• Allows adaptive strategy in changing technology landscapes (Nike, SNHU cases)<br>• End-to-end journey alignment with jobs<br>• Marketing messages resonate by highlighting job-related outcomes (Moen faucets, OnStar)<br>• Integration with emerging technologies (AI, IoT) to better serve jobs<br>• Continuous evolution and refinement of jobs as societal and technological contexts evolve<br>• Ongoing relevance as markets increasingly prioritize customer-centric innovation|
## Task 1.3: Initial Draft

**Definition and Context:**
Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a knowledge framework that aims to understand the underlying goals that customers aim to accomplish when they 'hire' a product or service. Instead of pigeonholing customers into misleading demographic categories like age, income, or location, JTBD examines why customers make purchases in the first place - what job do they need done? The framework provides a methodology for uncovering the actual circumstances and motivations that drive customer decisions, which can be understood through three key dimensions that influence their choices .

1. Functional
2. Emotional
3. Social
