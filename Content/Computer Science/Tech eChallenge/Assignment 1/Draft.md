# Part 1: Understanding the JTBD Framework

**Introduction**
Despite collecting vast amounts of customer data, companies often struggle with product innovation. The culprit? An over-reliance on demographic research that reveals *who* buys products but fails to uncover *why* purchases occur. Clayton Christensen, innovation expert and author of "Competing Against Luck," observed that companies "know more about their customers than ever, yet innovation success remains hit-or-miss" (Christensen et al. 2016).

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework addresses this gap by shifting focus from customer attributes to customer objectives. Rather than asking "What kind of person would buy this product?" JTBD asks "What job is the customer trying to accomplish?". This perspective recognises that customers essentially "hire" products and services to help them make progress or solve problems in specific situations (Gavin 2020). When a product performs this job well, customers rehire it; when it performs poorly, they "fire" it and look for alternatives (Christensen et al. 2016).

**History**
The JTBD framework can be traced back to Harvard professor Theodore Levitt's famous observation: "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!" (Levitt, cited in 'JTBD Theory' n.d.). This insight shifted focus from products to outcomes, laying groundwork for future innovation thinking. Two pioneers formalised this concept into today's framework: Tony Ulwick, who applied jobs-focused approaches at Cordis Corporation in the early 1990s and published the first JTBD book "What Customers Want" (2005); and Clayton Christensen, whose "Marketing Malpractice" (2005) article and subsequent book "Competing Against Luck" (2016) established Jobs Theory as a cornerstone of innovation thinking (Ulwick 2017). Their work transformed a simple insight into a powerful framework that consistently uncovers why customers make purchase decisions.

**Defining JTBD**
In JTBD, a "job" is defined as "a statement that describes, with precision, what people are trying to accomplish in a given situation" (Ulwick 2017). Each job encompasses three dimensions:

- **Functional** (the practical objectives that need to be accomplished - what literally needs to get done)
- **Emotional** (how customers want to feel or avoid feeling during the process, such as confidence, satisfaction, or avoiding frustration)
- **Social** (how customers want to be perceived by others, including considerations of status, identity, and competence)

Understanding these three dimensions allows companies to see beyond surface-level customer attributes and focus on underlying motivations. This is why JTBD moves past traditional demographic segmentation - it identifies why products are hired regardless of who does the hiring.

For example, a 24-year-old marketing associate working long hours and a 60-year-old retiree with mobility challenges might both hire the same meal delivery service. Despite their demographic differences, they share the job of "having a convenient, high-quality meal without the burden of shopping, preparation, and cleanup." Demographic profiles fail to predict this purchasing behaviour because the causal mechanism is the job itself, not customer attributes.

**Real World Examples**
This principle has proven powerful when applied in business settings. Christensen's famous "milkshake morning" case study illustrates how identifying the true job transforms product development. A fast-food chain discovered that many customers purchased milkshakes early in the morning, consuming them alone during their commutes. These customers weren't hiring the milkshake for taste or nutrition, but to make a long, boring drive more bearable while staying full until lunch. The thick, viscous texture allowed it to last throughout the commute and was easier to consume while driving than alternatives like bagels (too crumbly) or bananas (consumed too quickly). Once the company understood this job, they focused on making shakes thicker and speeding up the purchase process; improvements that directly addressed the job requirements rather than demographic preferences (Christensen 2006).

Similarly, Intuit's QuickBooks emerged from recognising that small-business owners didn't want to become accountants; they simply wanted their "books done" with minimal effort. This insight led Intuit to develop a product with deliberately less functionality than competitors but in a simpler package that better accomplished the core job. QuickBooks quickly captured the majority of its market because it addressed what customers truly needed rather than offering feature parity with competitors (Kinni 2016).

**Future Innovation**
The success stories of the milkshake and QuickBooks demonstrate how understanding jobs transforms existing products, but JTBD's greater value lies in guiding future innovation and strategy. When companies define their markets by the jobs customers need done rather than by product categories, they gain a huge advantage. Instead of seeing themselves as "milkshake makers" or "software developers," they recognise their true role in fulfilling fundamental customer needs that remain stable even as technologies evolve. This perspective helps businesses identify adjacent innovation opportunities; a photography company might expand from cameras to cloud storage solutions once they define their market as "preserving memories" rather than "selling cameras." As emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and automation continue advancing, JTBD provides a framework for evaluating their potential: not by asking "How can we use this new technology?" but rather "Which customer jobs could this technology help accomplish more effectively?" This approach ensures innovation efforts remain grounded in actual customer needs rather than chasing technological trends, leading to higher success rates for new products and services while protecting against disruption from unexpected competitors (Kinni 2016).

**Conclusion**
The Jobs to Be Done framework transforms how businesses understand customer behaviour by focusing on the causal drivers behind purchases rather than demographic correlations. Moving from "who buys" to "why they buy" provides clarity that demographic data alone cannot deliver, enabling more precise product development and strategic positioning. When companies align their innovations with the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of customer jobs, they create solutions that resonate regardless of demographic boundaries.

# Part 2: Applying JTBD to a Real-World example

**Introduction** 
Coffee stands as one of the most widely consumed beverages, with a market valued at approximately $100 billion (Coffee Market Size, 2024). Coffee's universal appeal makes it an ideal candidate for a JTBD analysis, revealing why consumers "hire" coffee.

**Jobs and Goals:**
Coffee fulfils multiple customer needs that can be categorised across functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

| **Goal Type**        | **Key Examples**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

***Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) Framework: A Comprehensive Deep Dive***

**Introduction to JTBD**
**Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)** is an innovation framework that focuses on the underlying _jobs_ or goals that customers are trying to accomplish when they “hire” a product or service. In simple terms, JTBD shifts the perspective from _who_ the customer is to _why_ they make a purchase – emphasizing the _job_ they need done. Rather than viewing customers as mere buyers with static traits, JTBD sees them as agents seeking to make progress or solve problems in specific situations ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Firms%20have%20never%20known%20more,is%20trying%20to%20get%20done)) ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=This%20idea%20is%20the%20crux,%E2%80%9D)). When a person finds themselves with a task or problem – the “job” – they will **hire a product or service to do that job** for them ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=This%20idea%20is%20the%20crux,%E2%80%9D)). If the hired solution performs well, they’ll use it again; if it performs poorly, the customer will “fire” it and look for an alternative ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Some%20jobs%20are%20little%20,a%20crummy%20job%2C%20we%20%E2%80%9Cfire%E2%80%9D)). This seemingly simple idea – that consumers **“hire” products to do jobs** – is the crux of JTBD theory, offering a powerful lens to understand customer behavior at a causal level ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Christensen%20and%20his%20coauthors%20think,will%20yield%20a%20winning%20ticket)) ([Fullstory Blog Jobs to Be Done blog og image | Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/#:~:text=,they%20will%20hire%20that%20product)).

**Origins and Foundational Works**
The roots of JTBD thinking trace back decades in marketing theory. A famous adage attributed to Harvard professor Theodore Levitt captures the core insight: _“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!”_ ([Jobs-to-be-Done: The Theory & Methodology | Strategyn](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/#:~:text=Fundamentals%20of%20Jobs)). In other words, people purchase solutions **for the outcome or job** (the hole) rather than for the product itself (the drill). This idea was later expanded and formalized by innovation theorists in the 1990s and 2000s. **Tony Ulwick**, a pioneer of Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI), applied a jobs-focused approach as early as 1991–1993 at Cordis Corporation, helping the company refocus on unmet “jobs” of cardiologists and dramatically improving its product success (Cordis grew its angioplasty balloon market share from 1% to over 20% by targeting underserved jobs) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=The%20first%20documented%20success%20achieved,percent%20to%20over%2020%20percent)) ([Jobs-to-be-Done Examples and Applications](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-examples/#:~:text=Cordis%20Corporation%20gives%20us%20a,to%20over%2020)). Ulwick introduced JTBD concepts in a 2002 Harvard Business Review article titled _“Turn Customer Input into Innovation,”_ and authored _What Customers Want_ (2005) – noted as the first book on JTBD theory ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=The%20first%20documented%20success%20achieved,percent%20to%20over%2020%20percent)) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=To%20learn%20more%20about%20these,book%20written%20on%20this%20subject)).

Around the same time, **Clayton Christensen** (author of _The Innovator’s Dilemma_) and his collaborators (e.g. Bob Moesta, Taddy Hall) were independently developing the Jobs to Be Done theory. Christensen’s influential HBR piece _“Marketing Malpractice: The Cause and the Cure”_ (2005) argued that marketers had been “losing the forest for the trees” by focusing on demographic segments instead of the fundamental job the customer needed done ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=Marketers%20have%20lost%20the%20forest,inch%20hole)). In that article and subsequent works, Christensen emphasized that **the “job” – not the customer’s attributes – should be the fundamental unit of analysis** when developing products ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=With%20few%20exceptions%2C%20every%20job,products%20that%20customers%20will%20buy)). He and his co-authors further popularized JTBD through the book _Competing Against Luck_ (2016), which formally presented “Jobs Theory.” They explained that companies often know **who** their customers are, but not **why** those customers make certain choices; JTBD fills in that gap by revealing the causal reasons behind purchases ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Christensen%20and%20his%20coauthors%20think,will%20yield%20a%20winning%20ticket)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Competing%20Against%20Luck%20proposes%20that,clunkily%2C%20call%20the%20Theory%20of)). In Christensen’s words, innovation becomes far less hit-or-miss once you can ask _“What job is the customer hiring this product to do?”_ and design solutions around that job ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Competing%20Against%20Luck%20proposes%20that,clunkily%2C%20call%20the%20Theory%20of)).

**Key contributors** to JTBD include Clayton Christensen and Tony Ulwick, as mentioned, along with Bob Moesta (who worked with Christensen on early JTBD research in consumer behavior). Their combined foundational texts – Ulwick’s ODI methodology and Christensen’s Jobs Theory – laid the groundwork for the modern JTBD framework. (Notably, different schools of JTBD practice emerged: Ulwick’s approach centers on identifying and quantifying desired outcomes for a job, whereas Christensen/Moesta’s approach often involves deep customer interviews to uncover job “stories.” Despite methodological differences, both share the core premise that understanding the job brings predictability to innovation ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?.

A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=When%20a%20company%20thinks%20about,and%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation)).)

**Core Concepts of the JTBD Framework**
**Defining a “Job”:** In JTBD, a _“job”_ is the fundamental problem, task, or goal that a customer seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance. A formal definition by Ulwick describes a Job-to-be-Done as _“a statement that describes, with precision, what a group of people are trying to achieve or accomplish in a given situation”_ ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=%3E%20A%20JOB,they%20are%20trying%20to%20accomplish)). In practice, a job can be functional (a task to complete or problem to solve), but it also can encompass deeper goals – for example, “pass on life lessons to my children” or “find a more fulfilling career” are jobs people might seek to get done ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Firms%20have%20never%20known%20more,is%20trying%20to%20get%20done)) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=A%20job%20statement%20is%20written,done)). Crucially, jobs are defined independently of any particular solution or product – they are **solution-agnostic** aims. People will pursue the job using whatever solution is available or convenient, which might include hiring products, services, or even creating DIY workarounds ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=,to%20get%20a%20job%20done)).

**“Hiring” Products and the JTBD Mindset:** JTBD adopts a vivid metaphor of consumers as hiring managers. When someone has a job to be done, they will _hire_ a product or service as if it were an “employee” to carry out that job ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=This%20idea%20is%20the%20crux,%E2%80%9D)). If the product succeeds, it’s effectively a good employee and will be hired again; if not, it gets “fired” (the customer switches to an alternative) ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Some%20jobs%20are%20little%20,a%20crummy%20job%2C%20we%20%E2%80%9Cfire%E2%80%9D)). This framing encourages businesses to ask not “How do we get customers to buy _our_ product?”, but rather “What job is the customer trying to accomplish, and how can our product do that job better?” It flips the perspective to **view products as means to an end (the customer’s desired outcome)** ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Competing%20Against%20Luck%20proposes%20that,clunkily%2C%20call%20the%20Theory%20of)). Christensen encapsulated this idea: _“When people find themselves needing to get a job done, they essentially hire products to do that job for them... If a business can understand the job and design a product (and associated experiences) to do that job well, then customers will hire that product”_ ([Fullstory Blog Jobs to Be Done blog og image | Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/#:~:text=,they%20will%20hire%20that%20product)). This means that a truly customer-centric innovation process starts with understanding the job context and desired outcomes, then **designing the product, its features, and even the purchase or usage experience around executing that job** ([Fullstory Blog Jobs to Be Done blog og image | Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/#:~:text=,they%20will%20hire%20that%20product)).

**Functional, Social, and Emotional Dimensions:** Every job has multiple facets. Christensen observes that “with few exceptions, every job people need or want to do has a functional, a social, and an emotional dimension” ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=With%20few%20exceptions%2C%20every%20job,products%20that%20customers%20will%20buy)). The **functional dimension** is the practical task or objective (the core “problem to solve”). The **emotional dimension** involves how the customer wants to feel or avoid feeling as they get the job done – this could include feelings of security, confidence, joy, or avoiding frustration and anxiety. The **social dimension** relates to how the customer wants to be perceived by others or fit into social contexts when using the solution ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=Beyond%20meeting%20a%20need%2C%20jobs,from%20owning%20or%20using%20it)). Understanding all three dimensions allows a product or service to be _precisely targeted to the job_ in a holistic way ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=With%20few%20exceptions%2C%20every%20job,products%20that%20customers%20will%20buy)). For instance, an adult with incontinence isn’t just seeking the functional job of “contain leaks”; there is an emotional/social job of maintaining dignity and normalcy. Kimberly-Clark’s research into this job led to the design of Depends undergarments that looked and felt more like regular underwear, directly addressing the stigma issue – a key emotional/social component – and contributing to the product’s success ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=how%20to%20do%20their%20books,There%E2%80%99s%20GM%E2%80%99s%20OnStar)). By contrast, an exclusively functional view might miss such insights. Thus, JTBD theory insists on capturing the **“full job”**: the bundle of functional goals and emotional/social drivers that truly motivate the customer ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=With%20few%20exceptions%2C%20every%20job,products%20that%20customers%20will%20buy)) ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=Beyond%20meeting%20a%20need%2C%20jobs,from%20owning%20or%20using%20it)).

**Job-Centric vs. Product-Centric Thinking:** A core tenet of JTBD is making the _job_ (not the product, not the customer segment) the primary unit of analysis ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=With%20few%20exceptions%2C%20every%20job,products%20that%20customers%20will%20buy)). This has several implications:

- A **market** can be defined not by a product category or a demographic, but by _all the people who need to get a particular job done_. For example, instead of thinking of the “camera market,” one might consider the market for “helping people preserve memories” – which could include cameras, photo apps, scrapbooks, etc., any solution that serves that job. As Ulwick explains, markets should be seen as “groups of people trying to get a job done” ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=,to%20get%20the%20job%20done)).
    
- **Customer “needs”** are redefined as the criteria that customers use to measure success in getting the job done ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=,to%20get%20a%20job%20done)). In JTBD, needs are not vague desires; they can be described as _desired outcomes_ of the job (e.g., “minimize the time to accomplish X,” “increase the likelihood of Y outcome”) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=discovered%20by%20studying%20the%20customer%E2%80%99s,outcomes%2C%E2%80%9D%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation)). These outcome statements can be surprisingly stable over time if the job itself is stable ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=When%20a%20company%20thinks%20about,and%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation)). This stability is valuable – it means companies can target improving those outcomes consistently, even as particular technologies or fashions change.
    
- **Competitive landscape** is broadened. Your competition isn’t just companies making similar products – it’s _anything the customer might hire to do the same job_ ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=use%20to%20measure%20success%20when,to%20get%20a%20job%20done)). A famous illustration: a drill manufacturer’s competition isn’t only other drill brands; it’s any way to make a hole (perhaps new laser cutters, or simply hiring a handyman). Likewise, if a commuter’s job is “have an engaging breakfast during my drive,” a fast-food milkshake’s competitors included bananas, bagels, donuts – any substitute a commuter might “hire” for that job ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=The%20researcher%20inquired%20further%3A%20,commute%20problem.%20They%20could)). This perspective can alert businesses to disruptive threats outside their traditional product category and inspire cross-industry innovation.
    
- **Customer segmentation** shifts from demographics to job-based segments. Traditional segmentation might group people by age, gender, income, or psychographics. JTBD segmentation groups customers by the job or by how they struggle with the job ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=solution%20being%20used%20to%20get,to%20get%20a%20job%20done)). Often, people from very different demographics turn out to hire the same product for the same job. Conversely, a single demographic group might have multiple different jobs they need done, implying they aren’t a homogeneous segment at all. By segmenting customers based on the jobs-to-be-done (and the extent to which those jobs are over- or under-served), companies get a more **precise view of customer motivations** ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Jobs,traditional%20demographics%2C%20attributes%2C%20or%20characteristics)). For example, one subgroup of customers might hire a fitness app to _“train for a marathon”_ while another hires the _same_ app to _“have fun being active with friends.”_ These are distinct jobs implying different feature priorities, even if the users look similar on paper.
    

Another important concept is that **jobs tend to be stable over time** (as posited by JTBD theory) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=1,get%20a%20job%20done%20better)). While technologies and fashions evolve rapidly, the underlying human jobs (the goals we want to achieve) change more slowly. For instance, people have long wanted to “listen to music on the go” – from transistor radios to Walkmans to iPods to streaming phones, the solutions changed but the fundamental job remained. This stability means a company that identifies the real job can focus on it as a North Star even as they update their product; the job provides a consistent target for innovation ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=When%20a%20company%20thinks%20about,and%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation)). (A caveat: jobs are generally stable, but as discussed later, some critics note they can evolve with societal shifts – see **Limitations** section.)

## JTBD vs. Traditional Segmentation and Needs Analysis

JTBD represents a shift away from traditional marketing approaches that rely on demographic or psychographic profiles. **Conventional segmentation** often assumes that if you define a narrow customer profile (e.g. “18–34 year-old tech-savvy males in urban areas”) and build a product for that “target customer,” you will succeed. In practice, this can lead to a focus on superficial attributes rather than actual customer problems. Christensen observed that firms “know more about their customers than ever, yet innovation success remains hit-or-miss” because they focus on correlations in data (who buys what) instead of the causal mechanism (what job were they trying to do) ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Firms%20have%20never%20known%20more,is%20trying%20to%20get%20done)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Christensen%20and%20his%20coauthors%20think,will%20yield%20a%20winning%20ticket)). A classic pitfall is developing feature-rich products tailored to a fictional persona, only to find that those features don’t actually solve an important job for the customer.

JTBD offers a contrasting approach: **segment by jobs-to-be-done**. This means looking at the situations that prompt a customer to use a product and the goal they’re pursuing, rather than their traits. As one source puts it, _“customer segments aren’t based on demographics or psychographics; they are based on how customers struggle differently to get a job done.”_ ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=solution%20being%20used%20to%20get,to%20get%20a%20job%20done)). A compelling illustration comes from the **fast-food milkshake example** originally told by Christensen. A restaurant initially segmented its milkshake customers by demographic profiles and asked those segments for feedback on improving the milkshake (thickness, flavor, price, etc.) ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=To%20see%20why%2C%20consider%20one,had%20no%20impact%20on%20sales)). Changes were made according to what the “target demographic” said – yet sales didn’t improve at all ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=personality%20characteristics%20of%20those%20customers,had%20no%20impact%20on%20sales)). The traditional segmentation approach had failed to reveal the real reasons people bought milkshakes.

It was only after researchers reframed the question to “What job are customers hiring these milkshakes to do?” that the company uncovered the insight that **morning commuters** formed an important segment with a specific job: they “hired” a milkshake to keep themselves occupied and sated during a long, boring commute ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=anything%20else%3B%20and%20they%20consumed,their%20shakes%20in%20their%20cars)) ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=Sometimes%2C%20he%20learned%2C%20they%20bought,they%20were%20hiring%20the%20milk)). Those commuters didn’t neatly fit a single demographic bucket – but as a _job-defined_ segment, they were extremely telling. By contrast, the same product (milkshake) in the afternoon was being hired by parents as a treat to quiet their children (a very different job) ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=,the%20fundamental%20unit%20of%20analysis)). This example shows how JTBD cuts across traditional segments: the _context and job_ define the segment more meaningfully than age or gender. In summary, JTBD differs from traditional approaches by focusing on _situational context, progress sought,_ and _constraints_ (the essence of the job), rather than assuming that shared customer attributes equal shared needs ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=Marketers%20have%20lost%20the%20forest,inch%20hole)) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=solution%20being%20used%20to%20get,to%20get%20a%20job%20done)). This often explains _why_ a product that appeals to one group can flop with another group that looks similar externally – they may have distinct jobs to be done.

## Real-World Examples of JTBD in Action

([Fullstory Blog Jobs to Be Done blog og image | Fullstory](https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/)) _Figure: A stylized depiction of a milkshake. Christensen’s famous “milkshake test” case study showed how customers in the early morning were “hiring” a fast-food chain’s milkshake to do the job of providing a convenient, engaging breakfast during a long commute ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=anything%20else%3B%20and%20they%20consumed,their%20shakes%20in%20their%20cars)) ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=Sometimes%2C%20he%20learned%2C%20they%20bought,they%20were%20hiring%20the%20milk)). Understanding this job (staving off mid-morning hunger and boredom for drivers) led the company to adjust the product and service – for example, making the shakes thicker (so they last longer) and offering quicker drive-thru service – to better fulfill that job ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=In%20Disruptive%20Strategy%2C%20Christensen%20uses,effective%20at%20accomplishing%20that%20job)) ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20HBR,get%20to%20work%20on%20time))._

The Jobs to Be Done framework has been applied across industries, often with striking results. Below are a few notable examples drawn from business literature and case studies, illustrating JTBD in action:

- **“Milkshake for Breakfast” – Fast-Food Chain:** This is perhaps the most cited JTBD example, introduced by Clayton Christensen. A fast-food company struggling to improve milkshake sales discovered through JTBD analysis that many milkshakes were bought early in the morning by commuters, who bought nothing else ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=purchased%2C%20whether%20these%20consumers%20were,their%20shakes%20in%20their%20cars)) ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=anything%20else%3B%20and%20they%20consumed,their%20shakes%20in%20their%20cars)). These customers weren’t buying a milkshake because of traditional factors like flavor or price; they had a _job_: to make their long commute more enjoyable and to ward off mid-morning hunger in a tidy way. The milkshake, with its viscous texture and easy-to-hold cup, outperformed alternatives like bagels (which were dry and crumbly) or bananas (which didn’t last through the morning) in doing this job ([What Customers Want from Your Products | Working Knowledge](https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products#:~:text=The%20researcher%20inquired%20further%3A%20,commute%20problem.%20They%20could)). By recognizing the **functional job** (“fill me up and entertain me on my drive”) and the **constraints** (must be one-hand friendly, not messy, relatively long-lasting), the company could innovate accordingly. They realized their competition in the morning wasn’t other shakes; it was bananas, donuts, etc. The outcome: recommendations such as speeding up the purchase process (to suit commuters in a hurry by using prepaid cards) and making shakes even thicker (to extend the consumption time) were made to better satisfy this job ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=product%20can%20satisfy%20a%20job,effective%20at%20accomplishing%20that%20job)) ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=prepaid%20card%20that%20allows%20them,get%20to%20work%20on%20time)). This example vividly demonstrates how JTBD uncovers customer motivations that traditional analysis missed – once the job was understood, the company saw new ways to make the product more “hirable” for that job.
    
- **Intuit QuickBooks – “Just Get My Books Done”:** Intuit, a financial software company, provides a classic example of using JTBD to spot innovation opportunities. In the mid-1990s, Intuit noticed something odd: many small-business owners were repurposing Intuit’s personal finance software (Quicken) to do their small-business bookkeeping ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=appointed%20president%20of%20SNHU%20in,nontraditional%20students%20like%20traditional%20students)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=SNHU%20is%20only%20one%20of,There%E2%80%99s%20GM%E2%80%99s%20OnStar)). In JTBD terms, these entrepreneurs were “hiring” Quicken – a product designed for individual/home finances – to do the _job_ of managing business finances, because they had no better solution. Recognizing this unmet job, Intuit developed **QuickBooks**, a product tailored to “help me manage my small business finances easily.” QuickBooks deliberately kept things simple – it offered roughly _half the functionality of more sophisticated accounting software, at twice the price_ – because Intuit realized small business owners didn’t want to become accountants; they _“just wanted their books done.”_ ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=SNHU%20is%20only%20one%20of,There%E2%80%99s%20GM%E2%80%99s%20OnStar)). QuickBooks’ overwhelming success (quickly capturing the majority of its market) came from focusing on the true job-to-be-done for the customer, not on feature parity with competitor products. This case also highlights how JTBD can reveal _nonconsumption_: before QuickBooks, many small businesses weren’t using any formal accounting system (or were hacking consumer software) – a huge opportunity once the job was identified.
    
- **Cordis Corporation – Medical Device Innovation:** In 1993, Cordis (a medical device maker) was struggling in the angioplasty balloon market. Using a JTBD/ODI approach, they investigated what interventional cardiologists _really needed_ (the jobs and outcomes) during angioplasty procedures ([Jobs-to-be-Done Examples and Applications](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-examples/#:~:text=Cordis%20Corporation%20gives%20us%20a,to%20over%2020)). They uncovered numerous specific “jobs” or performance criteria that were underserved by existing balloon catheters (for example, precise navigation through arteries, better durability, easier inflation/deflation – details from the case indicate about a dozen unmet needs) ([Jobs-to-be-Done Examples and Applications](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-examples/#:~:text=Cordis%20Corporation%20gives%20us%20a,to%20over%2020)). Cordis then engineered **19 new balloon products** each addressing those specific jobs. The results were dramatic: every one of those new products became #1 or #2 in the market, and Cordis’s overall market share leapt from a meager 1% to over 20% ([Jobs-to-be-Done Examples and Applications](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-examples/#:~:text=Cordis%20Corporation%20gives%20us%20a,to%20over%2020)). This case, documented by Ulwick, stands as one of the earliest proof points for JTBD-driven innovation. It shows how a systematic focus on jobs (and associated outcomes) can uncover latent customer needs and drive a whole portfolio of successful innovations.
    
- **Consumer Goods – Diapers and Beyond:** JTBD insights often lead to reframing of products in consumer markets as well. Earlier we mentioned **Kimberly-Clark’s Depend** adult diapers. By examining the job of managing adult incontinence, the company learned it wasn’t merely about absorbency (functional) but also about allowing users to feel dignified and unembarrassed (emotional/social). That insight led to product design changes (making adult diapers resemble regular underwear) which helped Depends become a market leader by better fitting the real job to be done ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=how%20to%20do%20their%20books,There%E2%80%99s%20GM%E2%80%99s%20OnStar)). Another example comes from **General Motors’ OnStar** telematics service. OnStar was initially marketed as a luxury “concierge” feature, but it saw limited adoption. Through a jobs lens, GM realized customers primarily wanted **24/7 safety and emergency help** in their cars – the job was not glamour, but peace of mind. Once OnStar repositioned around the job of “get help in a vehicle emergency,” emphasizing crash response and roadside assistance, its usage and subscriber base grew significantly ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=struggle%20attached%20to%20adult%20incontinence%2C,%E2%80%9CIn%20every%20case%2C%E2%80%9D)). These examples show how identifying the true job can guide both product design and **positioning** in the market.
    

Each of these cases illustrates the central payoff of JTBD: by uncovering _why_ customers “hire” a product, companies can innovate in ways that are tightly aligned with real customer goals. Whether it’s a service tweak (like faster milkshake service), a new product launch (QuickBooks), a suite of product improvements (Cordis’s balloons), or a marketing pivot (OnStar’s messaging), the JTBD framework helps ensure those changes resonate with the actual jobs customers care about.

## How JTBD Uncovers Customer Motivations and Fuels Innovation Opportunities

At its heart, the JTBD framework is a tool for uncovering **customer motivations** at a deeper level than traditional research. By asking “What job is the customer trying to get done?” and “Why are they hiring this solution?”, companies access the _causal factors_ behind customer behaviors ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Christensen%20and%20his%20coauthors%20think,will%20yield%20a%20winning%20ticket)). This causal insight is incredibly powerful for innovation. Christensen notes that without understanding the cause (the job), companies rely on luck and extensive trial-and-error in product development – one reason that 75–85% of new products fail financially ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSomewhere%20between%2075%20and%2085,%E2%80%9D)). JTBD theory directly addresses this problem by providing a method to discover the cause: find the job-to-be-done that is not adequately served and aim your innovation there ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Excerpted%20from%20the%20forthcoming%20book%2C,companies%20can%20improve%20innovation%20success)).

**Uncovering Hidden Needs:** Customers often struggle to articulate their needs in terms of product features, but they can describe the tasks they are trying to accomplish or the obstacles they face. JTBD techniques (like in-depth interviews and “job stories”) help surface these underlying jobs, including latent needs the customer might not explicitly mention in surveys ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20enormously%20challenging,hires%20products%20and%20services%20for)) ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=analysis%20to%20comprehensively%20map%20out,job%20in%20detail)). For example, commuters didn’t ask for a “thicker milkshake” in a survey – that insight emerged by examining the job of alleviating boredom and hunger, then deducing what product attributes would better fulfill it ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=don%E2%80%99t%20order%20any%20other%20menu,effective%20at%20accomplishing%20that%20job)). In general, JTBD-driven research often reveals **opportunity gaps**: places where customers have cobbled together makeshift solutions or where they settle for imperfect results. These gaps are seeds for innovation. As one author put it, “uncovering why customers make choices allows organizations to better create solutions that get hired” ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=customers%20really%20wanted%20done%20was,%E2%80%9D)) – meaning a product tightly aligned with a real job will essentially market itself, because it fits like a key in a lock.

**From Jobs to Innovation Ideas:** Once a job is identified, teams can brainstorm how to fulfill it better. This might involve new product concepts or improvements to existing offerings. For instance, after understanding the commuter’s job, the fast-food chain came up with ideas (prepaid swipe cards, even thicker shakes, etc.) that specifically target the job’s criteria ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20HBR,get%20to%20work%20on%20time)). These ideas were quite different from the standard product tweaks one might do without that insight. Similarly, Intuit recognized that small businesses “just wanting their books done” meant simplicity and integration were more important than adding advanced accounting features – which guided QuickBooks’ feature set ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=that%20are%20described%20in%20Competing,There%E2%80%99s%20Kimberly)). A JTBD perspective also broadens the solution space: by defining the job independently of current products, it encourages out-of-the-box thinking. A company might realize the job could be addressed with a totally new approach or technology. For example, if the job is “remember past conversations with friends” and people are hiring social media for it today, a company might invent a personal AI journal to do it better – an innovation that wouldn’t emerge from just studying existing social media user demographics.

Another aspect is **identifying non-consumption**: JTBD analysis often asks, “What do people do if they can’t find a good solution – do they hire a workaround, or do nothing at all?” ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=that%20are%20described%20in%20Competing,that%20the%20job%20that%20its)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=service%2C%20which%20didn%E2%80%99t%20take%20off,%E2%80%9D)). Non-consumption (customers not using any product because nothing fits their job) is a strong signal of an innovation opportunity. The QuickBooks story is an example: many small businesses were essentially “non-consumers” of formal accounting software before QuickBooks, because available tools overshot their job. By targeting non-consumers with a just-right solution, Intuit tapped a vast new market. Likewise, SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) in our earlier example realized that many working adults weren’t being served by traditional college programs (they were effectively non-consumers of higher education or dropping out), so by tailoring an online program to their job-to-be-done, SNHU unlocked huge enrollment growth ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=appointed%20president%20of%20SNHU%20in,nontraditional%20students%20like%20traditional%20students)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=accounted%20for%20SHNU%E2%80%99s%20growth%20spurt%3F,nontraditional%20students%20like%20traditional%20students)).

**Creating Value and Reducing Innovation Risk:** By aligning product development tightly with jobs-to-be-done, companies can significantly improve their innovation hit rate. Because JTBD focuses on **the cause of purchase decisions**, products conceptualized this way are more likely to address something customers truly care about (as opposed to being a “solution looking for a problem”). In Christensen’s words, JTBD can _“transform your understanding of customer choice in a way that no amount of data ever could, because it gets at the causal driver behind a purchase.”_ ([Know Your Customers' "Jobs to Be Done" | Innosight](https://www.innosight.com/insight/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Excerpted%20from%20the%20forthcoming%20book%2C,companies%20can%20improve%20innovation%20success)). This causal knowledge makes innovation more predictable – rather than guessing what features might appeal to a demographic, you’re designing against a known job definition. Tony Ulwick similarly argues that with a stable job as the unit of analysis, customer needs can be defined as specific outcome metrics, and innovation essentially becomes a process of systematically improving those outcomes ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=When%20a%20company%20thinks%20about,and%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation)). Companies have even developed quantitative JTBD methods (like Ulwick’s Outcome-Driven Innovation surveys) to prioritize which “job outcomes” are most underserved, adding rigor to opportunity selection ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=discovered%20by%20studying%20the%20customer%E2%80%99s,outcomes%2C%E2%80%9D%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation)) ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=Since%20the%20customer%E2%80%99s%20job,a%20company%20is%20able%20to)). While the techniques can vary, the strategic benefit is the same: JTBD provides **clarity about where to innovate**. Instead of random brainstorming or copying competitors, the team has a clear mandate: make it dramatically easier for customers to get Job X done.

In summary, JTBD helps organizations uncover the “why” behind customer behaviors – their true motivations and objectives – and in doing so, it highlights where customers are struggling. Those struggles and unmet jobs are golden opportunities for innovation, whether it means inventing a new product, adding a service layer, or simply repositioning an offering to better match what people are really trying to achieve.

## Using JTBD in Business Strategy and Product Development

Beyond individual product innovation, Jobs to Be Done has broad applications in guiding **business strategy, product development, and even organizational alignment**. Adopting a JTBD mindset can influence decisions at multiple levels:

- **Product Development & Roadmapping:** Teams can use the job as a “north star” throughout the development process ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Keep%20the%20core%20job%20the,throughout%20the%20entire%20development%20process)) ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=features%20and%20messaging%20that%20map,all%20development%2C%20not%20just%20features)). This means continually asking during design: _Does this feature/decision help the customer get the job done better or faster?_ By focusing on the job’s critical outcomes, developers avoid over-engineering things that don’t add value to the job. For example, a software team at Cox Automotive used JTBD research to discover which subset of auto dealers had an unmet job in inventory management, and then refocused their product roadmap to serve those specific job outcomes – resulting in a product that drove a **20× increase** in their install base by squarely hitting the mark for that job ([Jobs-to-be-Done Examples and Applications](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-examples/#:~:text=A%20stellar%2C%20real,to%20redefine%20their%20product%20roadmap)). In practice, JTBD can be integrated with agile development: job stories (e.g. “When I [situation], I want to [job], so I can [outcome].”) are sometimes used in lieu of user stories to ensure feature ideas remain anchored to the job’s context and purpose.
    
- **Customer Experience & Journey Design:** Understanding the full job often illuminates all the steps a customer goes through (what Ulwick calls the “job map” ([What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?. Is Jobs-to-be-Done a theory? A lens? A… | by Tony Ulwick | JTBD + Outcome-Driven Innovation](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb#:~:text=discovered%20by%20studying%20the%20customer%E2%80%99s,outcomes%2C%E2%80%9D%20bring%20predictability%20to%20innovation))). Businesses can improve not just the core product but also the **surrounding customer experience** to smooth each step of the job. For instance, in the milkshake case, the company realized that part of the job was “get breakfast without being late to work,” which led them to streamline the ordering process (e.g., adding a prepaid swipe card option) ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20HBR,get%20to%20work%20on%20time)). In general, companies might identify points where customers struggle in pre- or post-purchase steps related to the job and innovate there (such as offering installation services, how-to content, better support, etc., to help get the job done). This end-to-end view aligns the **customer journey** with the job’s progression.
    
- **Strategic Positioning and Market Selection:** JTBD can inform which markets a business considers itself in. If you define your business by the job you fulfill rather than the product you make, it opens up strategic flexibility. A oft-cited recommendation is _“design a business around a job-to-be-done, rather than around a product that may become obsolete.”_ ([Jobs-to-be-Done: The Theory & Methodology | Strategyn](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/#:~:text=Design%20a%20business%20around%20a,more%20likely%20to%20disrupt%20itself)). By doing so, a company can continually evolve its offerings to serve that job better, even as technology or customer preferences shift. For example, Nike might view itself not just as an athletic apparel company, but in the business of “helping athletes (and everyday people) achieve fitness and performance goals” – a job-focused view that justifies moves into fitness apps, coaching platforms, etc. We saw how **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)** effectively redefined its market by focusing on the job of non-traditional adult learners (e.g. working parents, military personnel) who wanted to advance their education ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=appointed%20president%20of%20SNHU%20in,nontraditional%20students%20like%20traditional%20students)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=accounted%20for%20SHNU%E2%80%99s%20growth%20spurt%3F,nontraditional%20students%20like%20traditional%20students)). By tailoring its strategy (online programs, credit for experience, proactive coaching) to do that job well, SNHU achieved remarkable growth while many traditional universities stagnated ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=Southern%20New%20Hampshire%20University%20,heading%20off%20to%20a%20four)) ([The “Jobs to Be Done” Theory of Innovation](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Jobs-to-Be-Done-Theory-of-Innovation#:~:text=SNHU%20is%20only%20one%20of,There%E2%80%99s%20GM%E2%80%99s%20OnStar)). Thus, JTBD can guide high-level strategy decisions about _which customer jobs to serve_ and _which to leave to others_, ensuring the company’s value proposition is tightly aligned with an important job.
    
- **Marketing and Messaging:** Marketing teams can leverage JTBD insights to craft more resonant messaging – essentially _speaking to the job_. Traditional marketing might highlight product features or demographic appeals (“The creamy, tasty shake for young customers on-the-go!”). A JTBD-informed message focuses on the outcome (“Keeps you full and energized through your busy morning”). By articulating how the product enables the customer’s desired progress, marketers can make campaigns that immediately connect with the struggles or goals the audience recognizes ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Marketing)) ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=,the%20specific%20gains%20they%20seek)). For example, when Moen, a faucet manufacturer, realized that homeowners were “hiring” kitchen faucets to help prepare meals efficiently (job: meal prep & cleanup), they could market certain faucets on the platform of “making cooking easier” rather than just style or finish. Additionally, understanding the social/emotional job can guide brand tone – e.g. Depends commercials focus on confidence and normal life, aligning with the emotional job of dignity.
    
- **Organizational Alignment:** Some companies have gone so far as to restructure or create teams around jobs-to-be-done. For instance, Intercom (a customer messaging software firm) organized its product teams not by feature, but by the job their customers were trying to do (e.g. “Acquire new customers,” “Support customers”) – each team was responsible for all features that help accomplish that job. This ensures cross-functional alignment, with product development, marketing, and support all centered on excelling at a specific job. While not every company will reorganize formally, even adopting JTBD as a shared vocabulary can align departments. It provides a common focal point: designers, engineers, and marketers can all frame their decisions in terms of serving the same customer job. Over time, this can cultivate a more **customer-centric culture**, as employees constantly think about how to better solve customer jobs rather than just pushing the latest technology.
    
- **R&D and Innovation Investment:** JTBD can guide where to invest in new capabilities. Christensen and others suggest that companies should focus R&D efforts on finding better ways to get the target jobs done ([Jobs-to-be-Done: The Theory & Methodology | Strategyn](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/#:~:text=Focus%20R%26D%20and%20M%26A%20efforts,such%20investments%20should%20be%20made)). If a company knows “which job we’re trying to be the best in the world at,” it can direct research to that domain. This also affects partnerships and acquisitions – a firm might acquire another company because it helps them fulfill more of the customer’s job (for example, a company making home cleaning appliances might acquire a robotic vacuum startup to address the job of “keep my floors clean” more completely). Moreover, **jobs-based segmentation** can reveal high-value segments willing to pay more for a superior job solution ([Jobs-to-be-Done: The Theory & Methodology | Strategyn](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/#:~:text=Target%20those%20who%20will%20pay,get%20the%20job%20done%20worse)) (as Strategyn notes, targeting those who value the job most can be a profitable strategy, versus always racing to the lowest cost). All these strategic moves stem from the clarity that JTBD provides about _what customers truly value_ and _where there’s room to do the job better_. In fact, proponents claim JTBD thinking can even predict the likelihood of disruption: if incumbents are ignoring an important job (or part of a job) that customers struggle with, it leaves an opening for entrants to satisfy that job and capture the market ([Jobs to Be Done: 4 Real-World Examples | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/jobs-to-be-done-examples#:~:text=feelings%20you%20get%20from%20owning,or%20using%20it)).
    

In short, JTBD isn’t just a product design tool – it’s a strategic framework that can influence how a business defines its market, allocates resources, and measures success. Some organizations incorporate JTBD metrics (e.g. how well are we satisfying this job?) into their innovation scorecards. Others use jobs as the starting point for their **strategy formulation**, ensuring that everything from value proposition to customer experience is built around delivering on the job-to-be-done.

## Limitations and Critiques of JTBD

While the Jobs to Be Done framework has proven insightful, it is not without critiques and challenges. It’s important to acknowledge some limitations that researchers and practitioners have noted:

- **Complexity of Uncovering Jobs:** Identifying the full spectrum of jobs customers are trying to get done can be challenging. Customers often have a _“complex web of functional and emotional jobs”_ in their lives, many of which are not immediately obvious ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Difficult%20to%20fully%20understand%20all,jobs%20a%20customer%20hires%20for)). Even with extensive interviews and ethnographic research, a team might miss certain infrequent or context-specific jobs that nonetheless matter to some users ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20enormously%20challenging,hires%20products%20and%20services%20for)). In the real world, people might improvise new “jobs” or new ways to describe their needs that researchers hadn’t anticipated. This means JTBD research needs to be thorough and creative, and even then, **there are limits to how much you can uncover** – there’s a risk of unknown needs remaining hidden ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=nuance%20of%20when%20a%20job,arises%20for%20a%20customer)). In summary, JTBD analysis is only as good as the research behind it; if the discovery process is shallow, the outcomes won’t capture the true jobs.
    
- **Jobs Can Evolve Over Time:** A point of debate is the JTBD assertion that jobs are relatively stable. Critics argue that while many jobs are stable, some _do_ change as technology and culture change. Customers’ priorities can shift, or entirely new jobs can emerge. One source notes that jobs “are not static or stationary – they evolve dynamically as customers’ situations and contexts change” ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=The%20jobs%20customers%20seek%20to,situations%2C%20needs%2C%20and%20contexts%20change)). For example, the job of “stay informed about news” today might entail different expectations (real-time updates, personalized content) than it did a decade ago, due to smartphones and social media. Therefore, a JTBD analysis isn’t a one-and-done exercise; companies must continually revisit and update their understanding of customers’ jobs. If taken as a static snapshot, JTBD could mislead companies to stick with an old view of the customer while the world moves on. Practitioners address this by treating JTBD as an ongoing practice, re-validating jobs through continuous customer engagement ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=A%20job%20that%20is%20important,while%20new%20unmet%20jobs%20emerge)).
    
- **Overemphasis on Functional Jobs:** There is a temptation for companies (especially engineering-driven ones) to interpret JTBD too narrowly as a functional spec sheet, neglecting emotional and social elements. Some critiques point out that JTBD, if poorly implemented, “risks over-prioritizing functional, practical jobs” like speed, efficiency, cost, etc., while underemphasizing the subtler emotional jobs (confidence, status, aesthetics, etc.) ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Can%20over,emotional%2Fsocial)). Because functional needs are easier to measure, teams might focus on those and declare success (“Our new drill makes holes 10% faster!”), yet they might miss that customers also cared about how the tool made them _feel_ (perhaps confident and professional). The **richness of JTBD requires discipline to explore emotional and social drivers**, not just the obvious tasks. Without that balance, solutions may still fall flat even if they technically do the job, because they don’t resonate with the customer’s identity or feelings. The remedy is ensuring research and analysis explicitly probe emotional/social needs and that those findings influence design decisions ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=It%20may%20underemphasize%20important%20emotional,belonging%2C%20identity%2C%20and%20social%20status)).
    
- **Integration with Existing Methods:** Some product teams have noted that it can be tricky to integrate JTBD with other design and research practices they use, like personas or user stories. Personas, for instance, capture “who” the customer is, which JTBD de-emphasizes. Rather than abandon personas, some suggest using them in a limited way alongside JTBD – e.g. keep personas for empathy, but use jobs as the key for ideation ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Personas%20aim%20to%20create%20archetypal,a%20fictional%20but%20representative%20profile)) ([Introduction To Jobs To Be Done | AWA Digital](https://www.awa-digital.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/#:~:text=Jobs,to%20achieve%20in%20their%20lives)). There can be initial confusion or learning curve as organizations reconcile JTBD with traditional frameworks. Ensuring that JTBD insights complement rather than conflict with existing user research requires careful communication and possibly retraining teams to think in terms of jobs.
    
- **Practical Difficulties and Organizational Buy-In:** Implementing JTBD fully can demand significant time and cultural change. Critics like entrepreneur Eric Paley have quipped that JTBD is a great theory but often “patchy in practice” because many companies struggle to do the deep work required (extensive customer interviews, clustering analysis of qualitative data, etc.) and to act on those insights consistently ([Why 'Jobs-to-be-Done' Doesn't Work and What You Should be Doing Instead | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-jobs-to-be-done-doesnt-work-and-what-you-should-be-doing-instead#:~:text=Great%20Theory%2C%20Patchy%20Practice)) ([Why 'Jobs-to-be-Done' Doesn't Work and What You Should be Doing Instead | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-jobs-to-be-done-doesnt-work-and-what-you-should-be-doing-instead#:~:text=Intercom%20and%20Basecamp%20were%20two,month%20engagement%20for%20them)). In some cases, organizations treat JTBD as a one-off workshop exercise and then revert to business as usual – yielding little benefit. Additionally, consulting firms that specialize in JTBD (including those led by its pioneers) have proprietary nuances in their methods, which sometimes makes outsiders feel that the “secret sauce” isn’t fully transparent ([Why 'Jobs-to-be-Done' Doesn't Work and What You Should be Doing Instead | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-jobs-to-be-done-doesnt-work-and-what-you-should-be-doing-instead#:~:text=)) ([Why 'Jobs-to-be-Done' Doesn't Work and What You Should be Doing Instead | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-jobs-to-be-done-doesnt-work-and-what-you-should-be-doing-instead#:~:text=So%20they%20always%20leave%20out,all%20of%20his%20secrets%20either)). This has led to a perception by some that JTBD is hard to execute without expert guidance, potentially limiting its accessibility. Finally, company culture can be a barrier: truly adopting JTBD might require teams to question long-held assumptions about their market or reorganize responsibilities around jobs, which management might resist. In fast-paced environments where quick wins are needed, the thorough research phase JTBD demands may be hard to justify. Indeed, one commentator noted that firms often “need solutions yesterday,” so they don’t invest the time to deeply understand customer jobs, undermining their JTBD efforts ([Why 'Jobs-to-be-Done' Doesn't Work and What You Should be Doing Instead | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/why-jobs-to-be-done-doesnt-work-and-what-you-should-be-doing-instead#:~:text=Companies%20must%20be%20willing%20to,fire%20and%20need%20solutions%20yesterday)).
    
- **Not a Cure-All / Scope of Application:** Some have pointed out that JTBD, while excellent for understanding demand-side forces, may not address all aspects of innovation. For example, Jobs Theory might not explicitly account for supply-side constraints or breakthroughs – occasionally customers can’t articulate a radical new job because they don’t imagine it possible until a new technology comes along. Also, JTBD primarily informs product/service design and marketing; broader strategic factors (like competitive dynamics unrelated to customer needs, or regulatory shifts) still need consideration beyond the jobs lens. In essence, JTBD should be one tool in a company’s toolkit, not a sole guiding light in every situation.
    

In weighing these critiques, it’s clear that the **effectiveness of JTBD depends on how it’s used**. When applied thoughtfully – with robust research, attention to emotional/social factors, and integration into decision-making – it can greatly improve customer understanding and innovation success. But if applied superficially or rigidly, it can lead to blind spots. Proponents of JTBD have acknowledged many of these challenges and stress proper technique (for example, Moesta and others have published guides on how to conduct effective jobs interviews, cluster findings, etc., to mitigate some difficulties). Likewise, agile practitioners have blended JTBD with existing agile UX methods to address integration concerns. Understanding the limitations helps teams avoid misusing JTBD as a buzzword or panacea, and instead lets them leverage it where it adds the most value: uncovering fresh insights about customer motivations.

## Conclusion

The Jobs to Be Done framework represents a profound shift in how we approach innovation, marketing, and product strategy. By focusing on the _job_ – the progress a customer seeks in a given context – JTBD forces us to look beyond product features or customer stereotypes and see the human needs that drive behavior. Its development through the work of Clayton Christensen, Tony Ulwick, Bob Moesta, and others has given companies a repeatable way to capture the “voice of the customer” at the level that matters most: their desired outcomes and struggles in real-life situations. From famous cases like milkshakes and QuickBooks to countless lesser-known applications, JTBD has helped businesses launch products that resonate more deeply with customers, find new growth opportunities, and avoid the trap of purely technology-centric thinking.

That said, JTBD is not magic – it requires empathy, rigorous research, and sometimes organizational courage to act on its insights. It doesn’t replace the need for sound execution and awareness of market context, but it greatly enhances _what_ you choose to execute by rooting those choices in true customer jobs. As markets continue to evolve and customer expectations rise, the JTBD framework remains highly relevant. It reminds us that amid rapid change, what ultimately succeeds is a solution that nails a job people genuinely need done. In guiding us to that understanding, JTBD offers a powerful compass for innovation – one that, when used wisely, can align a company’s offerings with the very reasons customers will embrace them.
