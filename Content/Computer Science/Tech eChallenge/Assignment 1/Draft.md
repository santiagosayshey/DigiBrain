# Part 1: Understanding the JTBD Framework

**Introduction**
Despite collecting vast amounts of customer data, companies often struggle with product innovation. The culprit? An over-reliance on demographic research that reveals *who* buys products but fails to uncover *why* purchases occur. Clayton Christensen, innovation expert and author of "Competing Against Luck," observed that companies "know more about their customers than ever, yet innovation success remains hit-or-miss" (Christensen et al., 2016).

The Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework addresses this gap by shifting focus from customer attributes to customer objectives. Rather than asking "What kind of person would buy this product?" JTBD asks "What job is the customer trying to accomplish?". This perspective recognises that customers essentially "hire" products and services to help them make progress or solve problems in specific situations (HBS Online, 2020). When a product performs this job well, customers rehire it; when it performs poorly, they "fire" it and look for alternatives (Christensen et al., 2016).

**History**
The JTBD framework can be traced back to Harvard professor Theodore Levitt's famous observation: "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!" (Strategyn, n.d.). This insight shifted focus from products to outcomes, laying groundwork for future innovation thinking. Two pioneers formalised this concept into today's framework: Tony Ulwick, who applied jobs-focused approaches at Cordis Corporation in the early 1990s and published the first JTBD book "What Customers Want" (2005); and Clayton Christensen, whose "Marketing Malpractice" (2005) article and subsequent book "Competing Against Luck" (2016) established Jobs Theory as a cornerstone of innovation thinking (Ulwick, 2020). Their work transformed a simple insight into a powerful framework that consistently uncovers why customers make purchase decisions.

**Defining JTBD**
In JTBD, a "job" is defined as "a statement that describes, with precision, what people are trying to accomplish in a given situation" (Ulwick, 2020). Each job encompasses three dimensions:

- **Functional** (the practical objectives that need to be accomplished - what literally needs to get done)
- **Emotional** (how customers want to feel or avoid feeling during the process, such as confidence, satisfaction, or avoiding frustration)
- **Social** (how customers want to be perceived by others, including considerations of status, identity, and competence)

Understanding these three dimensions allows companies to see beyond surface-level customer attributes and focus on underlying motivations. This is why JTBD moves past traditional demographic segmentation - it identifies why products are hired regardless of who does the hiring.

For example, a 24-year-old marketing associate working long hours and a 60-year-old retiree with mobility challenges might both hire the same meal delivery service. Despite their demographic differences, they share the job of "having a convenient, high-quality meal without the burden of shopping, preparation, and cleanup." Demographic profiles fail to predict this purchasing behaviour because the causal mechanism is the job itself, not customer attributes.

**Real World Examples**
This principle has proven powerful when applied in business settings. Christensen's famous "milkshake morning" case study illustrates how identifying the true job transforms product development. A fast-food chain discovered that many customers purchased milkshakes early in the morning, consuming them alone during their commutes. These customers weren't hiring the milkshake for taste or nutrition, but to make a long, boring drive more bearable while staying full until lunch. The thick, viscous texture allowed it to last throughout the commute and was easier to consume while driving than alternatives like bagels (too crumbly) or bananas (consumed too quickly). Once the company understood this job, they focused on making shakes thicker and speeding up the purchase process; improvements that directly addressed the job requirements rather than demographic preferences (HBS Working Knowledge, 2006).

Similarly, Intuit's QuickBooks emerged from recognising that small-business owners didn't want to become accountants; they simply wanted their "books done" with minimal effort. This insight led Intuit to develop a product with deliberately less functionality than competitors but in a simpler package that better accomplished the core job. QuickBooks quickly captured the majority of its market because it addressed what customers truly needed rather than offering feature parity with competitors (Strategy+Business, 2016).

**Future Innovation**
The success stories of the milkshake and QuickBooks demonstrate how understanding jobs transforms existing products, but JTBD's greater value lies in guiding future innovation and strategy. When companies define their markets by the jobs customers need done rather than by product categories, they gain a huge advantage. Instead of seeing themselves as "milkshake makers" or "software developers," they recognise their true role in fulfilling fundamental customer needs that remain stable even as technologies evolve. This perspective helps businesses identify adjacent innovation opportunities; a photography company might expand from cameras to cloud storage solutions once they define their market as "preserving memories" rather than "selling cameras." As emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and automation continue advancing, JTBD provides a framework for evaluating their potential: not by asking "How can we use this new technology?" but rather "Which customer jobs could this technology help accomplish more effectively?" This approach ensures innovation efforts remain grounded in actual customer needs rather than chasing technological trends, leading to higher success rates for new products and services while protecting against disruption from unexpected competitors (Strategy+Business, 2016).

**Conclusion**
The Jobs to Be Done framework transforms how businesses understand customer behaviour by focusing on the causal drivers behind purchases rather than demographic correlations. Moving from "who buys" to "why they buy" provides clarity that demographic data alone cannot deliver, enabling more precise product development and strategic positioning. When companies align their innovations with the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of customer jobs, they create solutions that resonate regardless of demographic boundaries.

# Part 2: Applying JTBD to a Real-World example

**Introduction** 
Coffee stands as one of the most widely consumed beverages, with a market valued at approximately $100 billion (Coffee Market Size, 2024). Coffee's universal appeal makes it an ideal candidate for a JTBD analysis, revealing why consumers "hire" coffee.

**Jobs and Goals:**
Coffee fulfils multiple customer needs that can be categorised across functional, emotional, and social dimensions.
