# Part 2: Applying JTBD to a Real-World example

**Introduction** 
Coffee stands as one of the world's most widely consumed beverages, with a global market valued at approximately $100 billion in 2024 (Coffee Market Size, 2024). This caffeinated drink serves diverse consumer segments from students and professionals to parents and athletes across varied cultural contexts. Coffee's universal appeal makes it an ideal candidate for Jobs-to-Be-Done analysis, which reveals why consumers "hire" coffee. By understanding the functional tasks coffee helps accomplish, emotional experiences it provides, and social roles it plays, we gain insight into its popularity despite numerous alternatives entering the market (Caffeine Use and Attentional Engagement, 2024).
