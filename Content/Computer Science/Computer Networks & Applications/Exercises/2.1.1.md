> Assume the IP address of the web server is now cached at the client, so no network traffic relating to DNS is required in answering the following. Furthermore, assume the client is downloading an **HTML resource** containing **three images**, each referring to a small image. Lastly, assume transmission times for each of the four web resources are insignificant in comparison to the round-trip time (RTT) between client and server. How many RTTs does it take after the IP address of the server has been cached at the client until when the HTML resource and all three images are received, in each of the following cases (be sure to explain how you arrive at your answer in each case):
> - The browser and server are interacting using HTTP 1.0.
> - The browser and server are interacting using HTTP 1.1 without pipelining.
> - The browser and server are interacting using HTTP 1.1 with pipelining.
>
