> [!exercise]+ DNS Iterative Example - Contacted server replies with the name of the server to contact: "I don't know, but ask this server instead!"
> Follow the steps of the DNS resolution process as a host seeks to resolve an IP address for a given domain. 
>
> | Step | Action |
> |------|--------|
> | 1    | The host at `cis.poly.edu` wants to find the IP address for `gaia.cs.umass.edu`. It contacts the local organisation DNS server `dns.poly.edu`. |
> | 2    | The local organisation DNS server does not have the IP address in its cache, so it queries the root DNS server. |
> | 3    | The root DNS server doesn't know the IP address either, but it knows where to direct queries for `.edu` domains. It tells the local DNS server to query the  `.edu` TLD DNS server by returning it's name server and A type (IP) |
> | 4    | The local DNS server then sends a query to the `.edu` TLD DNS server. |
> | 5    | The `.edu` TLD DNS server does not have the IP address but knows the authoritative DNS server for the domain `umass.edu`. It directs the local DNS server to `dns.cs.umass.edu` by returning it's name server and A type (IP) |
> | 6    | The local DNS server queries the authoritative DNS server at `dns.cs.umass.edu`. |
> | 7    | The authoritative DNS server knows the IP address for `gaia.cs.umass.edu` and sends this information back to the local DNS server. |
> | 8    | The local DNS server now has the IP address and provides it to the host at `cis.poly.edu`, completing the resolution process. |
>
> This example outlines the iterative approach to DNS resolution, demonstrating how queries ascend the DNS hierarchy to find the appropriate authoritative server that can resolve the domain name to its corresponding IP address.
