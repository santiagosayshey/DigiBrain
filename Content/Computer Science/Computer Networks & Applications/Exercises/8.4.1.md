> You have a network `115.64.4.0/22` that you want to create subnets on. The subnets need to support up to 60 hosts each. How many bits would you allocate for the host part of the subnets? How many such subnets can you support? 
> 
> **Answer:**
> We need to assign 60 hosts + 2 (broadcast and network) per subnet. So we need 6 total bits to do this: $2^6 = 64$. Since the network portion of the address takes 22 bits, we are left with 4 bits for the subnet portion. $2^4=16$ total subnets.
