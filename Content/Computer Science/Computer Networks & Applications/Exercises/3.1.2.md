> [!exercise]+ DNS Recursive Example
> Explore the steps of a recursive DNS query as a host attempts to resolve an IP address:
>
> | Step | Action |
> |------|--------|
> | 1    | The host at `cis.poly.edu` requests the IP address for `gaia.cs.umass.edu` from its local DNS server `dns.poly.edu`. |
> | 2    | The local DNS server, which does not have the record in its cache, sends a recursive query to the root DNS server. |
> | 3    | The root DNS server refers the local DNS server to the TLD DNS server responsible for `.edu` domains. |
> | 4    | The local DNS server then sends the query to the `.edu` TLD DNS server. |
> | 5    | The TLD server refers the local DNS server to the authoritative DNS server for `umass.edu`, found at `dns.cs.umass.edu`. |
> | 6    | The local DNS server sends the query to the authoritative DNS server `dns.cs.umass.edu`. |
> | 7    | The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address for `gaia.cs.umass.edu`. |
> | 8    | The local DNS server finally responds to the host at `cis.poly.edu` with the IP address, completing the process. |
>
> A recursive DNS query simplifies the process for the requesting host, placing the burden of resolving the domain name entirely on the DNS servers. This method can potentially put a heavy load on the upper levels of the DNS hierarchy if many such recursive requests are made.
