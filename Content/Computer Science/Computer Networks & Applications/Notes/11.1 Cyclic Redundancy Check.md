>
> As data is transmitted over computer networks, errors can occur due to various factors such as noise or interference. While simple parity bits and checksums can detect isolated bit errors, **they struggle to effectively handle burst errors, where multiple consecutive bits are corrupted**. This limitation **motivates the need for more robust error detection techniques like the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** to ensure reliable data transmission.

> [!idea] Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
> 
> The Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a powerful error detection technique used in data communications and storage systems. It is based on **representing binary data as polynomials and performing arithmetic operations on these polynomials over a specific finite field** or Galois Field (GF).
> 
> The CRC calculation involves the following key steps:
> 
> 1. Represent the binary data as a polynomial, treating each bit as a coefficient.
> 2. Append zeros to the right of the binary data, where the number of zeros equals the degree of a predefined generator polynomial.
> 3. Divide the extended data polynomial by the generator polynomial using polynomial long division.
> 4. The remainder obtained from the division is the CRC checksum.
> 5. Append the CRC checksum to the original data for transmission.

>
> Consider the binary data `10011010` and the generator polynomial $1101 = x^3 + x^2 + 1$
>
> Step 1: Represent the binary data as a polynomial.
> $10011010 = x^7 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1$
>
> Step 2: Append zeros to the right of the binary data, where the number of zeros equals the degree of the generator polynomial (3).
> $10011010000 = x^{10} + x^7 + x^6 + x^4$
>
> Step 3: Divide the extended data polynomial by the generator polynomial using polynomial long division (modulo 2, without carry).

> CRC checksum: $x^2 + 1 = 101$ (binary)
>
> Step 5: Append the CRC checksum to the original data for transmission.
> Transmitted data: `10011010` + `101` = `10011010101`
> 
> **Receiever's Side**
> 
> Step 6: Receive the transmitted data `10011010101`.
>
> Step 7: Divide the entire received data by the same generator polynomial used for CRC generation ($x^3 + x^2 + 1$).
>
> Step 8: Perform polynomial long division (modulo 2, without carry) on the received data.
>
> Step 9: Check the remainder. If the remainder is zero, the data is considered to be error-free. If the remainder is non-zero, an error occurred during transmission.

> [!consider] Error Detection Capabilities and Limitations
> 
> CRC provides strong error detection capabilities, especially for burst errors. The choice of the generator polynomial greatly influences the types of errors that can be detected. Some key considerations include:
> 
> - CRC can detect all single-bit and double-bit errors.
> - CRC can detect all odd number of bit errors.
> - The error detection capability for burst errors depends on the degree of the generator polynomial. A CRC-n can detect any burst error up to n bits long.
> 
> However, CRC has limitations. It cannot detect errors that are exact multiples of the generator polynomial. Additionally, CRC alone cannot correct errors; it only detects them. Error correction requires additional techniques like forward error correction (FEC).
