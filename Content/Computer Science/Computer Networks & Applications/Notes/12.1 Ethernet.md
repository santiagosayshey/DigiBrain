> [!motivation] The Need for Ethernet
> In the early days of networking, the BUS topology, developed by Metcalfe, was a common approach. However, as network speeds increased, reaching 10Gbps and beyond, the limitations of this topology became evident.
> 
![[busBackbone.jpg]] 
> 
> - The **BUS topology struggled to efficiently handle high-speed data transmission**
> - Collisions and data loss became more frequent as network traffic increased
> - A new solution was needed to ensure reliable and efficient communication in modern networks


> [!idea] Ethernet: A Standardized Network Communication Protocol
> Ethernet is a standardized communication protocol that **defines how network devices transmit data over a wired network**.
> - Enables devices to communicate with each other using a common language
> - Specifies the format and structure of data packets, known as Ethernet frames
> 
> ![[Ethernet Frame.png]]
> 
> - Key components of an Ethernet frame:
>   - Preamble: A sequence of alternating 1s and 0s that synchronizes the receiving device's clock
>   - Start Frame Delimiter (SFD): Indicates the start of the frame
>   - Destination and source MAC addresses
>   - EtherType field indicating the protocol being transported ( like how we use port number to tell where to send TCP / UDP packets)
>   - Payload containing the actual data being transmitted
>   - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection
> - Ethernet operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model

> [!example] The Preamble in Action
> Consider an Ethernet device receiving a signal from another device:
> - The preamble consists of a sequence of alternating 1s and 0s (10101010...)
> - The receiving device **uses a clock recovery circuit to synchronize its clock with the incoming signal**
>   - The alternating pattern **allows the device to determine the timing of individual bits**
>   - The device adjusts its clock to sample the incoming signal at the correct intervals
> - Once synchronized, the device can accurately identify the start of the frame
>   - The preamble is followed by the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), which indicates the beginning of the frame content
>   - The SFD is a specific pattern (10101011) that the device recognizes as the start of the frame
> 
> By using the preamble to synchronize its clock and the SFD to identify the start of the frame, the receiving device can correctly interpret the incoming data and avoid misalignment or misinterpretation.

> [!idea] The Evolution from Bus to Star Topology
> As Ethernet networks evolved to support higher speeds and more devices, the **star topology emerged as a superior alternative to the bus topology**.
> 
> In a star topology, **each device is connected to a central active switch or hub**, creating a point-to-point connection between the device and the switch.
> 
> ![[Some-Networks-Implement-a-Local-Ring-Topology-A-star-topology-is-a-LAN-architecture-in.jpg]]
> 
> Advantages of the star topology over the bus topology:
> - **Reduced collision domain**: Each device has a dedicated connection to the switch, minimizing the chances of collisions
> - Improved reliability: **If one device or cable fails, it doesn't affect the entire network**
> - Easier troubleshooting: Problems can be isolated to a specific device or connection
> - Increased bandwidth: Devices can communicate simultaneously without sharing the total available bandwidth
> 
> The active switch plays a crucial role in the star topology:
> - It intelligently forwards data packets to the intended recipients based on MAC addresses
> - Buffers incoming data to manage network congestion
> - Provides full-duplex communication, allowing devices to send and receive data simultaneously
