> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the backbone of the internet's naming system, enabling a user-friendly way of locating websites and services through domain names rather than numerical IP addresses. It's a decentralized database that allows seamless changes and updates within an organization without the need for a central authority. By translating domain names to IP addresses, DNS servers facilitate the connection between users and the websites they wish to visit, operating on UDP/TCP port 53.


> [!consider] How easy is it to remember phone numbers?
> IP addresses can be analogized to the process of remembering phone numbers and names. Just as people often find it easier to remember names rather than a string of numbers, DNS serves as the internet's phone book, translating human-friendly domain names (like "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)") into numerical IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network

| Level | Server Type                    | Function                                                           | Example                                                                                                                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Root Name Server               | Directs queries to specific TLD servers                            | 13 worldwide, does not store all domain info. Is able to resolve all queries or identify another intermediate name server |
| 2     | Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers | Manages top-level domains like .com, .org, .edu and country codes  | Network Solutions for .com, Educause for .edu                                                                             |
| 3     | Authoritative DNS Servers      | Provides authoritative hostname to IP address mappings for domains | An organization's own DNS servers for its domain, like yahoo.com DNS servers                                              |
| 4     | Local Name Server              | Caches DNS query results and handles local DNS requests            | Your ISP's DNS server, must know at least one root server                                                                 |


> [!idea] DNS Record Storage and Insertion
> The Domain Name System (DNS) is structured like a distributed database storing various types of resource records (RRs). These records are used to translate human-friendly domain names into IP addresses and vice versa, as well as to define other aspects of domain behavior.
> 
> **RR format**: `(name, value, type, ttl)`
> 
> **Types of DNS Records**:
> - **Type A**: Associates a hostname with its corresponding IPv4 address.
> - **Type NS**: Indicates the authoritative name server for the domain.
> - **Type CNAME**: Defines an alias for a domain, pointing to the canonical name.
> - **Type MX**: Specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email on behalf of the domain.
> 
> **Inserting Records into DNS**:
> When registering a domain, such as for a new startup, you'll interact with a registrar to insert necessary RRs into the DNS. For example, a startup named "Network Utopia" would:
> - Register `networkutopia.com` with a registrar like Network Solutions.
> - Provide the registrar with names and IP addresses of authoritative name servers.
> - The registrar inserts NS and A records into the .com TLD server for domain resolution.
> 	- `networktopia.com, dns1.networkutopia.com, NS`
> 	- `dns1.networkutopia.com, 212.212.212.1, A`
> - Additional records like Type A for `www.networkutopia.com` and Type MX for email services are also added to authoritative servers, e.g. `mail.networkutopia.com`
