> [!motivation] The Age of the Internet
> 
> As the internet expanded, the limitations of IPv4 became increasingly apparent. The most pressing issue was the **exhaustion of address space**. Particularly, the **depletion of Class B addresses** highlighted a critical need for a more extensive addressing scheme to support the growing number of internet-connected devices.
> 
> - **Classful Addressing Limitations**: The fixed boundaries between network and host portions in classful addressing (Classes A, B, and C) led to inefficient IP address distribution.
> - **Rapid Growth**: The explosion in the number of devices and internet usage worldwide necessitated a larger pool of IP addresses.
> - **Future Proofing**: With the advent of IoT and smart devices, a scalable and more flexible addressing model was needed to future-proof the infrastructure.
 
> [!idea] IPv6 Addressing
> 
> IPv6 addresses use  a vastly larger address space to address this demand and improve the efficiency of routing.
> 
> - **128-bit Addressing**: Unlike IPv4's 32-bit system, IPv6 uses 128 bits, exponentially increasing the total number of possible addresses. Roughly **1000 addresses per square metre**.
> - **Hexadecimal Representation**: IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal, separated by colons, for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. 
> - **Simplified Routing**: The larger address space allows for a hierarchical structure that simplifies routing and network management.
> - **Improved Auto-configuration**: IPv6 includes features like stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), which simplifies network configurations by allowing devices to generate their own addresses.
> - **Less overhead:** 8 header sections vs 13 for IPv4.

> [!consider] IPv6 Address Hexadecimal Representation
>
> In the hexadecimal representation of IPv6 addresses, each address is divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons. Each group represents 16 bits (two bytes) of the 128-bit address.
>
> - **Hexadecimal Digits**: The hexadecimal number system uses 16 digits: 0-9 and A-F (or a-f), where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on.
> - **Leading Zeroes**: Leading zeroes in a group can be omitted. For example, `0042` can be written as `42`.
> - **Consecutive Zeroes**: Any consecutive groups of zeroes can be represented by a double colon (`::`). However, this can only be used **once** in an address to avoid ambiguity about the position and number of omitted groups.


> [!example] Examples of IPv6 Representation
>
> **Good Examples**:
>
> - `1080:0:0:0:0:9:800:200C:417A` is the same as `1080::9:800:200C:417A` (using `::` for 5 consecutive groups of zeroes)
> - `FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:43` is the same as `FF01::43` (using `::` for 6 consecutive groups of zeroes)
>
> **Bad Examples**:
>
> - `1080::9::800:200C:417A` (using `::` twice, which is ambiguous)
> - `FF01::0:0:43` (using `::` for non-consecutive zeroes, which is invalid)
>
> When using the double colon (`::`) to omit consecutive groups of zeroes, the number of omitted groups can be determined by counting the remaining groups and subtracting that from 8 (the total number of groups in an IPv6 address).
>
> By using the hexadecimal representation, IPv6 addresses can be written more compactly compared to their binary form, making them easier to read and manage.

> [!idea] Differences in IPv6 Routing
>
> IPv6 routing introduces some differences compared to IPv4:
>
> 1. **Interface Addressing**: Each interface can have multiple addresses assigned to it, whereas in IPv4 an interface typically had a single address.
>
> 2. **Address Types**: IPv6 introduces new address types beyond the traditional unicast addresses:
>    - **Unicast**: Identifies a single interface, similar to IPv4.
>    - **Anycast**: Identifies a set of interfaces, and the packet is delivered to the nearest one (e.g., nearest host).
>    - **Multicast**: Identifies a set of interfaces, and the packet is delivered to all of them.
>
> 3. **Hierarchical Routing**: IPv6 addressing is designed to support hierarchical routing, where prefixes in the address identify registries, providers, etc. This facilitates efficient routing and network management.
>
> 4. **Address Structure**: IPv6 addresses can have a hierarchical structure with different sections representing subscriber prefixes, area IDs, subnet IDs, and interface IDs, as shown in the example: `128-s-n-m` (subscriber prefix, area id, subnet id, interface id).
>
> 5. **Global and Geographic Addressing**: IPv6 allows for global provider-based unicast addresses and geographic-based unicast addresses, enabling more flexibility in address allocation and routing.
>
> The introduction of new address types like anycast and multicast, along with the hierarchical structure and support for global and geographic addressing, aims to simplify routing, improve network management, and provide more efficient address allocation in IPv6 compared to IPv4.

> [!consider] Optional IPv6 Extension Headers
>
> IPv6 supports optional extension headers for added functionality:
>
> | Extension Header | Purpose |
> |-------------------|----------|
> | Hop-by-Hop Options | Carries optional router-specific information, enabling IPsec, QoS treatment. |
> | Routing | Specifies full or partial packet route, useful for mobile IPv6 and policy routing. |
> | Fragment | Handles packet fragmentation and reassembly at source and destination. |
> | Authentication Header (AH) | Ensures payload authenticity, integrity, and sender verification. |
> | Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) | Provides payload confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and anti-replay protection. |
> | Destination Options | Carries optional destination-specific information. |
>
> Headers specify type, length, and router response (ignore, skip, report error) if unprocessable.


> [!consider] IPv6 Fragmentation
>
> IPv6 fragmentation occurs only at the source node; routers cannot fragment packets.
>
> **At Source**:
> - Fragments oversized packets exceeding Path MTU into smaller fragments.
> - Encapsulates fragments with Fragment Extension Header for reassembly.
>
> **Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)**:
> - Determines smallest MTU along the path to destination.
> - Allows source to adjust packet size and avoid fragmentation when possible.
>
> **At Destination**:
> - Reassembles original packet from fragments using Fragment Header.
> - Discards entire packet if any fragment is missing or corrupted.
>
> This approach simplifies router operations, avoids fragmentation complexities, and ensures efficient end-to-end packet transmission and reassembly.


> [!consider] IPv4 to IPv6 Transition
>
> The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is a gradual process where both protocols will coexist for an extended period. Several mechanisms facilitate this migration:
>
> **Transition Mechanisms**:
> - Dual-stack: Devices support both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
> - Tunneling: IPv6 packets encapsulated within IPv4 packets to traverse IPv4 networks.
> - Translation: Network Address Translation (NAT) between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
