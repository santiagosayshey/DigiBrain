>
> A LAN is a **computer network that interconnects devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office** or campus. LANs facilitate high-speed data communication, resource sharing, and collaborative work among users and systems within the local environment.

> [!idea] MAC Addresses
> Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interface cards (NICs) and are used by the data link layer for local delivery of frames within a single network segment. Key points include:
> - **48-bit address**: MAC addresses are 48 bits long and represented in hexadecimal notation.
> - **Uniqueness**: MAC addresses are globally unique.
> - **Local scope**: MAC addresses are used for communication within a single network segment. They change at each hop, while IP addresses remain constant.
> - **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses within a LAN.
> 
> MAC addressing is crucial for reliable and efficient communication between devices on a local network.

> [!consider] MAC Address Allocation
>
> MAC addresses are **uniquely allocated to network interfaces to ensure global uniqueness across all devices and manufacturers.** This allocation process follows a hierarchical approach:
>
> - The IEEE assigns a unique Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) range to each manufacturer
> - The manufacturer then assigns a unique identifier from their allocated OUI range to each network interface they produce
>
> This two-step process is analogous to how tax file numbers are allocated:
>
> - A governing authority assigns a unique numbering range to each employer/entity
> - The employer then assigns a unique number from that range to each individual
>
> Just as a **tax file number uniquely identifies an individual, a MAC address uniquely identifies a network interface, even if it connects to different networks**. A single device can have multiple network interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular), each with its own unique MAC address.
>
> By following this hierarchical allocation method, with the IEEE managing the OUI assignments and manufacturers managing the unique identifiers, MAC addresses maintain global uniqueness across all devices and manufacturers, enabling accurate data frame delivery on networks.

> [!example] Sending a Packet Between Two LANs
> Consider sending a packet from 192.168.1.10 in LAN A to 192.168.2.20 in LAN B through a router:
> 1. 192.168.1.10 encapsulates the packet in a frame with the router's MAC address on LAN A as the destination and its own as the source. IP addresses remain constant.
> 2. The frame is sent over LAN A to the router.
> 3. The router de-encapsulates the frame and looks up the next hop for 192.168.2.20.
> 4. The router encapsulates the packet in a new frame with the next hop's MAC address on LAN B as the destination and its own as the source. IP addresses remain unchanged.
> 5. The new frame is sent over LAN B, and the process continues until it reaches 192.168.2.20.
> 
> This shows how **IP addresses remain constant, while MAC addresses change based on the network segment**.
