> [!motivation] Secure Communication Via Email
>
> Email has become an essential communication tool in personal and professional domains, **enabling the exchange of information** globally. However, the open nature of email systems and the Internet poses several security risks:
>
> - Confidentiality: **Unencrypted email messages can be intercepted** and read by unauthorized parties during transmission or storage.
> - Authentication: Without proper authentication mechanisms, it is **difficult to verify the true identity of the sender**, making email vulnerable to spoofing and impersonation attacks.
> - Message Integrity: **Unprotected email messages can be altered** or tampered with during transit, compromising the integrity of the information.
> - Access and Availability: **Email servers and systems can be targeted by denial-of-service** attacks, disrupting the availability of communication channels.
>
> Addressing these security concerns is crucial to ensure the privacy, authenticity, and reliability of email communication.

> [!idea] Cryptography for Secure Email
>
> Cryptography provides a set of **techniques and principles that address the security concern**s outlined in the motivation callout, enabling secure email communication:
> 
> Key cryptographic terminology:
> - **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key.
> - **Decryption**: The reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate decryption key.
> - **Symmetric Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms that use the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.
> - **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms that use a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
> - **Digital Signature**: A cryptographic mechanism that uses asymmetric cryptography to provide authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

> [!consider] Public Algorithms, Private Keys
>
> In cryptographic systems, a widely accepted principle is to use **publicly available algorithms while keeping the keys private**. 
>
> - Cryptographic algorithms are publicly available for review and analysis by the security community
> - This promotes transparency and allows scrutiny to increase confidence in the algorithms' robustness
> - Security relies on keeping the encryption/decryption keys private, not secrecy of the algorithm itself
> - Public algorithms enable interoperability across different systems and implementations
>
> - Keeping keys private is generally easier to achieve than attempting to keep the entire algorithm secret
> - Secrecy of the algorithm alone is considered a weak practice, known as "security through obscurity"

> [!example] Applying Cryptography to Secure Email
>
> To secure email communication using cryptography, the following steps can be taken:
>
> 1. **Encryption**: Alice encrypts her email message using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., a block or stream cipher) and a randomly generated session key.
> 2. **Key Exchange**: Alice encrypts the session key using Bob's public key (asymmetric cryptography) and includes it with the encrypted message.
> 3. **Digital Signature**: Alice creates a digital signature of the encrypted message and the encrypted session key using her private key.
> 4. **Email Transmission**: Alice sends the encrypted message, encrypted session key, and digital signature to Bob.
> 5. **Verification and Decryption**: Bob uses Alice's public key to verify the digital signature, ensuring the message's integrity and authenticity. He then uses his private key to decrypt the session key, and finally, the session key to decrypt the message.

> | Encryption Method  | Description | Application Process | How to Break |
> |-------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
> | Block Cipher      | A symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts data in fixed-size blocks using the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. | Alice encrypts her email message block by block using the session key. Bob decrypts each block using the same session key. | Typically vulnerable to attacks such as brute force, differential cryptanalysis, and linear cryptanalysis. |
> | Stream Cipher     | A symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts data as a continuous stream, suitable for high-speed applications and parallelization. | Alice encrypts her email message by XORing each bit/byte of the message with a pseudorandom key stream generated from the session key. Bob decrypts the message by XORing the encrypted stream with the same pseudorandom key stream. | Vulnerable to attacks such as key reuse attacks, correlation attacks, and distinguishing attacks. |
> | Substitution Cipher | A symmetric encryption algorithm that substitutes each letter or symbol in the plaintext with another letter or symbol according to a fixed system. | Alice encrypts her email message by substituting each letter with another letter according to a predefined substitution system. Bob decrypts the message by reversing the substitution process. | Vulnerable to frequency analysis and pattern analysis, making it relatively easy to break with sufficient ciphertext. |
>
> This approach ensures the confidentiality of the email message (through encryption), authentication of the sender (through digital signatures), and message integrity (through digital signatures and hash functions).

> [!consider] Secure Key Exchange for Symmetric Ciphers
**The Problem**
>
> - **Symmetric Encryption**: Relies on both the sender and receiver having access to the same secret key.
> - **Key Distribution**: The challenge is to distribute the secret key securely over an insecure communication channel.
>
> **Solutions**
>
> - **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: 
>   - Allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
>   - Both parties agree on a large prime number and a base, then exchange computed values derived from their private keys.
>   - Each party uses their private key and the received value to compute the shared secret.
> - **RSA Encryption**:
>   - Uses asymmetric cryptography for secure key exchange.
>   - The sender encrypts the symmetric key with the recipient's public key, and the recipient decrypts it with their private key.
> - **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**:
>   - An extension of the Diffie-Hellman protocol using elliptic curve cryptography for greater security with smaller key sizes.
> - **Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)**:
>   - Keys are exchanged in advance through a secure channel, such as in-person or over an encrypted connection.
>   - Suitable for environments where a secure key exchange mechanism cannot be established dynamically.

> [!example] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
>
> The Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol can be illustrated using a paint-mixing analogy. Here’s how it works:
>
> 1. **Agree on Common Paint Color**:
>    - Alice and Bob agree on a common base color of paint, say yellow.
>
> 2. **Choose Secret Colors**:
>    - Alice chooses a secret color, say red.
>    - Bob chooses a secret color, say blue.
>
> 3. **Mix Secret Colors with Common Color**:
>    - Alice mixes her secret red paint with the common yellow paint, creating a unique mixture (orange).
>    - Bob mixes his secret blue paint with the common yellow paint, creating a different unique mixture (green).
>
> 4. **Exchange Mixed Colors**:
>    - Alice sends her orange paint mixture to Bob.
>    - Bob sends his green paint mixture to Alice.
>
> 5. **Mix Again with Secret Colors**:
>    - Alice takes the green paint mixture she received from Bob and mixes it with her secret red paint, creating a final color.
>    - Bob takes the orange paint mixture he received from Alice and mixes it with his secret blue paint, creating the same final color.
>
> Now, both Alice and Bob have created the same final color, which represents their shared secret. Even if someone saw the mixtures being exchanged, they wouldn’t know the secret colors used by Alice and Bob to create the final color.
>
> **Note**: In practice, the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange **relies on exceptionally difficult mathematical problems**, such as the discrete logarithm problem. These problems are considered computationally hard, meaning they cannot be solved efficiently by any known algorithm, thus ensuring the security of the key exchange.
