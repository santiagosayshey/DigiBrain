>
> In classful addressing, the division between the network and host parts of an IP address is **determined by the address class**:
>
> | Class | Network Bits | Host Bits | Address Range                              |
> |-------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------- |
> | A     | 8            | 24        | 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255                 |
> | B     | 16           | 16        | 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255               |
> | C     | 24           | 8         | 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255               |
> | D     | -            | -         | 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)   |
> | E     | -            | -         | 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 (Experimental) |

> For example, if an IP address belongs to Class A, the first 8 bits (the first octet) represent the network part, while the remaining 24 bits (the last three octets) represent the host part.
>
> The University of Adelaide is assigned a Class B IP address, - `129.127.0.0`, allowing for a large number of hosts within the university network. In this case, the first two octets (129.127) represent the network part, and the last two octets (0.0) represent the host part.


> [!example] Network over Time
> Over time, as the internet grew, the most desirable Class B addresses were used up. This led to a practice of assigning multiple Class C addresses to a single network to accommodate more hosts. However, this approach has several drawbacks:
>
> 1. Inefficient use of IP address space: Assigning multiple Class C addresses to a network results in many unused IP addresses, as each Class C network can only accommodate 254 hosts.
>
> 2. Increased routing table size: Each Class C network assigned to a single organization requires a separate entry in the routing tables of internet routers, leading to larger and less efficient routing tables.
>
> 3. Administrative overhead: Managing multiple Class C networks for a single organization can be more complex and time-consuming than managing a single, appropriately sized network.
