> [!idea]+ Three Way Handshake
> TCP Connections are established using a **3-way handshake**.
> - **Request** connection: Sender sends a **SYN** packet. This contains a randomly selected sequence number `x`. 
> - **Grant** connection: Receiver responds with a **SYN/ACK** packet. This contains another randomly selected sequence number `y` as well as an ACK of `x+1` 
> - **Acknowledge** connection: Sender responds with an **ACK** packet. This contains sequence number `x+1` and ACK `y+1`. This ACK packet also contains the data of the HTTP request.
> - <font color="#92d050">Note</font>: The `S` bit in the TCP headers are set to `1` for **SYN** packets

> [!consider]+ Why do we need three messages instead of two?
> **Consider rock climbing**: Person 1 at the top throws a rope down (SYN). Person at the bottom grabs the rope and wiggles it to signal they are ready and can securely hold the rope (SYN/ACK). Then, the person at the top wiggles the rope again to confirm that they are now ready for the climber to start ascending (ACK). This ensures both parties are prepared and secure before the climb (data transfer) begins.
> 
> This three-step process **prevents half-open connections**. For example, if a client sends a SYN but the SYN/ACK response is delayed and times out, the client might resend the SYN, initiating another connection attempt. Without the final ACK, the server might prepare for a connection that the client no longer considers active. This can lead to a proliferation of half-open connections which put significant load on the network, leading to potential **system downtime, wasted resources, and decreased performance.**

> [!consider]+ Why use random sequence numbers in the 3-way handshake?
> Random initial sequence numbers in the TCP handshake **enhance security** by making it **harder** for attackers to **predict** and manipulate sequence numbers. This randomness also **prevents packet collisions** from previous sessions, ensuring that each connection is unique and less prone to errors from old data.
