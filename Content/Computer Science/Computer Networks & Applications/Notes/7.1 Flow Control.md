> [!idea]+ TCP Flow Control
> TCP flow control is a mechanism that ensures data is transferred between sender and receiver at a pace that both can handle efficiently. It exists to **prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver's buffer** by sending data faster than it can be processed. 
> 
> Flow control is managed using the **window size** in the TCP header, which **indicates how much more data the receiver can accept.** The sender can send more data as long as the window size is greater than zero.

> [!consider]+ How does the sender know when it can send more data?
> TCP allows the sender to periodically **send a probeâ€”an empty packet**. This probe forces the receiver to **respond with the current window size**, informing the sender whether it can resume sending data.
