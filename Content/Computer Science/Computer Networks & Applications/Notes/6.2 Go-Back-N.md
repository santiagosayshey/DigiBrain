> Go-Back-N is a pipelining protocol where the sender can transmit multiple packets (up to a window size) without waiting for an acknowledgment, but the receiver only sends cumulative acknowledgments.

> | - Receiver discards packet 4 (and any other packets sent) and sends ACK 2 | - Everything continues as normal because the final ACK of the window is receieved                        |
> | - Sender retransmits packets 3 and 4 upon receiving ACK 2                 |   - Sender transmits packets 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 upon receiving ACK 5                       |

> Key points:
> - Sender maintains a window of size N
> - Receiver sends cumulative ACKs for in-order packets
> - **When a packet is lost or corrupted, the receiver discards all subsequent packets, even if they are received correctly**. 
> 	- Eg: Packet 1,2,3 is received. 4 is lost. 5,6,7 are received but discarded. 
> - Sender retransmits all packets starting from the lost one
> - **The sender only needs a single cumulative ACK to acknowledge an entire window of packets, as long as all packets in that window have been received successfully**
> - When we receive an ACK, we can shift the window size by 1
> - Since we are transmitting data back form a set point (and not just missing packets), this can lead to large amounts of data being resent for no reason when the window size is quite big
