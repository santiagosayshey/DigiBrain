> [!idea] ALOHA
>
> ALOHA is a simple random access protocol where nodes can transmit data over a shared channel whenever they have data to send, with the possibility for collisions. 

> [!example] Collision Detection and Recovery
> To illustrate how ALOHA handles collisions, consider the following scenario with three nodes: Node A, Node B, and Node C.
>
> 1. **Node A starts transmitting data**
>    - Node A begins sending a data packet over the shared channel.
>    - While transmitting, Node A continuously monitors the channel to detect any collisions.
>
> 2. **Node B also starts transmitting, causing a collision**
>    - Shortly after Node A starts transmitting, Node B also attempts to send a data packet over the same channel.
>    - The signals from Node A and Node B overlap, resulting in a collision on the shared channel.
>
> 3. **Nodes A and B detect the collision**
>    - Both Node A and Node B detect the collision by comparing the signal they are transmitting with the signal they are receiving from the channel.
>    - Since the received signal differs from the transmitted signal, they realize a collision has occurred.
>
> 4. **Nodes A and B generate jam signals**
>    - Upon detecting the collision, both Node A and Node B generate and transmit a jam signal over the channel.
>    - The jam signal is a predefined signal that notifies all nodes that a collision has occurred.
>
> 5. **Node C detects the jam signal**
>    - Node C, which was not initially transmitting, detects the jam signal on the channel.
>    - This indicates to Node C that a collision has occurred, and it should refrain from transmitting until the channel is clear.
>
> 6. **Nodes A and B initiate the backoff procedure**
>    - After transmitting the jam signal, Node A and Node B each wait for a random amount of time (backoff period) before attempting to retransmit their data packets.
>    - The random backoff period helps reduce the probability of another collision during the next transmission attempt.
>
> 7. **Nodes A and B retransmit their data packets**
>    - After the backoff period, Node A and Node B retransmit their respective data packets one at a time, assuming no other node has started transmitting in the meantime.
>    - If another collision occurs, the process repeats from step 3.
>

> [!consider] Regular ALOHA vs. Slotted ALOHA
>
> **Regular ALOHA**:
> - Nodes can transmit data at any time, without any coordination or time synchronization.
> - This simplicity comes at the cost of a higher probability of collisions, especially in networks with higher traffic loads.
> - Collisions can occur when two or more nodes transmit simultaneously, even if their transmissions are partially overlapping.
> - The maximum theoretical channel utilization for regular ALOHA is approximately 18%.
>
> **Slotted ALOHA**:
> - Time is divided into discrete slots, and nodes can only transmit at the beginning of each slot.
> - Nodes are synchronized, so they all start transmitting at the same time within each slot.
> - Collisions can only occur if two or more nodes transmit in the same slot. Partial overlaps are avoided.
> - The maximum theoretical channel utilization for Slotted ALOHA is approximately 37%, almost double that of regular ALOHA.
> - However, Slotted ALOHA requires time synchronization among all nodes, which adds complexity.
>
> In both regular ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA, nodes monitor the channel during transmission to detect collisions and use a backoff procedure with random waiting times to recover from collisions and retransmit their data.
>
> While regular ALOHA is simpler and requires no synchronization, Slotted ALOHA can achieve higher channel utilization by reducing the probability of collisions. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the network, such as the level of traffic, the need for synchronization, and the acceptable level of collisions and retransmissions.

> [!idea] Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
> 
> CSMA is a media access control protocol that allows multiple nodes to efficiently share a common transmission medium. Nodes **listen to the channel before transmitting to avoid collision**s. If the channel is busy, the node defers transmission until it becomes idle.

> [!consider] CSMA vs. ALOHA
>
> - CSMA uses carrier sensing, while ALOHA allows nodes to transmit without checking the channel state.
> - CSMA has a lower collision probability and higher channel utilization compared to ALOHA.
> - CSMA is more complex, requiring nodes to sense the channel and defer transmission when necessary.

> [!example] CSMA Collision Handling
> 
> **Non-Persistent CSMA:**
>
> 1. Node A senses the channel and finds it busy. It waits for a random backoff period before sensing the channel again.
> 2. After the backoff period, Node A senses the channel again. If the channel is idle, it transmits. If the channel is still busy, it waits for another random backoff period before sensing again.
> 3. This process continues until Node A finds the channel idle and transmits its data.
>
> **Persistent CSMA:**
>
> 1. Node A and Node B sense the channel, find it idle, and start transmitting simultaneously.
> 2. A collision occurs, and both nodes detect it.
> 3. After the collision, Node A and Node B immediately attempt to retransmit their packets with probability p.
> 4. If a node does not retransmit (with probability 1-p), it continuously senses the channel until it becomes idle and then immediately attempts to retransmit with probability p.
> 5. If the retransmission results in another collision, the nodes involved repeat steps 3 and 4.
> 6. This process continues until one of the nodes successfully transmits its packet without collision.

> [!consider] Collisions in CSMA
>
> Can collisions still occur in CSMA? Yes, collisions can occur due to:
>
> 1. **Propagation delay:** The time it takes for a signal to propagate through the medium, during which other nodes may sense the channel as idle and start transmitting, causing collisions.
>
> 2. **Simultaneous sensing:** Multiple nodes sensing the channel simultaneously, finding it idle, and starting to transmit at the same time, leading to collisions, especially when network traffic is high.
>
> Techniques like CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA are used to further mitigate the impact of collisions in CSMA-based networks.


> [!idea] Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
>
> CSMA/CD is a media access control protocol that enhances CSMA by detecting collisions during transmission and taking corrective action. It is widely used in Ethernet networks to improve efficiency and reduce data transmission errors.
> 
> - **Collision Detection:** Nodes monitor the channel during transmission. If a collision is detected, they stop transmitting immediately.
> - **Jam Signal:** After detecting a collision, nodes send a jam signal to notify other nodes of the collision.
> - **Random Backoff:** Nodes wait for a random backoff period before attempting to retransmit, reducing the likelihood of repeated collisions.

> [!consider] CSMA/CD vs. CSMA/CA
>
> - **Collision Handling:** CSMA/CD detects and handles collisions after they occur, while CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance) aims to prevent collisions before they happen.
> - **Application:** CSMA/CD is commonly used in wired Ethernet networks, whereas CSMA/CA is used in wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi) where detecting collisions is more challenging.
> - **Efficiency:** CSMA/CD can be more efficient in environments with low to moderate traffic, but CSMA/CA is better suited for high traffic wireless environments.

> [!consider] Limitations of CSMA/CD
>
> Despite its advantages, CSMA/CD has limitations:
>
> 1. **Propagation Delay:** The time it takes for a signal to travel across the network can lead to collisions if nodes are not aware of each other's transmissions.
> 2. **Network Size:** CSMA/CD is less effective in large networks with long distances between nodes, as the likelihood of collisions increases.
> 3. **High Traffic:** In networks with high traffic, the frequency of collisions and retransmissions can reduce overall network performance.

> [!example] CSMA/CD Collision Handling
>
> **Scenario:**
>
> 1. Node A starts transmitting a packet.
> 2. Node B, unaware of Node A's transmission, also starts transmitting, resulting in a collision.
> 3. Both nodes detect the collision almost immediately.
> 4. Node A and Node B stop transmitting and send a jam signal to ensure all nodes on the network are aware of the collision.
> 5. After sending the jam signal, Node A and Node B wait for a random backoff period before attempting to retransmit.
> 6. Each node senses the channel again before retransmitting, repeating the process if another collision occurs.
