> [!idea] Selective Repeat (SR)
>
> Selective Repeat is a pipelining protocol that allows the sender to transmit multiple packets (up to a window size) without waiting for an acknowledgment, and the receiver individually acknowledges each correctly received packet, even if it is out of order.
>
> | Example 1 | Example 2 |
> |-----------|-----------|
> | - Sender's window size: 4 | - Sender's window size: 5 |
> | - Sent packets: 1, 2, 3, 4 | - Sent packets: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
> | - Received ACKs: 1, 2, 4 | - Received ACKs: 1, 2, 3, 5 |
> | - Packet 3 is lost | - Packet 4 is lost |
> | - Sender times out waiting for ACK 3 | - Sender times out waiting for ACK 4 |
> | - Sender retransmits only packet 3 | - Sender retransmits only packet 4 |
> | - Sender sends packet 5 after receiving ACK 4 | - Sender sends packets 6 and 7 after receiving ACKs 3 and 5 |

> > [!consider] SQ # and Window Size Relationship
> > In Selective Repeat, the range of sequence numbers must be larger than the window size to handle the retransmission of packets from a previous window. If the range of sequence numbers is not large enough, it can lead to ambiguity in identifying whether a received ACK belongs to the original transmission or a retransmission. This is known as the "sliding window protocol" problem.
> >
> > To avoid this issue, the range of sequence numbers should be at least twice the window size (2N for selective repeat) or 1 plus the window size (N + 1 for GBN)  This ensures that there is no overlap between the sequence numbers of the packets in the current window and the sequence numbers of the packets in the previous window that might be retransmitted.
> >
> > For example, if the window size is 4, the range of sequence numbers should be at least 8 (2 Ã— 4) to handle retransmissions correctly.

> Key points:
> - Sender maintains a window of size N
> - Receiver sends individual ACKs for each correctly received packet
> - Lost or corrupted packets cause the sender to timeout waiting for the corresponding ACK
> - Sender retransmits only the lost or corrupted packet
> - Window slides forward upon receiving ACKs, allowing new packets to be sent
> - **Selective Repeat allows for more efficient use of bandwidth by retransmitting only the lost or corrupted packets, unlike Go-Back-N, which retransmits all packets starting from the lost one**
> - **The receiver must have a buffer to store out-of-order packets until the missing packets are received, allowing for in-order delivery to the upper layer**
