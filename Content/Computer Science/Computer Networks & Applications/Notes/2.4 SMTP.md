| Electronic Mail Component            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| User Agents                          | Also known as "mail reader", this component is responsible for composing, editing, and reading mail messages. Examples include Outlook, Thunderbird, and iPhone mail client. It handles both outgoing and incoming messages stored on the server. |
| Mail Servers                         | These servers have mailboxes containing incoming messages for users and a message queue for outgoing (to be sent) mail messages.                                                                                                                  |
| Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) | This protocol is used between mail servers to send email messages. In this context, the client is the sending mail server and the "server" is the receiving mail server, which typically operates over TCP port 25.                               |
