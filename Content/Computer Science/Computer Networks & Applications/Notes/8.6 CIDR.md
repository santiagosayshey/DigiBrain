>
> CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses that **addresses the limitations of classful** addressing. CIDR allows us to **define where the network part ends and the host part starts**, rather than being constrained by the fixed boundaries of classful addressing.
>
> In CIDR notation, an IP address is written as **a.b.c.d/x**, where **x is the number of bits in the network portion** of the address. This allows for more flexible and efficient allocation of IP addresses, as the **network portion can be of any length**, not just 8, 16, or 24 bits as in classful addressing.
