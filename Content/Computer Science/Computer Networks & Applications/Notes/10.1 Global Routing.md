> [!motivation] The Challenge of Global Routing
> The Internet's vast scale and diverse ownership make it **impossible to use a single routing method for all devices**. Different networks have unique needs and priorities, **requiring a system that can handle both internal and external data** flow efficiently.

> [!idea] Solutions: Intra-AS and Inter-AS Routing
> 
> To tackle global routing, two complementary approaches are employed: Intra-AS and Inter-AS routing. 
> 
> - **Intra-AS** routing focuses on **optimizing data paths within a single Autonomous System**, where the network's internal state and topology are fully known and controlled. This allows for efficient local management. 
> - **Inter-AS routing then bridges these autonomous systems**, negotiating data paths based on broader policies and inter-network agreements, facilitating connectivity across the global Internet.

> [!example] Detailed Global Routing Journey
> 
> Imagine an email sent from a user in a remote area of Australia to a recipient in a major city in Germany. Initially, the email is managed by the local network of the sender, using Intra-AS routing to find the best path to the nearest larger network hub within the same Autonomous System. This might involve several hops through local routers and switches.
> 
> As the email moves from the rural area to a major Australian city, it may transition through different networks, each managed by separate Autonomous Systems. Here, Intra-AS routing within each network optimizes the path to the edge of each AS based on local conditions and configurations.
> 
> Once the email reaches a major international gateway in Australia, Inter-AS routing takes over. The email is routed across various international networks based on policies, peering agreements, and global traffic conditions. Each network's BGP routers negotiate the path that the email should take to reach Germany efficiently.
> 
> Upon entering Germany, the email again goes through multiple Intra-AS hops within the recipient's country, navigating through national and regional networks until it finally reaches the recipient's local network in the city. This final Intra-AS routing ensures the email is delivered to the recipient's device efficiently within the local conditions of the German network.
