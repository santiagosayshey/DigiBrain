> [!motivation] The Need for an Alternative to STP
> While the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) effectively prevents loops in switched networks, it has some limitations:
> - STP can be **slow to converge** when network topology changes occur, leading to temporary connectivity disruptions.
> - STP **does not necessarily create the most efficient spanning tree** in terms of total link cost or network performance.
> - STP may **underutilize network resources** by blocking redundant paths that could be used for load balancing.
> 
> To address these limitations, an alternative approach using Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) can be considered.

> [!idea] Using Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) in Switched Networks
> Instead of relying on STP to create a spanning tree, we can use MST algorithms to determine the optimal network topology when a switch is used:
> - The network is modeled as a weighted graph, with switches as vertices and links as edges, each having an associated cost (e.g., based on link speed, latency, or other metrics).
> - An MST algorithm, such as Prim's or Kruskal's, is applied to the graph to find the spanning tree with the minimum total cost of edges.
> - The resulting **MST represents the optimal topology for the switched network, minimizing the total cost of links while ensuring connectivity between all switches.**
> 
> If a link in the MST fails:
> - The **MST is recomputed to find the new optimal topology without the failed link**.
> - The network adapts to the new MST by updating the forwarding tables of the switches accordingly.

> [!example] MST-based Network Topology
> Consider a switched network with four switches (A, B, C, and D) and the following link costs:
> 
> | Link | Cost |
> |------|------|
> | A-B  | 2    |
> | A-C  | 3    |
> | B-C  | 1    |
> | B-D  | 4    |
> | C-D  | 5    |
> 
> By applying Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST, we get the following optimal topology:
> 
> ```
> (A)--2--(B)
>          |
>          1
>          |
>         (C)--5--(D)
> ```
> 
> The total cost of the MST is 2 + 1 + 5 = 8, which is the minimum among all possible spanning trees.
> 
> If the link between B and C fails, the MST is recomputed, and the new optimal topology becomes:
> 
> ```
> (A)--2--(B)--4--(D)
>   \           /
>    \         /
>     3       5
>      \     /
>       \   /
>        (C)
> ```
> 
> The network adapts to the new MST by updating the forwarding tables of the switches, ensuring connectivity is maintained.
