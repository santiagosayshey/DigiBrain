> Parity Bits are an error detection technique that **ensures the total number of 1's in the transmitted data, including the parity bit, is either odd OR even.**

> - For an odd parity bit:
> 	1. Count the number of 1's in the original data bits.
> 	2. If the count is odd, set the parity bit to 0 
> 	3. If the count is even, set the parity bit to 1
> 	4. Append the parity bit to the original data bits.
> 	5. If it were an even parity bit, they would swap

> 
> 1. **Original Data**: Consider an 8-bit data word: `10101001`.
> 
> 2. **Count 1's**: The number of 1's in the original data is 4 (even).
> 
> 3. **Set Parity Bit**: Since the count is even, the parity bit is set to 1 to make the total number of 1's odd.
> 
> 4. **Append Parity Bit**: The parity bit is appended to the original data: `101010011`.
> 
> 5. **Transmission**: The 9-bit data (including the parity bit) is transmitted.
> 
> 6. **Reception**: The receiver receives the 9-bit data: `101010011`.
> 
> 7. **Error Check**:
>    - The receiver counts the number of 1's in the received data (including the parity bit).
>    - If the count is odd (5 in this case), no error is detected.
>    - If the count is even, an error is detected, indicating that the data was corrupted during transmission.

> In this example, the odd parity scheme successfully detects single-bit errors, ensuring data integrity during transmission.

> [!consider] Issues with One-Dimensional Parity
> One-dimensional parity, while simple and effective for detecting single-bit errors, has significant limitations:
> 
> - **Multiple Errors**: It cannot detect errors if an even number of bits are flipped. For example, if two bits are flipped, the parity bit will still match the expected value, leading to undetected errors.
> - **Burst Errors**: In practical scenarios, errors often occur in bursts (several bits in a sequence), which one-dimensional parity fails to detect.
> - **Correction Limitation**: It only detects errors but cannot correct them. Once an error is detected, there's no information about which bit is erroneous.
> - **Overhead**: Adding a single parity bit increases the data transmission size by a minimal amount, but this small overhead does not compensate for its limited error detection capability in complex data transmissions.

> [!idea] Two-Dimensional Parity
> Two-dimensional parity improves error detection by arranging data in a grid and adding parity bits for each row and column. This technique provides a higher probability of detecting multiple errors.
> 
> - **Structure**:
>   1. Organize the data into a two-dimensional array.
>   2. Calculate parity bits for each row.
>   3. Calculate parity bits for each column.
>   4. Append the row and column parity bits to the array.
> - **Error Detection**: If any bit is altered, the corresponding row and column parity bits will indicate the presence of an error.
> - **Error Correction**: By identifying the specific row and column with errors, it is possible to pinpoint and correct a single erroneous bit.

> - **Error Localization**: While two-dimensional parity can detect multiple errors, it may not always precisely locate the errors. This is especially true if multiple errors occur across rows and columns, making it harder to pinpoint the exact erroneous bits.
> 
> - **Complexity**: Two-dimensional parity introduces additional complexity in both computation and error checking. The need to maintain parity bits for both rows and columns requires more processing and memory.
> 
> - **Overhead**: The addition of both row and column parity bits increases the amount of data transmitted, which can be significant for large data sets. This overhead can impact transmission efficiency and speed.
