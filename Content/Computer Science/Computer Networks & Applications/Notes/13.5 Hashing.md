> [!motivation] The Need for Data Integrity and Efficiency
> In cryptography, there is often a need to **ensure data integrity, verify the authenticity of messages**, and efficiently compare large amounts of data.
>
> - Ensuring data integrity is crucial in various scenarios, such as detecting data tampering or corruption during transmission or storage.
> - Verifying the authenticity of messages is essential to prevent impersonation and unauthorized modifications.
> - Comparing large datasets or files can be computationally expensive, requiring a more efficient approach.

> [!idea] Cryptographic Hash Functions
> Cryptographic hash functions address the issues of data integrity, message authentication, and efficient data comparison.
>
> - Definition: A cryptographic hash function is a **mathematical algorithm that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes**, typically a 'digest' that is unique to the specific input.
> - Properties:
>   - Deterministic: The same input always produces the same output.
>   - Quick Computation: The hash value can be computed quickly for any given input.
>   - Pre-Image Resistance: It is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value.
>   - Small Changes: A small change to the input results in a significantly different hash value.
>   - Collision Resistance: It is infeasible to find two different inputs with the same hash value.

> [!example] Password Storage
> One common application of cryptographic hash functions is secure password storage.
>
> - Instead of storing plaintext passwords, the system stores the hash values of the passwords.
> - During authentication, the user's entered password is hashed and compared with the stored hash value.
> - If an attacker gains access to the password database, they only see the hashed values, making it computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original passwords.

> [!example] File Integrity Verification
> Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the integrity of files or data.
>
> - A hash value is computed for the original file and securely stored or shared.
> - Later, to verify the file's integrity, the hash value is recomputed and compared with the original hash value.
> - If the hash values match, it indicates that the file has not been modified or corrupted.

> [!consider] Hashing Algorithm Vulnerabilities
> While cryptographic hash functions are designed to be secure, some widely used algorithms have been found to have vulnerabilities.
>
> - MD5: 
>   - Collisions were found in MD5, making it unsuitable for security-critical applications.
>   - Researchers demonstrated the ability to create two different inputs producing the same MD5 hash.
> - SHA-1:  
>   - Theoretical attacks on SHA-1 were discovered, indicating potential weaknesses.
>   - Major organizations and browsers have phased out the use of SHA-1.
>
> It is important to stay updated with the latest research and recommendations regarding the security of hashing algorithms and to use the most secure algorithms available, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.
