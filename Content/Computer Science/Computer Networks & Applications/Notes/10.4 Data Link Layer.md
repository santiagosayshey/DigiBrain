> [!motivation] Motivation
> Once the network layer determines the path for packets, the data link layer is **responsible for actually transmitting the data over the physical medium**. However, sending raw bits directly is prone to errors due to noise and interference.
> 
> The data link layer **acts as a "delivery truck" that carries packets from one node to the next**. It ensures that packets are not corrupted during transmission and can detect and possibly correct errors.

> [!idea] Data Link Layer
> The data link layer has two key responsibilities:
> 1. **Encapsulating data into frames**, which contain:
>    - Header: Source and destination MAC addresses, IP addresses, frame type, and control information.
>    - Payload: The actual data being transmitted, usually a packet from the network layer.
>    - Trailer: Error detection and correction information, such as a frame check sequence (FCS).
> 2. **Providing link access**: Controlling access to the physical medium using MAC protocols like CSMA/CD (Ethernet) or CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi).
> 3. **Providing reliable transport**: Ensuring data is delivered accurately between adjacent nodes through error detection, error correction, and flow control.

> [!consider] Why the Data Link Layer Provides Reliable Delivery
> Although TCP provides end-to-end reliability, the data link layer offers hop-by-hop reliability between adjacent nodes. This is important because:
> - It helps detect and correct errors early, preventing error propagation.
> - It **contains errors within a single network segment, preventing wasted bandwidth** and processing power.
> - Local retransmission is faster than end-to-end retransmission by TCP.
> - It adapts error control mechanisms to the specific needs of each link.

> [!consider] Data Link Layer Implementation
> The data link layer is implemented using both software and hardware:
> - **Software**: The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, responsible for error control and flow control, is typically implemented in software.
> - **Hardware**: The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer, handling framing, physical addressing, and access control, is often implemented in hardware using a Network Interface Card (NIC).
>   - **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: A hardware component that connects a device to the network, includes a unique MAC address, and sends/receives frames over the physical medium.
>   - **Integrated NICs**: Modern systems often have NICs integrated directly into the motherboard for simplicity and cost reduction.
