>[!idea]+ **Introduction to HTML**
>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It consists of elements defined by tags, which browsers interpret to display web pages. Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including tags, elements, and attributes, is crucial for web development.

| **Element** | **Function** | **Attributes** | **Example** |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| `<html>`    | The root of an HTML document. | - | `<html>...</html>` |
| `<head>`    | Contains metadata and scripts. | - | `<head>...</head>` |
| `<title>`   | Sets the document's title. | - | `<title>Page Title</title>` |
| `<body>`    | Hosts all the content visible on the page. | - | `<body>...</body>` |
| `<p>`       | Defines a paragraph. | - | `<p>Text</p>` |
| `<a>`       | Creates a hyperlink. | `href`, `target` | `<a href="url">Link</a>` |
| `<img>`     | Embeds an image. | `src`, `alt` | `<img src="image.jpg" alt="desc">` |
| `<ul>`, `<ol>` | Define unordered and ordered lists, respectively. | - | `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` |
| `<table>`  | Used to create a table. | - | `<table>...</table>` |
| `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>` | Table row, header, and cell. | `rowspan`, `colspan` | `<tr><td>Data</td></tr>` |
| `<form>`    | Defines a form for user input. | `action` | `<form>...</form>` |
| `<input>`   | Creates an input field. | `type`, `name` | `<input type="text" name="name">` |
| `<div>`     | A block-level container. | `id`, `class` | `<div>...</div>` |
| `<span>`    | An inline container. | `id`, `class` | `<span>Text</span>` |

>[!idea]+ **Special Characters in HTML**
>To represent reserved characters in HTML content, such as `<` and `>`, HTML employs character entities. For `<`, use `&lt;` and for `>`, use `&gt;`. This allows you to include these characters in your web page without the browser interpreting them as code.

>[!idea]+ **Document Validation for Cross-Browser Compatibility**
>Ensuring your HTML is compliant with web standards is crucial for maintaining cross-browser compatibility. Use the W3C validator to check your HTML documents. This practice helps identify and correct errors, ensuring your website behaves consistently across different browsers.


>[!idea]+ **Using the `id` Attribute**
>The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier to an HTML element. It's invaluable for CSS styling and JavaScript operations, allowing you to target and manipulate specific elements directly.

>[!idea]+ **Grouping Elements with the `class` Attribute**
>The `class` attribute groups multiple elements under a common identifier. This is especially useful for applying the same CSS styles or performing the same JavaScript actions on several elements simultaneously.

>[!idea]+ **Inline Styling**
>While the `style` attribute enables direct styling of an HTML element with CSS, it's recommended to use external or internal CSS stylesheets. This separation of content and presentation enhances maintainability and scalability of web projects.
