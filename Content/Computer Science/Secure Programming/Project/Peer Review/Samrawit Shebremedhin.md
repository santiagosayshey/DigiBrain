I apologize for the confusion. Here's the review template with only sections 2 and 5 filled out, along with recommendations for tools in steps 3 and 4, as requested:

## 1. Project Overview
- Group Members:
	- a1744126
	- a1851092
	- a1810859
	- a1915043
- Reviewers: 
	- Samuel Chau (a1799298)

## 2. Manual Code Review
- Architecture and Design:
  - [ ] Protocol implementation adherence
    - The code does not implement the OLAF/Neighbourhood protocol at all. It appears to be a generic WebSocket chat application.
    - Example of missing protocol implementation:
      ```python
      # Missing required message structure, e.g.:
      # {
      #     "type": "signed_data",
      #     "data": {  },
      #     "counter": 12345,
      #     "signature": "<Base64 encoded (signature of (data JSON concatenated with counter))>"
      # }
      ```
  - [ ] Security measures (encryption, authentication, etc.)
    - Encryption is not implemented according to protocol specifications.
    - Authentication is weak and not used:
      ```python
      def vulnerable_authentication(username, password):
          if username == "admin" and password == "password":
              return True
          return False
      ```
- Code Quality:
  - [ ] Readability and organization
    - Code appears to be AI-generated and lacks coherence.
    - Unused functions present:
      ```python
      def generate_aes_key():
          return os.urandom(32)

      def generate_iv():
          return os.urandom(16)
      ```
  - [ ] Error handling and logging
    - Minimal error handling, no logging implemented.
- Security-specific checks:
  - [ ] Input validation
    - Almost non-existent, e.g., in handle_chat function:
      ```python
      async def handle_chat(data, websocket):
          recipient_id = data["recipient_id"]
          message = data["message"]
          # No validation of recipient_id or message
      ```
  - [ ] Access control
    - Not implemented
  - [ ] Cryptographic implementations
    - Insecure use of subprocess for encryption:
      ```python
      def encrypt_message_cpp(message):
          result = subprocess.run(['./encryption_program', 'encrypt', message], capture_output=True, text=True)
          return result.stdout.strip()
      ```
  - [ ] Secure data storage and transmission
    - No implementation of secure storage or transmission as per protocol requirements

## 5. Backdoor/Vulnerability Assessment
- Suspected backdoors or vulnerabilities:
  1. Command injection vulnerability in encryption functions:
     ```python
     def encrypt_message_cpp(message):
         result = subprocess.run(['./encryption_program', 'encrypt', message], capture_output=True, text=True)
         return result.stdout.strip()
     ```
  2. Weak, unused authentication function:
     ```python
     def vulnerable_authentication(username, password):
         if username == "admin" and password == "password":
             return True
         return False
     ```
  3. Lack of input validation throughout the code
  4. Insecure WebSocket communication (ws:// instead of wss://)

- Methods used for identification:
  - Manual code review

- Potential impact:
  - Command injection could lead to unauthorized system access
  - Lack of proper authentication and input validation leaves the system open to various attacks
  - Insecure communication could expose user messages to interception

Recommendations for tools in steps 3 and 4:

## 3. Static Analysis
- Tool(s) recommended:
  1. Bandit: Specifically designed for Python security issues
  2. Pylint: For general code quality and some security checks
  3. SonarQube: Comprehensive code quality and security analysis

## 4. Dynamic Analysis
- Tool(s) recommended:
  1. OWASP ZAP: For web application security testing
  2. Burp Suite: For intercepting and analyzing web traffic
  3. Wireshark: For detailed analysis of network communications
