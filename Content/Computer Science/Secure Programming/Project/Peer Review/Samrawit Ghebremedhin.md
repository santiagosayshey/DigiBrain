**Manual Code Review for** Samrawit Ghebremedhin 

**1. Conformance with the Specified Protocol**

- **Message Structure Non-compliance:** The code does not include message counters or signatures. Messages lack the required structure specified in the protocol.
- **Missing Encryption and Signing:** There is no implementation of RSA or AES encryption. Messages are sent in plaintext without any signing, making them vulnerable to interception and tampering.
- **Client Authentication Missing:** The `hello` message does not include the client's public key, nor does it establish a secure identity.
- **Protocol Deviations:** The server and client handle messages in a way that does not align with the specified protocol. For instance, the `chat` message does not follow the defined encrypted structure.

**Conclusion:** The code significantly deviates from the specified protocol, lacking essential security features and failing to implement the required message formats.

**2. Security Vulnerabilities**

**Intentional Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection via `subprocess.run()`:**
  - The `encrypt_message_cpp` and `decrypt_message_cpp` functions use `subprocess.run()` with user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
    ```python
    result = subprocess.run(['./encryption_program', 'encrypt', message], capture_output=True, text=True)
    ```
  - **Risk:** An attacker could inject arbitrary commands, leading to command execution on the server.

- **Sender Spoofing Due to Lack of Validation:**
  - The server does not verify the sender's identity in incoming messages.
  - **Risk:** Clients can impersonate other users, sending messages on their behalf.

**Unintentional Vulnerabilities:**

- **Hardcoded Credentials in `vulnerable_authentication()`:**
  - Uses fixed username and password ("admin", "password").
    ```python
    if username == "admin" and password == "password":
    ```
  - **Risk:** Easily exploitable if the function were used, leading to unauthorized access.

- **No TLS Encryption:**
  - The server uses `ws://` instead of `wss://`, transmitting data in plaintext.
  - **Risk:** Susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Lack of Input Validation:**
  - The server does not validate or sanitize incoming data.
  - **Risk:** Potential for injection attacks or server crashes due to malformed data.

- **Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS):**
  - No rate limiting or message size checks.
  - **Risk:** Attackers could overwhelm the server with large messages or rapid requests.

**Conclusion:** The application contains severe security flaws that could be exploited both intentionally and unintentionally, compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**3. Code Quality Issues**

- **Unused Functions:**
  - `vulnerable_authentication()`, `generate_aes_key()`, and `generate_iv()` are defined but never called.
  - **Impact:** Increases code complexity and may confuse code reviewers or maintainers.

- **Comments Revealing Vulnerabilities:**
  - Comments explicitly point out vulnerabilities.
    ```python
    # Vulnerable area: This function could potentially be exploited by a malicious user.
    ```
  - **Impact:** Counteracts the purpose of hidden backdoors by making them obvious.

- **Non-Adherence to Assignment Instructions:**
  - The code does not implement the agreed-upon protocol, which was a core requirement.
  - **Impact:** Fails to meet the assignment objectives, affecting interoperability and learning outcomes.

- **Simplistic Client Implementation:**
  - The client does not handle encryption, signatures, or any advanced features.
  - **Impact:** Limits functionality and does not provide a realistic environment for testing.

- **Poor Error Handling:**
  - The server does not handle exceptions or errors robustly.
  - **Impact:** Could lead to server crashes or undefined behavior upon unexpected input.

**Conclusion:** The code quality is subpar, with signs of incomplete implementation and lack of adherence to best practices.

**4. Indicators of AI-Generated Code**

- **Generic and Redundant Comments:**
  - Comments state the obvious or directly point out vulnerabilities, which is atypical for human-written code intended to conceal backdoors.

- **Inconsistent Naming Conventions:**
  - Function and variable names are generic and lack contextual relevance.

- **Lack of Code Personalization:**
  - The code lacks unique identifiers or personalized structures that are common in human-developed code.

- **Over-Simplification:**
  - The code simplifies complex processes, such as encryption and authentication, to a degree that suggests automated generation.

**Conclusion:** The code exhibits characteristics commonly associated with AI-generated code, indicating minimal human refinement.

**5. Advice on Static and Dynamic Analysis**

**Static Analysis:**

- **Use Security Linters:**
  - Run tools like **Bandit** for Python to detect common security issues.
    ```
    bandit -r chat_server.py
    ```
  - **Findings:** Should highlight the use of `subprocess.run()` with unsanitized input, hardcoded credentials, and other security concerns.

- **Code Quality Linters:**
  - Use **Pylint** or **Flake8** to identify code quality issues.
    ```
    pylint chat_server.py
    flake8 chat_server.py
    ```
  - **Findings:** Will point out unused imports, variables, functions, and stylistic issues.

- **Manual Code Review:**
  - **Focus Areas:**
    - Unsanitized inputs and outputs.
    - Hardcoded secrets or credentials.
    - Compliance with coding standards.
    - Comment analysis to identify misplaced or revealing comments.

**Dynamic Analysis:**

- **Runtime Monitoring:**
  - Use tools like **strace** or **ltrace** to monitor system calls during execution.
    - **Objective:** Observe if unintended system calls are made, especially when handling user inputs.

- **Penetration Testing:**
  - **Command Injection Testing:**
    - Attempt to exploit the `subprocess.run()` vulnerability by injecting commands.
      - **Example Payload:**
        ```json
        {"type": "encrypt_message", "message": "test; ls -la"}
        ```
    - **Safety Precaution:** Ensure testing is done in a controlled environment.

- **Network Traffic Analysis:**
  - Use **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic.
    - **Objective:** Confirm that messages are transmitted in plaintext and identify potential data leakage.

- **Fuzz Testing:**
  - Use fuzzing tools to send random data to the server.
    - **Objective:** Identify how the server handles unexpected or malformed inputs.

- **Resource Utilization Monitoring:**
  - Monitor CPU and memory usage during testing.
    - **Objective:** Detect potential DoS vulnerabilities due to resource exhaustion.

**Conclusion:** Employing both static and dynamic analysis tools will provide a comprehensive understanding of the application's security posture and code quality.
