> [!idea] Worms: Self-Propagating Malware
> Worms are malicious programs that **spread across networks without requiring user interaction.**
> - **Propagation Methods**:
>   - Random Targeting: Select random machines to infect.
>   - Victim Searching: Scan networks to discover vulnerable targets.
>   - Target Lists: Use predefined lists of potential victims.
>   - Passive Waiting: Remain idle until contacted by other systems.
> - **Infection Techniques**:
>   - Buffer Overflows: Exploit code injection vulnerabilities.
>   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Leverage web application flaws.

> [!consider] Modeling Worm Propagation
> Worms can spread rapidly, often exhibiting **exponential growth** as more machines become infected.
> - **Epidemiological Models**: Similar to infectious disease spread models.
> - **Factors Influencing Spread**:
>   - Population Size: Total number of potential hosts.
>   - Vulnerability Proportion: Percentage of susceptible machines.
>   - Number of Infected Hosts: Current infection count.
>   - Contact Rate: Frequency of interactions between hosts.
> - **Logistic Growth**: Rapid initial spread that **tapers off** as uninfected hosts decrease.

> [!example] WannaCry Ransomware Worm
> **WannaCry** is a ransomware worm that emerged in May 2017, causing widespread disruption globally.
> - **Propagation Method**: Exploited the **EternalBlue** vulnerability (MS17-010) in the Windows **SMBv1 protocol** to spread between computers **without user interaction**.
> - **Infection Process**:
>   - Scanned networks for vulnerable systems.
>   - Used the exploit to gain access and execute the ransomware payload.
>   - Encrypted user files and displayed a ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin.
> - **Impact**:
>   - Affected over 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries.
>   - Disrupted critical services, including hospitals, telecommunications, and transportation.
>   - Notably impacted the UK's National Health Service (NHS), leading to canceled appointments and operations.
> - **Mitigation**:
>   - A security researcher activated a "kill switch" by registering a domain found in the malware's code, slowing the spread.
>   - Microsoft released patches to address the vulnerability, even for unsupported systems like Windows XP.
> - **Significance**:
>   - Highlighted the risks of unpatched systems and the potential scale of ransomware attacks.
>   - Emphasized the importance of timely software updates and robust cybersecurity practices.

> [!example] Drive-By Downloads
> **Drive-By Downloads** occur when malicious software is downloaded onto a user's computer **without their knowledge or consent** upon visiting a compromised or malicious website.
> - **Propagation Method**:
>   - Attackers inject malicious code into legitimate websites or set up malicious sites.
>   - Exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers, plugins, or scripts (e.g., outdated Flash, Java).
> - **Infection Process**:
>   - Users visit the infected site, triggering automatic download and execution of malware.
>   - No additional user action, such as clicking or downloading, is required.
> - **Types of Malware Delivered**:
>   - Trojans, ransomware, spyware, keyloggers, and backdoors.
> - **Prevention Measures**:
>   - Keep browsers and plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
>   - Use security software with real-time protection and web filtering.
>   - Enable browser security features to block or prompt for scripts and plugins.
>   - Practice safe browsing habits and avoid untrusted websites.

> [!example] Malvertising (Malicious Advertising)
> **Malvertising** involves distributing malware through **malicious online advertisements** displayed on legitimate websites.
> - **Propagation Method**:
>   - Attackers submit malicious ads to ad networks or compromise ad servers.
>   - These ads are served on popular websites via third-party ad networks.
>   - Users are exposed to malicious content without the website's knowledge.
> - **Infection Process**:
>   - Malicious ads may redirect users to harmful sites or execute code exploiting browser vulnerabilities.
>   - Infection can occur **without the user clicking** on the ad.
> - **Challenges**:
>   - Difficult to detect due to use of trusted ad networks and reputable websites.
>   - Even well-secured websites can inadvertently serve malvertisements.
> - **Notable Incidents**:
>   - High-traffic websites like The New York Times, BBC, and AOL have unknowingly displayed malvertising campaigns.
> - **Prevention Measures**:
>   - Ad networks implementing stricter vetting and monitoring of advertisements.
>   - Users employing ad-blockers or security extensions.
>   - Keeping software updated to mitigate exploitation of vulnerabilities.

> [!example] Watering Hole Attacks
> **Watering Hole Attacks** target specific groups or organizations by **compromising websites that they frequently visit**.
> - **Propagation Method**:
>   - Attackers identify websites popular with the target audience.
>   - Compromise the site by injecting malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities.
> - **Infection Process**:
>   - When target users visit the compromised site, they are infected through drive-by downloads or other exploits.
>   - Malware may include spyware, backdoors, or zero-day exploits tailored to the target.
> - **Selective Targeting**:
>   - Attackers may filter victims based on IP addresses, geolocation, or browser characteristics.
> - **Examples**:
>   - In 2013, attackers compromised the website of the Council on Foreign Relations to target specific visitors.
>   - A 2017 attack on Polish financial institutions involved compromising a government website to distribute malware to banks.
> - **Prevention Measures**:
>   - Regular security updates and monitoring of websites frequented by potential targets.
>   - Use of advanced threat detection systems and network segmentation.
>   - User vigilance, even when visiting trusted websites.

> [!example] Clickjacking
> **Clickjacking** tricks users into clicking on hidden or disguised elements on a webpage, leading to unintended actions.
> - **Propagation Method**:
>   - Attackers overlay transparent or opaque layers over legitimate web content.
>   - Users believe they are interacting with the visible page, but are actually clicking hidden elements.
> - **Consequences**:
>   - Unauthorized actions like changing security settings, initiating financial transactions, or downloading malware.
>   - Potential for account takeover or leakage of sensitive information.
> - **Notable Examples**:
>   - "Likejacking" on social media, where users unknowingly "like" a page or share content.
>   - Enabling webcams or microphones without user consent.
> - **Prevention Measures**:
>   - Websites implementing **X-Frame-Options** or **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers to prevent framing.
>   - Use of **frame-busting** scripts to prevent unauthorized framing of content.
>   - Users can adjust browser settings or use extensions to block clickjacking attempts.

> [!example] Stuxnet Worm
> **Stuxnet** is a highly sophisticated worm discovered in 2010, designed to **sabotage Iran's nuclear enrichment program**.
> - **Propagation Method**:
>   - Spread via infected USB drives and local networks.
>   - Exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows systems.
> - **Target and Purpose**:
>   - Specifically targeted Siemens Step7 software running on PLCs controlling centrifuges.
>   - Manipulated centrifuge speeds to cause physical damage while masking the changes from operators.
> - **Technical Complexity**:
>   - Utilized four zero-day exploits and two stolen digital certificates for code signing.
>   - Contained both Windows-based components and PLC-specific payloads.
> - **Impact**:
>   - Damaged up to 1,000 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear facility.
>   - Delayed Iran's nuclear enrichment activities significantly.
> - **Significance**:
