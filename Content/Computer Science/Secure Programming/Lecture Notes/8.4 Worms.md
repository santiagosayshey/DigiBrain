idea - worms
- code that does not require user interaction to propagate
- how?
	- randomly choose machine to infect
	- search for victims
	- look for targets through scanning
	- target lists
	- passively wait for a user to contact you
- what?
	- buffer overflows for code injection
	- xss vulnerability

consder - modelling propagation
- can grow exponentially as more machines get infected
- modelled using the same idea as spread of infectious disease
- depends on:
