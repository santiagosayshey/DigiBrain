> [!idea] Worms: Self-Propagating Malware
> Worms are malicious programs that spread across networks without requiring user interaction.
> - **Propagation Methods**:
>   - **Random Targeting**: Select random machines to infect.
>   - **Victim Searching**: Scan networks to discover vulnerable targets.
>   - **Target Lists**: Use predefined lists of potential victims.
>   - **Passive Waiting**: Remain idle until contacted by other systems.
> - **Infection Techniques**:
>   - **Buffer Overflows**: Exploit code injection vulnerabilities.
>   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Leverage web application flaws.

> [!consider] Modeling Worm Propagation
> Worms can spread rapidly, often exhibiting exponential growth as more machines become infected.
> - **Epidemiological Models**: Similar to infectious disease spread models.
> - **Factors Influencing Spread**:
>   - **Population Size**: Total number of potential hosts.
>   - **Vulnerability Proportion**: Percentage of susceptible machines.
>   - **Number of Infected Hosts**: Current infection count.
>   - **Contact Rate**: Frequency of interactions between hosts.
> - **Logistic Growth**: Rapid initial spread that tapers off as uninfected hosts decrease.

> [!example] WannaCry Worm
> WannaCry is a ransomware worm that emerged in 2017, rapidly infecting computers worldwide.
> - **Propagation Method**: Exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability in the Windows SMB protocol to spread across networks.
> - **Impact**: Encrypted user data and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin.
> - **Global Reach**: Affected over 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, disrupting services like healthcare and transportation.

> [!example] Drive-By Downloads
> Drive-By Downloads infect users who visit compromised or malicious websites without any user interaction.
> - **Propagation Method**: Injects malicious code into websites, exploiting browser or plugin vulnerabilities.
> - **Infection Process**: Malware is automatically downloaded and executed when the webpage is accessed.
> - **Prevention**: Keeping browsers and plugins updated reduces the risk of exploitation.

> [!example] Malvertising
> Malvertising involves distributing malware through malicious advertisements on legitimate websites.
> - **Propagation Method**: Attackers submit infected ads to ad networks, which are then displayed on reputable sites.
> - **Infection Without Clicks**: Some malvertisements can infect users even if the ad is not clicked, using auto-executing code.
> - **Challenge**: Difficult to detect as it leverages trusted advertising channels.

> [!example] Watering Hole Attacks
> Watering hole attacks target specific groups by compromising websites they are likely to visit.
> - **Propagation Method**: Injects malware into frequently visited sites of a particular community or organization.
> - **Selective Targeting**: Aims to infect users who meet certain criteria, like IP ranges or user-agent strings.
> - **Example**: Compromising industry forums to attack professionals in that sector.

> [!example] Clickjacking
> Clickjacking tricks users into clicking on hidden or disguised elements on a webpage.
> - **Propagation Method**: Overlays invisible frames or buttons over legitimate content.
> - **Consequences**: Users may unknowingly change security settings, authorize transactions, or download malware.
> - **Prevention**: Websites can use frame-busting techniques and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

> [!example] Stuxnet Worm
> Stuxnet is a sophisticated worm discovered in 2010, designed to disrupt industrial systems.
> - **Propagation Method**: Spread through infected USB drives and network shares.
> - **Target**: Specifically aimed at Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities by altering the operation of centrifuges.
> - **Significance**: First known malware to cause physical damage to equipment, marking a new era in cyber warfare.
