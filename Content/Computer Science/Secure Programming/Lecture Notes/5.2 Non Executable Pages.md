> [!idea] Non-Executable Pages
> Non-executable pages, also known as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or No-Execute (NX), **mark certain memory pages as non-executable, preventing code execution from those regions.** We achieve this by **setting write and execute bits on page tables.** 
> 
> Key points:
> - The stack is intended for storing data, not code, so making it executable is unnecessary and potentially dangerous.
> - By marking the stack and other data regions as non-executable, DEP/NX prevents attackers from executing injected shellcode via buffer overflow exploits.
> - DEP/NX does not prevent all types of attacks, such as heap overflows or return-oriented programming (ROP), which reuse existing code snippets.
> - DEP/NX is widely supported by modern processors and operating systems, making it a standard exploit mitigation technique.


> [!example] DEP/NX in Action
> Consider a simple buffer overflow vulnerability in a program:
> ```c
> void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
>     char buffer[100];
>     strcpy(buffer, input);
> }
> ```
> Without DEP/NX, an attacker could:
> 1. Send a long input that overflows the `buffer` and overwrites the return address on the stack.
> 2. Include shellcode in the input, which gets executed when the function returns.
>
> With DEP/NX enabled:
> 1. The stack is marked as non-executable.
> 2. If the attacker tries to execute shellcode on the stack, the program crashes due to a violation of the non-executable permission.
> 3. The exploit attempt is thwarted, protecting the system from arbitrary code execution.


> [!consider] Exploiting DEP/NX
> While DEP/NX makes it harder to execute injected shellcode, attackers have found ways to bypass this protection:
> 
> 1. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks**: Triggering a crash by attempting to execute code on a non-executable page can be used as a DoS attack, even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved.
>
> 2. **Return-to-libc attacks**: Instead of injecting shellcode, attackers can redirect execution to existing code in the C standard library (libc), which is already loaded in executable memory. By carefully crafting the stack, attackers can chain together calls to libc functions to perform malicious actions.
>
> 3. **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**: ROP is an advanced technique that allows attackers to create custom "shellcode" using small code snippets (gadgets) that already exist in executable memory. By chaining together these gadgets, attackers can perform arbitrary computations and bypass DEP/NX.
>    - Gadgets are short instruction sequences that end with a `ret` instruction, allowing the attacker to control the execution flow.
>    - The attacker identifies suitable gadgets in the program's code or linked libraries.
>    - By carefully manipulating the stack, the attacker can chain together gadgets to perform the desired actions, essentially creating a "program" using existing code snippets.
