> [!consider] Taint Analysis
> Taint analysis is a technique used to t**rack the flow of untrusted or potentially malicious data (known as "taint") through a program**. It helps identify vulnerabilities by:
> - Marking input data as tainted
> - Propagating taint through data flow
> - Detecting when tainted data reaches sensitive sinks (e.g., SQL queries, file writes)
>
> Taint analysis can be performed statically (by analyzing code) or dynamically (by tracking data at runtime). It is particularly useful for detecting vulnerabilities like:
> - SQL injection
> - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
> - Command injection
> - File inclusion vulnerabilities
>
> By identifying the flow of tainted data, developers can apply appropriate sanitization or validation techniques to mitigate risks.

> [!example] Taint Analysis Example
> Consider the following vulnerable PHP code:
> ```php
> $username = $_GET['username'];
> $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";
> $result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);
> ```
> Taint analysis would:
> 1. Mark `$_GET['username']` as tainted data
> 2. Track the flow of tainted data to `$username` and `$query`
> 3. Detect that tainted data reaches the sensitive sink `mysqli_query()`
> 4. Flag a potential SQL injection vulnerability
>
> To fix the vulnerability, the code should sanitize the tainted data:
> ```php
> $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, $_GET['username']);
> $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";
> $result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);
> ```
> Taint analysis helps identify such vulnerabilities and prompts developers to apply appropriate sanitization techniques.
