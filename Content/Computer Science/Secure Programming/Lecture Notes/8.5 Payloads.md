new note - paylods

idea - remote control facilities
- distinguish bots (come from and are controleld by RCFs) from worms (progates and activates itself)
- facilated through irc / discord
	- explain more, how they work, etc


example - keyloggers and spyware

example - information theft phishing

example - stealthing backdoor (trapdoor)

idea - rootkit

example - sony BMG cd rootkit

consider - how to defend against?
- use non standard programs to obtain the same information that standard ones should; then compare
- dirdump compared to ls - if dirdump outputs something different or vice versa, then one is compromised
- next step? attackers alter the kernel (explain with an example sucKIT), so we defend by comparing sys call table with copy stored at boot time

consider - once infected, how we get rid of it?
- restoring / repairing many files
- rebuild from backups / restore from scratch
- what if malware infected build tools? good luck chuck
