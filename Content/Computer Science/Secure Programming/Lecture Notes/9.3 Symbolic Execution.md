> [!motivation] Automatic Test Generation
> Software testing is crucial but **manually writing test cases to cover all possible outputs is time-consuming and error-prone**. Automated test generation techniques can significantly improve testing efficiency and coverage. The key challenges are:
> - Efficiently exploring the vast input space 
> - Generating inputs that trigger different program behaviors
> - Maximizing code coverage with a minimal set of test cases

> [!idea] Symbolic Execution
> Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique used for automatic test generation and bug finding. It works by **executing the program with symbolic inputs, which represent arbitrary values,** and maintaining symbolic expressions for program variables. As the program runs:
> 1. Branch conditions are represented as symbolic constraints
> 2. Each branching point creates new paths to explore
> 3. Path conditions are solved to generate concrete test inputs
> 4. Generated inputs exercise different program paths
>
> Key aspects of symbolic execution include:
> - Symbolic state: Maintains symbolic expressions for program variables
> - Path condition: Accumulates constraints on symbolic inputs along a path
> - Constraint solver: Solves path conditions to generate concrete inputs
> - Path exploration: Systematically explores different program paths
>
> Symbolic execution enables systematic testing by generating inputs that trigger different program behaviors and cover various code paths. It can achieve high coverage and expose subtle bugs that might be missed by manual testing.

> [!example] Symbolic Execution of a Binary Search Function
> Consider the following binary search function:
> ```python
> def binary_search(arr, target):
>     low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
>     while low <= high:
>         mid = (low + high) // 2
>         if arr[mid] == target:
>             return mid
>         elif arr[mid] < target:
>             low = mid + 1
>         else:
>             high = mid - 1
>     return -1
> ```
> Symbolic execution of this function proceeds as follows:
> 1. Initialize `arr` and `target` with symbolic values, e.g., `arr = [A, B, C]`, `target = T`
> 2. Execute the code, maintaining symbolic expressions and generating path conditions:
>    - `low = 0`, `high = 2`
>    - In the first iteration:
>      - `mid = 1`, `arr[mid] = B`
>      - Branch conditions: `B == T`, `B < T`, `B > T`
>    - Subsequent iterations generate additional path conditions
> 3. Solve path conditions to generate test inputs:
>    - Path 1: `B == T`, generate `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `target = 2`
>    - Path 2: `B < T, C == T`, generate `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `target = 3`
>    - Path 3: `B < T, C < T`, generate `arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `target = 4`
>    - Path 4: `B > T, A == T`, generate `arr = [2, 3, 4]`, `target = 2`
>    - ...
> 4. Execute the function with the generated inputs to cover different paths
>
> The symbolic execution tree for this function looks like:
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A((Start)) --> B{B == T}
>     B -->|True| C[return 1]
>     B -->|False| D{B < T}
>     D -->|True| E{C == T}
>     E -->|True| F[return 2]
>     E -->|False| G{C < T}
>     G -->|True| H[return -1]
>     D -->|False| I{A == T}
>     I -->|True| J[return 0]
>     I -->|False| K{A < T}
>     K -->|True| L[return -1]
> ```
> By solving the path conditions, we generate test inputs that cover different paths in the binary search function, including finding the target at different positions and handling the case when the target is not present.
