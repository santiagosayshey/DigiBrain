> [!motivation] Automatic Test Generation
> Software testing is crucial but **manually writing test cases to cover all possible outputs is time-consuming and error-prone**. Automated test generation techniques can significantly improve testing efficiency and coverage. The key challenges are:
> - Efficiently exploring the vast input space 
> - Generating inputs that trigger different program behaviors
> - Maximizing code coverage with a minimal set of test cases

> [!idea] Symbolic Execution
> Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique used for automatic test generation and bug finding. It works by **executing the program with symbolic inputs, which represent arbitrary values,** and maintaining symbolic expressions for program variables. As the program runs:
> 1. Branch conditions are represented as symbolic constraints
> 2. Each branching point creates new paths to explore
> 3. Path conditions are solved to generate concrete test inputs
> 4. Generated inputs exercise different program paths
>
> Key aspects of symbolic execution include:
> - Symbolic state: Maintains symbolic expressions for program variables
> - Path condition: Accumulates constraints on symbolic inputs along a path
> - Constraint solver: Solves path conditions to generate concrete inputs
> - Path exploration: Systematically explores different program paths
>
> Symbolic execution enables systematic testing by **generating inputs that trigger different program behaviors and cover various code paths**. It can achieve high coverage and expose subtle bugs that might be missed by manual testing.

> [!example] Symbolic Execution of a Discount Calculation Function
> Consider the following function that calculates the discounted price based on the customer's membership level and total purchase amount:
> ```python
> def calculate_discount(membership_level, purchase_amount):
>     if membership_level == "gold":
>         if purchase_amount > 1000:
>             return purchase_amount * 0.8
>         else:
>             return purchase_amount * 0.9
>     elif membership_level == "silver":
>         if purchase_amount > 500:
>             return purchase_amount * 0.9
>         else:
>             return purchase_amount * 0.95
>     else:
>         return purchase_amount
> ```
> Symbolic execution of this function proceeds as follows:
> 1. Initialize `membership_level` and `purchase_amount` with symbolic values, e.g., `membership_level = M`, `purchase_amount = A`
> 2. Execute the code, maintaining symbolic expressions and generating path conditions:
>    - Branch conditions: `M == "gold"`, `A > 1000`, `M == "silver"`, `A > 500`
>    - Path conditions:
>      - Path 1: `M == "gold" ∧ A > 1000`
>      - Path 2: `M == "gold" ∧ A <= 1000`
>      - Path 3: `M == "silver" ∧ A > 500`
>      - Path 4: `M == "silver" ∧ A <= 500`
>      - Path 5: `M != "gold" ∧ M != "silver"`
> 3. Solve path conditions to generate test inputs:
>    - Path 1: `M = "gold"`, `A = 1500`
>    - Path 2: `M = "gold"`, `A = 800`
>    - Path 3: `M = "silver"`, `A = 750`
>    - Path 4: `M = "silver"`, `A = 400`
>    - Path 5: `M = "bronze"`, `A = 600`
> 4. Execute the function with the generated inputs to cover different paths
>
> The symbolic execution tree for this function looks like:
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A((Start)) --> B{M == gold}
>     B -->|True| C{A > 1000}
>     C -->|True| D[return A * 0.8]
>     C -->|False| E[return A * 0.9]
>     B -->|False| F{M == silver}
>     F -->|True| G{A > 500}
>     G -->|True| H[return A * 0.9]
>     G -->|False| I[return A * 0.95]
>     F -->|False| J[return A]
> ```
> By solving the path conditions, we generate test inputs that cover different paths in the discount calculation function, taking into account the different membership levels and purchase amount thresholds.
