Apologies for not meeting your expectations earlier. Here is the revised note on symbolic execution, following your instructions.

> [!motivation] Automatic Test Generation
>
> To thoroughly analyze programs, we aim to cover all possible outputs by testing different execution paths. However, testing every possible input is impractical due to the immense input space.
>
> - **Equivalence Classes**: By dividing inputs into equivalence classes—groups of inputs that produce the same behavior—we can efficiently test one representative from each class.
> - **Goal**: Ensure comprehensive coverage without exhaustive testing by focusing on significant input variations.

> [!idea] Symbolic Execution
>
> Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique that treats inputs as symbolic variables rather than concrete values. It systematically explores all feasible execution paths by evaluating symbolic expressions and collecting path conditions—logical constraints that describe the inputs leading to each path.
>
> - **Path Exploration**: Follows all possible branches in the code by considering symbolic conditions at each decision point.
> - **Path Conditions**: Accumulates constraints (e.g., \( x > 0 \), \( y = x + 5 \)) that must hold for a particular execution path.
> - **Constraint Solving**: Uses solvers to find concrete inputs satisfying these conditions, enabling automated test case generation.
> - **Benefits**: Helps detect bugs, generate inputs for edge cases, and achieve high code coverage by exploring paths that might be missed with random testing.

> [!example] Symbolic Execution Example
>
> Consider the following code snippet:
>
> ```c
> void analyzeInput(int x) {
>     if (x > 10) {
>         if (x % 2 == 0) {
>             printf("Large even number\n");
>         } else {
>             printf("Large odd number\n");
>         }
>     } else {
>         printf("Small number\n");
>     }
> }
> ```

> Symbolic execution explores all execution paths with symbolic input `x` and generates the following path conditions:
>
> | Path | Path Condition                      | Output                  |
> |------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
> | 1    | \( x > 10 \) and \( x \% 2 == 0 \)    | "Large even number"     |
> | 2    | \( x > 10 \) and \( x \% 2 \neq 0 \)  | "Large odd number"      |
> | 3    | \( x \leq 10 \)                       | "Small number"          |

> By solving the path conditions, we obtain concrete inputs:
>
> - **Path 1**: `x = 12` (any even number greater than 10)
> - **Path 2**: `x = 11` (any odd number greater than 10)
> - **Path 3**: `x = 10` (any number less than or equal to 10)
