> [!motivation] Evasion of Signature-Based Detection
> Traditional antivirus systems rely on identifying known patterns or signatures in malicious code. Attackers aim to bypass these systems to ensure their malware remains undetected during propagation.

> [!idea] Metamorphic Code
> Metamorphic code is a technique where malware modifies its own code structure with each infection to evade signature-based detection.
> - **Self-Rewriting**: The virus includes a code rewriter that alters its code randomly while maintaining the same functionality.
> - **Transformation Methods**:
>   - **Register Renumbering**: Changing the registers used in the code.
>   - **Instruction Reordering**: Altering the order of conditional statements or instructions.
>   - **Code Substitution**: Replacing code segments with different sequences that perform the same operation.
> - **Outcome**: Each new version is semantically identical but syntactically different from the original.

> [!example] Code Transformation Techniques
> - **Register Renumbering**:
>   - Original: `ADD EAX, EBX`
>   - Transformed: `ADD ECX, EDX`
> - **Instruction Reordering**:
>   - Original:
>     - `CMP EAX, EBX`
>     - `JNE label`
>   - Transformed:
>     - `JNE label`
>     - `CMP EAX, EBX`
> - **Code Substitution**:
>   - Original: `INC EAX`
>   - Transformed: `ADD EAX, 1`
>
> **Table of Transformations**:
>
> | Technique             | Original Code    | Transformed Code    |
> |-----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
> | Register Renumbering  | `MOV EAX, 1`     | `MOV EDX, 1`        |
> | Instruction Reordering| See above        | See above           |
> | Code Substitution     | `SUB EAX, EAX`   | `XOR EAX, EAX`      |

> [!consider] Detection Challenges
> - **Analysis Difficulty**: Metamorphic code complicates static analysis due to its varying code structure.
> - **Anti-Virus Limitations**: Signature-based detection becomes less effective against metamorphic variants.
> - **Behavioral Analysis**: Security solutions may focus on detecting malware based on behavior rather than code signatures.
