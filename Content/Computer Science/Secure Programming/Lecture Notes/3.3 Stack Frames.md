> [!idea] Stack and Function Calls
> Stacks are **first in, last out** data structures used to manage function calls. When a function is called, a new **stack frame** is created on the stack. This frame stores important information such as the function's local variables, parameters, and the return address (stored in EIP) for when the function completes.
>
> ### Example Stack Frame:
>
> | Register       | Stack Content                       | Description                                      |
> |----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
> |                | **[Bottom of Stack]**               | The initial values in the current function's stack frame (higher memory address). |
> |                | Parameter 2                         | The second parameter passed to the current function. |
> |                | Parameter 1                         | The first parameter passed to the current function. |
> | EBP →          | Saved Base Pointer                  | The previous function's base pointer, saved to restore the caller's stack frame. |
> | EIP →          | Return address                      | The address to return to after the function ends. |
> |                | Local variable 1                    | The first local variable of the current function.|
> | ESP →          | Local variable 2                    | The second local variable of the current function (lowest memory address). |
> |                | **[Top of Stack]**                  | The most recently pushed value (lowest memory address). |
>
> - **ESP (Stack Pointer)**: Points to the top of the stack, which is the lowest memory address, where the most recent data (like local variables) is stored.
> - **EBP (Base Pointer)**: Points to the saved base pointer, which is higher up in the stack, marking the start of the current function's stack frame.
> - **EIP (Instruction Pointer)**: Points to the return address, which is the address in the caller function that should be executed once the current function returns.
>
> As new functions are called, stack frames grow downwards in memory, with each new frame positioned below the previous one. The stack operates primarily through two operations:
> - **push**: Decreases the stack pointer (ESP) and stores a value at the new ESP location, effectively adding data to the top of the stack.
> - **pop**: Retrieves the value at the current ESP and then increases ESP, removing data from the top of the stack.

> [!example] Stack Operations: Push and Pop
> 
> ### Push Operation
> ```
> ; Before push $eax
> ESP → [ ... ]
>       [ ... ]
>       [ ... ]
> 
> ; After push $eax
> ESP → [ $eax value ]
>       [ ... ]
>       [ ... ]
>       [ ... ]
> ```
> 
> ### Pop Operation
> ```
> ; Before pop $eax
> ESP → [ value ]
>       [ ... ]
>       [ ... ]
> 
> ; After pop $eax
> ESP → [ ... ]
>       [ ... ]
> 
> $eax = value
> ```
> 
> The `push` operation decreases ESP and stores the value at the new location, while `pop` retrieves the value at ESP, stores it in the specified register, and then increases ESP.

> [!example] Function Call and Return Process
> 
> Consider this pseudocode:
> ```c
> int main() {
>     int result = foo(5, 3);
>     return 0;
> }
> 
> int foo(int a, int b) {
>     return a + b;
> }
> ```
> 
>  Assembly Code
> ```assembly
> ; Function call
> push 3                  ; Push second argument (b)
> push 5                  ; Push first argument (a)
> call foo                ; Call function and push return address
> add esp, 8              ; Remove arguments after return
> 
> ; Function prologue (inside foo)
> push ebp                ; Save old base pointer
> mov ebp, esp            ; Set new base pointer
> sub esp, 8              ; Allocate space for local variables (if any)
> 
> ; Function body
> mov eax, [ebp+8]        ; Load first argument (a)
> add eax, [ebp+12]       ; Add second argument (b)
> 
> ; Function epilogue and return
> mov esp, ebp            ; Deallocate local variables
> pop ebp                 ; Restore old base pointer
> ret                     ; Return to caller
> ```
> 
> Explanation
> 
> #### Function Call Process
> 1. **Push arguments**: Place function arguments on the stack in reverse order.
> 2. **Call function**: Transfer control to the called function and push the return address.
> 
> #### Function Prologue
> 3. **Push old EBP**: The callee saves the current base pointer (caller's frame).
> 4. **Set new EBP**: Establish the new stack frame base.
> 5. **Allocate local variables**: Adjust stack pointer for local variables.
> 
> #### Function Body
> 6. **Execute function logic**: Perform the function's operations.
> 
> #### Function Epilogue and Return
> 7. **Store return value**: The result is already in EAX from the addition.
> 8. **Deallocate local variables**: Restore the stack pointer.
> 9. **Restore old EBP**: Retrieve the caller's base pointer.
> 10. **Return to caller**: Pop and jump to the return address.
> 
> #### After Return (in caller)
> 11. **Remove arguments**: The caller adjusts the stack to remove passed arguments.
