> [!motivation] Stack Protection
> How can we **detect potential security breaches before they cause significant damage?** This question led to the development of stack protection mechanisms in computer security.

> [!consider] Mining Canaries: A Historical Analogy
> - Miners used canaries as early warning systems for toxic gas build-up
> - **Canaries, highly sensitive to toxic gases, would start chirping**
> - This alerted miners to evacuate immediately
> - This concept inspired a similar approach in computer security

> [!idea] Stack Canaries
> Stack canaries are **values placed on the stack to detect buffer overflows.**
> 
> Implementation:
> - Generate a random secret value at runtime and store it
> - **Place the canary on the stack below the function return pointer**
> - Check the canary value before function return
> - **If the canary value changes, it indicates potential stack tampering**
> 
> Properties:
> - Unique per program execution, consistent across functions
> - First byte is null to mitigate string-based attacks
> - Adds minimal runtime overhead
> 
> ```
> Example stack layout with canary:
> 
> | Buffer         |
> | Canary Value   | <- Checked before function return
> | Saved EBP      |
> | Return Address |
> | Function Args  |
> ```

> [!example] String-based Attack Mitigation
> Consider a format string vulnerability:
> ```c
> printf(user_input);  // Vulnerable to format string attack
> ```
> If `user_input` is `"%s"`, it will try to print a string from the stack.
> A null byte in the canary prevents it from being treated as a valid string pointer.

> [!consider] Canary Bypass Techniques
> Attackers may attempt to circumvent stack canaries through various methods:
> 
> 1. Leaking the canary:
>    - Use format string attacks to print stack contents
>    - Overwrite the canary with its leaked value
> 
> 2. Bypassing the canary:
>    - Write around the canary (e.g., overwrite return address directly)
>    - Exploit format string vulnerabilities for precise writes
>    - Target heap overflows (don't interact with stack canaries)
> 
> 3. Guessing the canary:
>    - 32-bit systems: ~16 million possibilities (24 bits)
>    - 64-bit systems: Significantly more (56 bits)
>    - Local vs. remote program considerations
> 
> Cryptographic implications:
> - If P=NP is proven true, it could potentially impact the effectiveness of stack canaries
