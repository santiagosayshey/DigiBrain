> [!motivation] Balancing Privileges in Programs
> Many **programs require elevated privileges** (e.g., running as root) to perform specific tasks, such as binding to ports below 1024. However, these programs **also need to execute non-privileged code** for tasks that don't require special permissions. Any vulnerabilities or **bugs in the non-privileged sections of the code can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized elevated privileges**, compromising the security of the entire system.

> [!example] SSH Process Permissions and Potential Abuse
> SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure remote access to a system. Here's an overview of how SSH works:
> 
> 1. The SSH server (`sshd`) listens on port 22 for incoming connections. Since ports below 1024 are privileged, `sshd` must run with root privileges.
> 2. When a user connects, `sshd` forks a new process to handle the user's session. This process also runs with root privileges initially.
> 3. The user provides their credentials, and if the authentication is successful, the SSH server process drops its privileges and assumes the user's identity (UID and GID).
> 4. The user's SSH session continues to run with the user's limited permissions.
> 
> However, the initial SSH process running with root privileges can be a potential target for abuse. If an attacker discovers a vulnerability in the SSH server process, they could exploit it to:
> 
> - Gain unauthorized access to the system
> - Elevate their privileges to root
> - Access, modify, or delete sensitive files and directories
> - Install malware or backdoors
> - Intercept and manipulate network traffic
> 
> The impact of such an attack can be severe, as the attacker gains unrestricted access to the system with the highest level of privileges.

> [!idea] Privilege Separation
> To mitigate the risks associated with processes running with elevated privileges, privilege separation can be applied. Privilege separation involves **splitting a program into two or more processes:**
> 
> 1. A privileged process (monitor) that runs with higher privileges and performs only the necessary privileged tasks.
> 2. One or more unprivileged processes (slaves) that handle the majority of the program's functionality and run with lower privileges.
> 
> The **unprivileged processes communicate with the privileged process to request privileged operations as needed.** This way, if an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the unprivileged process, the damage is limited, and the **attacker cannot directly gain elevated privileges.**
> 
> By applying privilege separation to SSH, the impact of potential vulnerabilities can be minimized, as the majority of the SSH session runs with the user's limited permissions.

> [!example] SSH Privilege Abuse: The RegreSSHion Vulnerability
> In 2022, a vulnerability called "RegreSSHion" (CVE-2022-36367) was discovered in the OpenSSH server. This vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass authentication and directly access the SSH console without providing valid credentials.
> 
> The vulnerability affected OpenSSH versions 7.7 through 9.0 and was caused by an unexpected behavior in the post-authentication process cleanup. Here's how an attacker could exploit RegreSSHion:
> 
> 1. The attacker connects to the SSH server, triggering the creation of a new SSH process running with root privileges.
> 2. During the authentication process, the attacker sends a specific sequence of characters that causes the SSH process to misbehave.
> 3. The SSH process fails to properly clean up the post-authentication process, leaving the attacker with an active SSH session without requiring valid credentials.
> 4. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the system with the privileges of the SSH process, which is running as root.
> 
> With root access, the attacker can perform any malicious actions on the compromised system, such as executing commands, modifying files, or installing malware.
> 
> The RegreSSHion vulnerability demonstrates the potential consequences of a privilege abuse attack when a process running with elevated privileges is compromised. It highlights the importance of keeping software up to date and applying security patches promptly to mitigate such risks.
