> [!motivation] Balancing Privileges in Programs
> Many **programs require elevated privileges** (e.g., running as root) to perform specific tasks, such as binding to ports below 1024. However, these programs **also need to execute non-privileged code** for tasks that don't require special permissions. Any vulnerabilities or **bugs in the non-privileged sections of the code can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized elevated privileges**, compromising the security of the entire system.

> [!example] SSH Process Permissions and Potential Abuse
> SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure remote access to a system. Here's an overview of how SSH works:
> 
> 1. The SSH server (`sshd`) listens on port 22 for incoming connections. Since ports below 1024 are privileged, `sshd` must run with root privileges.
> 2. When a user connects, `sshd` forks a new process to handle the user's session. This process also runs with root privileges initially.
> 3. The user provides their credentials, and if the authentication is successful, the SSH server process drops its privileges and assumes the user's identity (UID and GID).
> 4. The user's SSH session continues to run with the user's limited permissions.
> 
> However, the initial SSH process running with root privileges can be a potential target for abuse. If an attacker discovers a vulnerability in the SSH server process, they could exploit it to:
> 
> - Gain unauthorized access to the system
> - Elevate their privileges to root
> - Access, modify, or delete sensitive files and directories
> - Install malware or backdoors
> - Intercept and manipulate network traffic
> 
> The impact of such an attack can be severe, as the attacker gains unrestricted access to the system with the highest level of privileges.

> [!idea] Privilege Separation
> To mitigate the risks associated with processes running with elevated privileges, privilege separation can be applied. Privilege separation involves **splitting a program into two or more processes:**
> 
> 1. A privileged process (monitor) that runs with higher privileges and performs only the necessary privileged tasks.
> 2. One or more unprivileged processes (slaves) that handle the majority of the program's functionality and run with lower privileges.
> 
> The **unprivileged processes communicate with the privileged process to request privileged operations as needed.** This way, if an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the unprivileged process, the damage is limited, and the **attacker cannot directly gain elevated privileges.**
> 
> By applying privilege separation to SSH, the impact of potential vulnerabilities can be minimized, as the majority of the SSH session runs with the user's limited permissions.


> [!example] SSH Privilege Abuse: The RegreSSHion Vulnerability (CVE-2022-36367)
> The RegreSSHion vulnerability in OpenSSH **exploits a race condition in the post-authentication process cleanup, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access** to the SSH console.
> 
> The race condition occurs between two competing processes:
> 
> 1. The SSH server process trying to clean up the post-authentication state.
> 2. The attacker's process sending a specifically crafted sequence of messages.
> 
> Here's how the race condition leads to the authentication bypass:
> 
> 1. The attacker connects to the SSH server and initiates the authentication process.
> 2. The attacker sends a malformed message that triggers a crash or unexpected behavior in the SSH server process.
> 3. The SSH server process starts cleaning up the post-authentication state, including releasing resources and resetting variables.
> 4. Before the cleanup process completes, the attacker quickly sends another message to the SSH server.
> 5. The race condition occurs:
>    - If the attacker's message arrives before the cleanup process finishes, it can interfere with the cleanup and leave the SSH server in an inconsistent state.
>    - The attacker's message may overwrite certain variables or prevent the complete reset of the authentication state.
> 6. As a result of the race condition, the SSH server may consider the attacker as authenticated, even though no valid credentials were provided.
> 7. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the SSH console with the privileges of the SSH server process (root).
> 
> The race condition allows the attacker to bypass the authentication process by exploiting the timing window between the cleanup process and the attacker's message. By sending the message at the right moment, the attacker can interfere with the cleanup and trick the SSH server into granting access without proper authentication.
> 
> This vulnerability highlights the importance of properly synchronizing and protecting the post-authentication cleanup process to prevent race conditions that can lead to authentication bypasses and privilege abuse.
