> [!example] Return-to-libc: `rm -rf /`
> Let's explore a more in-depth example of a return-to-libc attack that aims to execute the command `rm -rf /` using the `system()` function from libc.
> 
> Consider a vulnerable program with a buffer overflow:
> ```c
> void vulnerable_function(char *input) {
>     char buffer[100];
>     strcpy(buffer, input);
> }
> ```
> 
> The attacker's goal is to overwrite the return address on the stack to point to the `system()` function in libc, with the argument `"rm -rf /"`.
> 
> Here's how the stack would look before the overflow:
> ```
> +------------------+
> |  Return Address  |
> +------------------+
> |    Saved EBP     |
> +------------------+
> |   buffer[100]    |
> +------------------+
> ```
> 
> The attacker crafts a malicious input that includes:
> 1. A long string to overflow the buffer and overwrite the saved EBP and return address.
> 2. The address of the `system()` function in libc.
> 3. A dummy value for the return address after `system()`.
> 4. The address of the string `"rm -rf /"` as the argument to `system()`.
> 
> After the overflow, the stack looks like this:
> ```
> +------------------------+
> |  Address of "rm -rf /" |
> +------------------------+
> | Dummy return address   |
> +------------------------+
> |  Address of system()   |
> +------------------------+
> |   Overflowed buffer    |
> +------------------------+
> ```
> 
> When the `vulnerable_function()` returns, it will:
> 1. Jump to the address of `system()` in libc.
> 2. Use the address of `"rm -rf /"` as the argument to `system()`.
> 3. Execute the command `rm -rf /`, potentially causing significant harm to the system.
> 
> This example demonstrates how return-to-libc attacks can be used to execute arbitrary commands by reusing existing code in the C standard library, bypassing DEP/NX protection.
