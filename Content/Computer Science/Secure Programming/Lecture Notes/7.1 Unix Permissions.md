> [!motivation] Limiting User Access
> In a multi-user system, it's crucial to ensure that users can only read, write, and execute specific files and directories based on their roles and permissions. This helps maintain the security, privacy, and integrity of the system by preventing unauthorized access and modifications.

> [!idea] UID and GID
> - **UID (User ID)**: A unique identifier assigned to each user account in a Unix-like system. It is used to determine the ownership and permissions of files and directories associated with that user.
> - **GID (Group ID)**: An identifier assigned to a group of users. It allows multiple users to share the same permissions for specific files and directories.
> - The combination of UID and GID is used to control access rights and enforce security policies on a per-user and per-group basis.

> [!example] File Permissions
> The `ls` command can be used to display the permissions, ownership, and other attributes of files and directories. Here's an example:
> 
> ```
> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 187120 04 Sep 13:30 /bin/ls
> ```
> 
> - The first character indicates the file type (**-** for regular file, **d** for directory).
> - The next three characters (**rwx**) represent the permissions for the file owner (UID).
> - The following three characters (**r-x**) represent the permissions for the group owner (GID).
> - The last three characters (**r-x**) represent the permissions for other users.
>   - **r**: read permission
>   - **w**: write permission
>   - **x**: execute permission
>   - **-**: no permission
> - In this example, the file is owned by the user **root** and belongs to the group **wheel**.

> [!consider] Special Permissions (SUID, SGID)
> - **SUID (Set User ID)**: When the SUID bit is set on an executable file, it allows the file to be executed with the permissions of the file owner (UID) rather than the user executing it. This is represented by **s** in the owner's execute permission (**rwsr-xr-x**).
> - **SGID (Set Group ID)**: Similar to SUID, the SGID bit allows the file to be executed with the permissions of the group owner (GID). It is represented by **s** in the group's execute permission (**rwxr-sr-x**).
> - If the execute permission is not set for the owner (SUID) or group (SGID), the special permission bit is represented by an uppercase **S** instead of **s**.
> 
> These special permissions are used to grant temporary elevated privileges to specific programs, allowing them to perform restricted operations on behalf of the user.
