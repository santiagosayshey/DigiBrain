> [!motivation] The Illusion of Abstraction
> In modern computing, we often work under the assumption of a simplified, abstracted model of hardware. Consider this basic program:
> ```c
> basesquared = base * base
> sidesquare = side * side
> hypotenuse = sqrt(basesquared + sidesquare)
> ```
> While we might assume it simply calculates `basesquared` first, the reality depends on the underlying hardware architecture. This discrepancy between our programming model and hardware reality raises a critical question: **What happens when our virtualization breaks, and we are left to the mercy of the actual hardware?**

> This gap between abstraction and reality creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited through micro-architectural attacks, challenging our assumptions about program behavior and security.
