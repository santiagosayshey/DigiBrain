consider this basic program
```
basesquared = base*base
sidesquare = side*side
hypotenuse = sqrt(basesquared+hypotenuse)
```
what is the first thing that the program does? You might say that it calculates the base squared. 

this is wrong.

why?

because it depends on the hardware. the architecture of the system. We act in a
