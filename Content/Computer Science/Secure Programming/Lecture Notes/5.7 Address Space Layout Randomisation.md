> [!consider] ASLR Implementation Details
> - ASLR is implemented at the kernel level, making it transparent to safe applications.
> - The randomization occurs on page boundaries, typically 4KiB pages.
> - On 32-bit systems, ASLR provides 2^20 possible page arrangements, while 64-bit systems offer 2^36 possibilities.
> - The increased entropy in 64-bit systems makes brute-force attacks more challenging.

> [!idea] Breaking ASLR
> Attackers may attempt to break ASLR through two main approaches:
> 1. Address Leaks:
>    - **Relative addresses between segments remain fixed, potentially undoing the randomization.**
>      - For example, if an attacker can leak the address of a function in a library (e.g., `printf` in `libc`), they can calculate the base address of the library.
>      - With the base address known, the attacker can determine the addresses of other functions in the library, effectively bypassing ASLR for that library.
>    - Leaking a single address can allow attackers to calculate the base address and bypass ASLR.
>      - Techniques like format string vulnerabilities or memory disclosure bugs can be used to leak addresses.
>      - Once an address is leaked, the attacker can use the fixed relative offsets to calculate the addresses of other important memory locations.
> 2. Brute-Force:
>    - On 32-bit systems, the limited randomization entropy (2^20) makes brute-force attacks feasible.
>      - ASLR on 32-bit systems typically randomizes the base address of memory regions at a granularity of 4KB pages.
>      - With only 20 bits of entropy, an attacker needs to guess from roughly 1 million possibilities, which can be done in a reasonable amount of time.
>      - If an attacker can crash and restart the program repeatedly, they can eventually guess the correct memory layout and bypass ASLR.
>    - 64-bit systems with 2^36 possible arrangements are more resilient to brute-force attempts.
>      - ASLR on 64-bit systems provides a much larger address space and higher entropy (36 bits) for memory region randomization.
>      - This increased entropy makes brute-force attacks significantly harder, as the number of possible memory layouts is exponentially larger (2^36 â‰ˆ 68 billion).
>      - However, if the attacker has a way to efficiently validate their guesses (e.g., through a side-channel), even 64-bit ASLR can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, albeit requiring more time and resources.
