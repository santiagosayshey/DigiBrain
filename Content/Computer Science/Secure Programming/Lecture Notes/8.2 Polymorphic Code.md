> [!idea] Polymorphic Code
> Polymorphic code is a technique used to evade malware signature identification.
> 
> **Key aspects:**
> - Injects encrypted code inside the virus
> - Includes the key and decryptor with the virus
> - **Goal:** Make the virus appear different each time, not to prevent code reading
> 
> **Main takeaway:** Using different initialization vectors or keys makes the virus look unique in each instance, avoiding detection
> 
> **Advanced feature:** Can include encrypted propagation code
> - Instructs to use a new key for virus encryption
> - Bundles this with the decryptor code
