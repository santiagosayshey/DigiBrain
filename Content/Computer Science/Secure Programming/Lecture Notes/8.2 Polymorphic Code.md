idea - Polymorphic code
- get around malware signature identification by injecting encryped code inside the virus, including the key and decryptor
- aim is not to prevent anyone from reading the codem but evade detection by making the virus look different
- table to show original virus - contains main virus code, and polymorphic virus - contains decryptor code, key and encryped virus code, and another polymorphic virus with different keys, etc
- main takeaway is that we can use a diffferent IV, or key or whatrever to make the virus look different every time and avoid detection
- can even include encryped propagation code
