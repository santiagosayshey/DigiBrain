> [!idea] Polymorphic Code
> Polymorphic code is a malware evasion technique that **changes the appearance of malicious code** without altering its functionality.
> 
> **Key mechanics:**
> - **Encrypts the main virus code** using different keys or initialization vectors for each instance
> - **Includes a decryption routine** that remains constant but may be obfuscated
> - **Generates unique encryption keys** for each new virus copy
> 
> **How it works:**
> 1. The virus encrypts its payload and propagation instructions
> 2. It attaches a decryption routine and the unique key
> 3. When executed, it decrypts and runs the main virus code
> 4. For propagation, it re-encrypts the payload with a new key
> 
> This process creates **variable virus signatures** while maintaining identical malicious behavior, effectively evading signature-based detection methods.

> [!consider] Defending Against Polymorphic Code
> Two main strategies for detecting polymorphic malware:
> 
> **1. Add a signature for detecting decryptor code**
> - Strategy: Create antivirus signatures that match the decryptor portion of the malware
> - Rationale: Decryptor remains constant across variants
> - Pros/Cons:
>   - Less code to match in signatures
>   - Produces more false positives
>   - Decryptor can be scattered across different parts of memory, complicating detection
> 
> **2. Safely check if the code performs decryption**
> - Strategy: Analyze the behavior of suspected code to identify decryption activities
> - Implementation methods:
>   - Execute in sandbox
>   - Analyse without executing (static analysis)
> - Challenges:
>   - Hard to differentiate from similar legitimate activities (e.g., decompressing zips)
>   - Determining appropriate duration for sandbox execution
