> [!motivation] Writing to Protected Files
> In a Linux system, certain files like `/etc/passwd` are protected and can only be modified by privileged users or programs. However, **a race condition vulnerability called TOCTTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) can be exploited to bypass these restrictions and write to protected files.**

> [!idea] The TOCTTOU Race Condition
> The TOCTTOU race condition occurs when **a privileged program checks a file's permissions (Time-of-Check) and later opens the file for writing (Time-of-Use)**. If an attacker can change the file reference between these two steps, they can trick the program into writing to an unintended file.

> [!example] Exploiting the TOCTTOU Vulnerability
> Consider a privileged program that writes to a file in the `/tmp` directory:
> 1. The program uses the `access()` system call to check if the real user ID has write access to `/tmp/x`.
> 2. If the check passes, the program uses `open()` to open the file for writing. `open()` checks the effective user ID, which is 0 (root), so the file will always be opened.
> 
> To exploit this, the attacker runs two programs concurrently:
> - **Attack Program:**
>   - A1: Make `/tmp/x` point to a file owned by the attacker.
>   - A2: Make `/tmp/x` point to `/etc/passwd`.
> - **Vulnerable Program:**
>   - V1: Check user's permission on `/tmp/x` using `access()`.
>   - V2: Open the file using `open()`.
> 
> The attack program repeatedly switches the `/tmp/x` symlink between the attacker's file and `/etc/passwd`, while the vulnerable program checks permissions and opens the file.

>     Vulnerable Program->>Vulnerable Program: V2: Open /tmp/x for writing
> ```

> [!consider] Key Takeaway
> The TOCTTOU race condition allows an attacker to bypass file permission checks by exploiting the time gap between the check and the actual file operation, tricking the program into modifying unintended files.

> [!idea] Countermeasures Against TOCTTOU Race Conditions
> Several techniques can be employed to mitigate or prevent TOCTTOU race conditions:
> 
> 1. **Atomic Operations**: Eliminate the window between the check and use steps by combining them into a single, indivisible operation. This ensures that the file cannot be changed between the check and the actual file operation.
> 
> 2. **Repeated Check and Use**: Repeatedly perform the check and use steps in a loop until they refer to the same file. While this doesn't eliminate the race condition, it makes it more difficult for an attacker to win the race.
> 
> 3. **Sticky Symlink Protection**: Use the `sticky` bit on directories to prevent users from deleting or renaming files they don't own. This makes it harder for attackers to change the symlink to point to a different file.
> 
> 4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that a program does not use more privileges than what is needed for the task at hand. If a program only needs to write to specific files, it should not run with root privileges that allow it to write to any file.

> [!idea] Background: Memory Management and Copy-On-Write (COW)
> - In Linux, each program has its own virtual memory space, which is managed by the operating system.
> - When a program wants to access a file, it can use a technique called "memory mapping" (`mmap`) to load the file into its memory space. This allows the program to access the file as if it were in RAM, making it faster to read and write.
> - Copy-On-Write (COW) is a clever technique used by the operating system to save memory when multiple programs want to access the same file.
>   - Instead of creating separate copies of the file for each program, the operating system lets them share the same memory space as long as they only read from it.
>   - If a program tries to write to this shared memory space, the operating system will automatically create a private copy of the data just for that program, so the original data remains unchanged for other programs.
>   - This way, multiple programs can share the same memory efficiently, and the operating system only needs to create copies when necessary.

> [!idea] The Dirty COW Vulnerability
> - The Dirty COW vulnerability is a bug in the Linux kernel that allows an attacker to bypass the Copy-On-Write protection and modify files that are supposed to be read-only.
> - Normally, if a program tries to write to a read-only memory space, the operating system should create a private copy of the data for that program (triggering a COW). However, due to this bug, an attacker can trick the system into writing to the original read-only memory without creating a copy.
> - This means that an attacker can modify files that they shouldn't have permission to change, like sensitive system files.

> [!example] The Race Condition in Dirty COW
> The race condition in the Dirty COW vulnerability occurs between Thread A (`madvise` thread), Thread B (write thread), and the operating system's COW mechanism. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens:
> 
> 1. The main program memory-maps the read-only file into its virtual memory space using `mmap`.
> 
> 2. Thread A repeatedly calls `madvise` with the `MADV_DONTNEED` flag on the memory-mapped region:
>    - `madvise` is a system call that allows a program to give advice to the operating system about how it intends to use a certain memory region.
>    - The `MADV_DONTNEED` flag tells the operating system that the program doesn't need the contents of the specified memory region anymore, and the operating system can free up those memory pages if needed.
>    - By repeatedly calling `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`, Thread A is essentially telling the operating system to forget about the contents of the memory-mapped region, causing the original file contents to be discarded.
> 
> 3. Simultaneously, Thread B repeatedly tries to write to the memory-mapped region:
>    - Normally, when a program tries to write to a read-only memory region, the operating system triggers a COW operation, creating a private copy of the memory page for the program to write to, leaving the original read-only memory unchanged.
>    - However, due to the race condition, if Thread B manages to write to the memory region after Thread A has discarded the original contents using `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` but before the operating system has a chance to create a private copy (COW), the write will actually modify the original read-only memory.
> 
> 4. The race condition occurs because:
>    - Thread A is repeatedly discarding the original contents of the memory region using `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)`, causing the operating system to forget about the contents and delay the COW operation.
>    - Thread B is repeatedly attempting to write to the memory region, hoping to slip its write operation in before the operating system realizes it needs to perform a COW operation.
>    - If Thread B's write operation occurs after Thread A has discarded the original contents but before the operating system has created a private copy, the write will directly modify the original read-only memory, bypassing the COW protection.
> 
> 5. If Thread B wins the race and successfully writes to the read-only memory without triggering a COW, the original read-only file will be modified, even though it should have been protected.
> 
> The key to the Dirty COW exploit is the timing of the `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` calls in Thread A and the write operations in Thread B. By repeatedly discarding the original contents and attempting to write, the exploit increases the chances of Thread B winning the race and modifying the read-only memory without triggering a COW operation.

> [!consider] Why the Race Condition Occurs
> The root cause of the Dirty COW vulnerability lies in how the Linux kernel handles the combination of `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` and write operations on private memory mappings.
> 
> When a private memory mapping is created using `mmap` with the `MAP_PRIVATE` flag, the kernel defers the actual creation of a private copy until the program tries to write to the memory region, optimizing performance and memory usage.
> 
> However, the kernel's handling of `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` on private mappings had a flaw. When `MADV_DONTNEED` is called on a private mapping, the kernel discards the original contents and marks the pages as uninitialized, but it doesn't properly update the state of the private mapping. This causes a race condition window where a write operation can modify the original read-only memory before the kernel realizes it needs to create a private copy.
> 
> The combination of the deferred COW mechanism and the improper handling of `MADV_DONTNEED` on private mappings is what enables the Dirty COW exploit to bypass the read-only protection and modify the original file contents.


> [!consider] Impact and Mitigation
> - The Dirty COW vulnerability is dangerous because it allows attackers to modify files they shouldn't have permission to change, potentially giving them control over the system.
> - To fix this problem, the Linux kernel developers released patches that close the vulnerability. Users should update their Linux systems to a version that includes these patches.
> - Additionally, any programs or libraries that might be affected by this vulnerability should also be updated to patched versions.
