> [!motivation] Injection Flaws
**User input can be weaponized** for malicious purposes by sending untrusted, harmful data to an interpreter.
> 
> - **Injection Attacks**:
>   - SQL injection can manipulate database queries
>   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) injects malicious scripts into web pages
>   - Command injection executes unauthorized system commands
> 
> - **Consequences**:
>   - Data breaches exposing sensitive information
>   - Unauthorized access to systems
>   - Manipulation or destruction of data
>   - Service disruptions and system crashes
> 
> **Real-world impacts**:
> - The 2011 Sony PlayStation Network breach, caused by SQL injection, exposed data of 77 million users
> - In 2017, a simple XSS vulnerability in TweetDeck allowed attackers to create self-retweeting tweets
> 
> To mitigate these risks, we need robust **input sanitization** techniques. This process helps ensure that user input is safe before it's processed by our systems, significantly reducing the attack surface.
I understand. I'll provide a more concise version of the vulnerable code, followed by a sanitized version after the idea callout. Here's the revised structure:

> [!example] SQL Injection Attack: Bypassing Login in Node.js
> This example demonstrates how **a malicious actor can exploit unsanitized input** in a Node.js application:
>
> Vulnerable Node.js code:
> ```javascript
> // ... (database connection and Express setup)
>
> app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
>   const { username, password } = req.body;
>   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}'`;
>   
>   // Execute query and handle response
>   // ...
> });
> ```
>
> Attacker's input:
> ```json
> {
>   "username": "admin' --",
>   "password": "anything"
> }
> ```
>
> Resulting query:
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything'
> ```
>
> **The attack succeeds because**:
> - The `--` comments out the rest of the query
> - The attacker logs in as 'admin' without knowing the password

> [!idea] Input Sanitization
> Input sanitization is the process of **cleaning and validating user input** to prevent malicious data from entering a system.
> 
> Key Aspects:
> - Validation: Ensuring input meets expected format and criteria
> - Escaping: Converting special characters to safe representations
> - Stripping: Removing potentially harmful elements from input
> 
> Common Techniques:
> - **Whitelisting allowed characters or inputs**
> - **Using parameterized queries** for database operations
> - **Encoding output** to prevent XSS attacks
> - Implementing strict type checking
> 
> Benefits:
> - **Reduces risk of injection attacks**
> - Improves overall system security and stability
> - Helps maintain data integrity
> 
> **Effective input sanitization** is a critical component of a robust security strategy, working alongside other measures like input validation and output encoding.

> [!example] Sanitized Login in Node.js
> This example shows the same login functionality with **proper input sanitization**:
>
> ```javascript
> // ... (database connection and Express setup)
>
> app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
>   const { username, password } = req.body;
>   
>   // Use parameterized query
>   const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?';
>   
>   db.query(query, [username, password], (err, results) => {
>     // Handle query results
>     // ...
>   });
> });
> ```
>
> **This approach prevents SQL injection by**:
> - Using parameterized queries to separate SQL logic from user input
> - Allowing the database driver to properly escape special characters
>
> The attacker's input is now treated as literal values, not part of the SQL syntax.
