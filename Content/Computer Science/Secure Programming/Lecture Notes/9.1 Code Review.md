> **Perfect code is impossible**, making flawless development unachievable.
> 
> - **Development Journey**: Typically a bumpy journey with occasional backtracking.
> - **Cost of Issues**: Delayed issue detection increases the cost of fixes.
> - **Cost Reduction Strategies**:
>   - Static analysis
>   - Unit testing
>   - Code inspections
>   - Peer review
>   - Quality Assurance (QA)
>   - Pre-test defect removal and prevention

> [!idea] Manual Secure Code Review
>
> A **manual secure code review** involves a constructive examination of another developer's code to identify and address security flaws.
> 
> - **Objectives**:
>   - Identify security flaws related to features and design.
>   - Audit source code to ensure security controls are properly implemented and invoked.
> - **Methods**:
>   - **Pair Programming**:
>     - One person writes code while the other reviews it concurrently.
>   - **Over the Shoulder**:
>     - Feedback is provided after a feature is completed, differing from pair programming by not being simultaneous.
>   - **Over the Wall**:
>     - Code is handed off between teams or individuals without direct collaboration.
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Ensures multiple people understand the code.
>   - Encourages authors to articulate and document their code.
>   - Helps junior developers learn to write better code.

> [!example] How to Perform a Secure Code Review
>
> **Steps to Conduct a Secure Code Review**:
> 
> 1. **Identify Reviewers**:
>    - Select individuals with relevant expertise and understanding of the codebase.
> 2. **Prepare for Review**:
>    - Gather business rules, context, sensitive data information, user roles, design documents, and the code itself.
> 3. **Conduct the Review**:
>    - Systematically examine the code for security vulnerabilities and compliance with standards.
> 4. **Write a Report**:
>    - Document findings, including identified issues and recommendations for fixes.
> 5. **Example Application**:
>    - Review a login feature by assessing input validation, authentication mechanisms, and data handling practices.

> [!consider] Code Review and SDLC
>
> **Integration of Code Reviews within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**:
> 
> - **What is SDLC**:
>   - A framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.
> - **Stages for Code Reviews**:
>   - **Pre-Commit**:
>     - Reviews conducted before code is merged into the main codebase to catch issues early.
>   - **Post-Commit**:
>     - Reviews done after code integration to ensure ongoing quality and security.
>   - **During Audits**:
>     - Comprehensive reviews conducted periodically to assess overall code health and compliance.
> - **Expansion**:
>   - Incorporating automated tools alongside manual reviews.
>   - Ensuring continuous feedback and improvement throughout the SDLC phases.

> [!idea] Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) - OWASP Version
>
> The **OWASP Software Development Lifecycle** integrates security practices into each phase of the SDLC.
> 
> - **Phases**:
>   - **Requirements**:
>     - Define security requirements alongside functional requirements.
>   - **Design**:
>     - Incorporate security architecture and threat modeling.
>   - **Implementation**:
>     - Conduct secure coding practices and peer reviews.
>   - **Verification**:
>     - Perform security testing, including code reviews and penetration testing.
>   - **Maintenance**:
>     - Continuously monitor and address security vulnerabilities post-deployment.
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Embeds security throughout the development process.
>   - Reduces vulnerabilities and enhances software robustness.

> [!summary] Summary
>
> - **Motivation**: Perfect code is unattainable, necessitating strategies to manage and reduce development issues.
> - **Manual Secure Code Review**: A methodical approach to identifying and addressing security flaws through various review techniques.
> - **How to Perform**: Involves selecting reviewers, preparing materials, conducting the review, and documenting findings.
> - **Code Review and SDLC**: Integrates reviews into different SDLC stages to maintain code quality and security.
> - **OWASP SDLC**: A security-focused framework that incorporates best practices at each phase of software development.
