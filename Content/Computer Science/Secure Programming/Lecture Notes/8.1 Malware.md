> [!idea] Malware
> Malware is software covertly inserted into a system to compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability (CIA) of data, applications, or operating systems, or to disrupt or annoy users.
> - **Common Actions**:
>   - Delete files
>   - Send spam emails
>   - Launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
>   - Steal information
>   - Record user inputs (keylogging, screen capture, webcam capture)
>   - Encrypt files and demand ransom (ransomware)
>   - Physically damage machines
> - **Self-Replication**: Some malware can copy itself to infect other machines.

> [!idea] Viruses and Worms
> Viruses and worms are self-propagating malware. **Viruses** require user action to spread, such as opening an infected file, while **worms** do not and can spread autonomously across networks.
> - **Characteristics**:
>   - **Viruses**:
>     - Alter existing code
>     - Need user interaction to activate
>   - **Worms**:
>     - Exploit vulnerabilities to spread automatically
> - **Components**:
>   - **Vector**: Method of propagation
>   - **Trigger**: Condition that activates the payload
>   - **Payload**: Malicious action performed

> [!example] Virus Structure
> An example virus might infect executable files (vector), activate when the file is run (trigger), and delete system files (payload).
> - **Vector**: Infected executable files
> - **Trigger**: Execution of the infected file
> - **Payload**: Deleting system files

> [!idea] Botnets
> A botnet is a network of compromised machines controlled by a master, typically created using malware.
> - **Capabilities**:
>   - Launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
>   - Perform cryptocurrency mining
>   - Send spam emails
> - **Master Control**: The attacker leverages numerous compromised machines to amplify operations.

> [!consider] Propagation Strategies
> Malware seeks opportunities to infect systems through various methods.
> - **Infection Points**:
>   - Startup programs
>   - Application execution
>   - Opening email attachments
> - **Expansion Techniques**:
>   - Emailing itself to contacts
>   - Exploiting network vulnerabilities

> [!consider] Detection Strategies
> Detecting malware involves identifying known patterns or behaviors.
> - **Signature-Based Detection**: Uses known malware signatures to identify threats.
> - **Antivirus Software**: Scans systems to detect and remove malware.

> [!consider] The Arms Race
> Attackers and defenders are in a continuous battle.
> - **Attackers**:
>   - Develop evasion techniques
>   - React quickly to detection methods
> - **Defenders**:
>   - Enhance detection strategies
>   - Anticipate new threats
> - **Dynamic Advantage**: Attackers often have the upper hand, adapting faster than antivirus solutions can update.
