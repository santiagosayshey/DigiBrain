idea - malware
- a program that is covertly inserted into a system with the intent of compromising the CIA of the victim's data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the data
- it can:
	- delete files
	- send spam email
	- launch a dos attack
	- steal information
	- record user inputs (keylogging, screen capture, webcam capture)
	- encrypts files and demands a ransom to decrypt them
	- physically damages machines
- can be self replicating - copy itself and infect another machine


idea - viruses and worms (two call-outs)
- self propagating
- viruses require user input while worms do not.
- alters existing code usually
- vector, trigger, payload

example virus
- what is the vector trigger and payload?

idea - botnets
- a set of compromised machines controlled by a master. Usually made using malware
- Master now has tons of resources to what they want (mining, dos, etc)

consider - propagation strategies
- infect code that runs on startup, when the user runs an app, opens attachment, etc
- look for more opportunities to infect more systems (email!!

consider - detection based strategies
- signatures based detection
- antivirus
