idea - malware
- a program that is covertly inserted into a system with the intent of compromising the CIA of the victim's data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the data
- it can:
	- delete files
	- send spam email
	- launch a dos attack
	- steal information
	- record user inputs (keylogging, screen capture, webcam capture)
	- encrypts files and demands a ransom to decrypt them
	- physically damages machines
- can be self replicating - copy itself and infect another machine

perhaps for the next part, we can have a tbale of all these malwares intstead of multiple callouts please?
idea - viruses and worms
- self propagating
