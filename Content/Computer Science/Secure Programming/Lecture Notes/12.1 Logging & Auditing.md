> [!motivation] Why Logging and Auditing Matter
> - **Security incidents require evidence** for investigation and recovery
> - Organizations need to **track and monitor system activities**
> - Three key purposes:
>   - Deter unauthorized behavior through accountability
>   - Enable forensics and incident reconstruction
>   - Monitor for problems in real-time

> [!idea] Logging Fundamentals
> **System Logs** record status and error conditions from:
> - Kernel and accounting systems
> - System services 
> - Application and server software
> 
> **Common Log Locations**:
> 
> | System Type | Primary Location | Configuration |
> |-------------|------------------|---------------|
> | UNIX | /var/log, /var/adm | /etc/syslog.conf |
> | Windows | Event Viewer | Local Security Policy |
> 
> **Key Log Files**:
> - auth.log: Authorization attempts
> - syslog: System messages
> - messages: Program/kernel logs
> - lastlog: Login records
> - wtmp: Login accounting data

> [!consider] Log Design Principles
> **Effective Logging Requirements**:
> - Each entry should be self-contained
> - Time stamps must be consistent
> - Include necessary context without excess data
> - Use standardized formats
> 
> **What Not to Log**:
> - Plain text passwords or keys
> - Sensitive company information
> - Personal identifiable information
> - Protected health information

> [!idea] Log Sanitization
> **Process of cleaning sensitive data from logs**:
> - **Pre-write sanitization**: Clean before writing to log
>   - Protects from admin abuse
>   - Requires advance planning
> - **Post-write sanitization**: Clean after writing
>   - Enables forensic analysis
>   - Requires secure log storage

> [!example] Common Log Formats
> **Standard Log Format Example**:
> ```plaintext
> 127.0.0.1 user-id frank [29/Jul/2024:13:55:36 -0500] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2326
> ```
> 
> **Components**:
> - IP address
> - User identifier
> - Username
> - Timestamp
> - Request type
> - Response code
> - Response size

> [!example] Monitoring Infrastructure
> **Network Security Monitoring (NSM) Components**:
> 
> | Component | Purpose |
> |-----------|----------|
> | IDS | Detect threats |
> | IPS | Block threats |
> | SIEM | Aggregate/analyze |
> | Log Management | Store/retrieve |
> 
> **IDS vs IPS**:
> - IDS: Passive monitoring, lower risk
> - IPS: Active blocking, higher maintenance

> [!consider] Advanced Security Monitoring
> **Layer Defense Strategy**:
> - Implement both host and network monitoring
> - Use SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic
> - Deploy SIEM for correlation
> 
> **Integration Requirements**:
> - Centralized log collection
> - Automated analysis
> - Real-time alerting
> - Long-term storage
> - Forensic support
