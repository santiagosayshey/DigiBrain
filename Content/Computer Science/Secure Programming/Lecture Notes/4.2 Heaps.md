> [!idea] Computer Memory Layout
> Computer memory is organized into different segments:
> - **Code segment**: Contains executable instructions
> - **Data segment**: Stores initialized global and static variables
> - **BSS (Block Started by Symbol)**: Holds uninitialized global and static variables
> - **Heap**: Dynamic memory allocation area
>   - Starts immediately after the BSS segment
>   - Grows upward as memory is allocated
> - **Break**: 
>   - Points to the end of the heap
>   - Can be adjusted using system calls (e.g., brk, sbrk) to allocate/deallocate heap memory
>   - Moves upward as heap grows, downward as heap shrinks
> - **Stack**: Manages function calls and local variables
>   - Starts at the high end of memory
>   - Grows downward

> This diagram illustrates the layout from low memory addresses (left) to high memory addresses (right). The heap grows upward (rightward), with the break pointing to its end. The stack grows downward (leftward) from high memory addresses.

> [!consider] Memory Fragmentation and Management
> When memory chunks are freed, it can lead to **fragmented memory** within the heap. This fragmentation can cause inefficient memory usage and potential performance issues.
> 
> **What happens after freeing memory chunks:**
> - Freed memory remains in place, creating "holes" in the heap
> - These holes can lead to external fragmentation
> - Subsequent allocations may not fit into available free spaces efficiently
> 
> **Methods to deal with fragmented memory:**
> 
> | Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
> |--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
> | **Free Lists** | Maintain lists of free memory blocks | - Fast allocation for common sizes<br>- Reduces fragmentation for frequently used sizes | - Overhead in maintaining multiple lists<br>- May not handle varying sizes efficiently |
> | **Coalescing** | Merge adjacent free blocks | - Reduces fragmentation<br>- Simplifies memory layout | - Can be time-consuming<br>- May need to traverse memory to find adjacent free blocks |
> | **Compaction** | Relocate used memory to one end, free to other | - Eliminates fragmentation<br>- Creates large contiguous free space | - Expensive operation<br>- Requires updating all pointers |
> | **Garbage Collection** | Automatically identify and free unused memory | - Reduces memory leaks<br>- Simplifies memory management for developers | - Can introduce pauses in program execution<br>- Overhead in tracking object references |
> | **Memory Pools** | Pre-allocate fixed-size blocks for specific types | - Fast allocation and deallocation<br>- Reduces fragmentation for specific sizes | - Can waste memory if pool sizes are not well-tuned<br>- Not flexible for varying allocation sizes |
> **Tracking free memory:**
> - **Bitmap**: Use a bit array to represent allocated/free status of memory blocks
> - **Linked list**: Connect free blocks in a list structure
>   - Each free block contains metadata (size, pointers to next/previous blocks)
>   - Lists can be sorted (e.g., by size) for efficient allocation
>   - Sorting smallest to largest helps find best-fit blocks
>   - Sorting largest to smallest aids in finding blocks for large allocations
> - **Tree-based**: Organize free blocks in a tree for efficient searching
> 
> **Use in memory allocation functions:**
> - **malloc/free**: Use these lists to find and return free blocks
> - **new/delete**: Often wrappers around malloc/free, utilizing the same lists
> - These functions traverse the lists to find suitable blocks, update list structure when allocating or freeing memory
