> [!motivation] The Need for Secure Microarchitectures
> Modern computer systems rely on complex microarchitectures to optimize performance through features like caching, speculative execution, and out-of-order execution. However, these same features can **inadvertently create covert channels that attackers exploit to leak sensitive data**, compromising system security. Understanding and mitigating these vulnerabilities is crucial for designing secure hardware and software systems.

> [!idea] Covert Channels in Microarchitectures
> Covert channels are **unintended communication paths that allow information transfer in violation of security policies**. In microarchitectures, these channels arise from shared resources like caches, branch predictors, and memory buses. By manipulating and measuring the state of these shared resources, attackers can transmit data covertly, bypassing traditional security boundaries.
> - **Cache-Based Channels**: Attackers can encode data in cache access patterns, causing measurable differences in access times that receivers can observe.
> - **Branch Predictor Channels**: The branch predictor's state can be influenced to convey information, as mispredictions affect execution time.
> - **Memory Bus Contention**: Varying levels of memory bus contention can be used to signal data, as it impacts memory access latencies.
