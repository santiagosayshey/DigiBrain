> [!motivation] Balancing Privileges in Programs
> Many **programs require elevated privileges** (e.g., running as root) to perform specific tasks, such as binding to ports below 1024. However, these programs **also need to execute non-privileged code** for tasks that don't require special permissions. Any vulnerabilities or **bugs in the non-privileged sections of the code can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized elevated privileges**, compromising the security of the entire system.
