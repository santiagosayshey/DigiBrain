> [!motivation] Balancing Privileges in Programs
> Many **programs require elevated privileges** (e.g., running as root) to perform specific tasks, such as binding to ports below 1024. However, these programs **also need to execute non-privileged code** for tasks that don't require special permissions. Any vulnerabilities or **bugs in the non-privileged sections of the code can potentially be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized elevated privileges**, compromising the security of the entire system.

example - ssh
- ssh server expected to run on port 22, and ran as root
- when a connection is recieved, it forks and creates a login process
- after auth, the process drops privs and becomes the login shell
- why is this good?

idea - privelage separation
- break software into two processes - a privelaged monitor and an unprivelaged slave
- the slave does the bulk of the work
-  the monitor performs privelaged operations on behalf of the slave
