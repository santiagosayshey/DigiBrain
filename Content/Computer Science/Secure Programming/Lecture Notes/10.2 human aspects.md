> [!motivation] The Human Security Challenge
> Organizations **focus heavily on technical security** - firewalls, encryption, access controls. But while they spend massive resources securing technology, they **often overlook the most critical vulnerability: human behavior.**
>
> This gap exists because:
> - Technical solutions are easier to implement than changing human behavior
> - We can measure technical security, but human security is harder to quantify
> - There's a misconception that training alone solves human vulnerability
>
> The reality is that even security experts make mistakes under the right conditions. No amount of technical security can fully protect against human error or manipulation.

> [!idea] Understanding Social Engineering
> Social engineering is psychological manipulation that exploits how humans naturally behave and make decisions. Rather than breaking technical security, it breaks human security.
>
> The core principle is exploiting trust. Humans are social creatures who:
> - Want to help others
> - Trust authority figures
> - Make quick decisions under pressure
> - Follow social norms
>
> A social engineering attack might unfold like this:
> 1. Attacker researches target on LinkedIn, learning their role and colleagues
> 2. Creates urgent scenario ("Your boss needs this file immediately")
> 3. Uses pressure ("The client is waiting, we'll lose the deal")
> 4. Exploits natural helping behavior ("I know this is irregular, but I really need your help")
>
> This works because it triggers natural human responses - we want to help, we respond to authority, and we make rushed decisions under pressure.
