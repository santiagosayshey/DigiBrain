idea - fuzzing
- find bugs in a program by feeding in random, innocuous inputs that dont allign with regular use
	- the idea is the explore the entire range of state space and find issues with programs that deal with complex file parsing or input data
- strategies
	- mutation based - take normal inputs and mutate ot
	- generation based  - generatge specific inputs based on application
	- measure code coverage to guide fuzzing towards new program states

example - fuzzing

```
cat /dev/random | head -c 512 >> rand.jpeg; open rand.jpeg
```

- explain this more
	- what does it do?
	- how might a program react to this?


idea - mutation based
- do things like flip bits, increment integers, etc
- suprisingly sucessful
- add example here
- simple to setup and run
- success depends mostly on the quality of the intial real inputs


idea - generation based fuzzing
