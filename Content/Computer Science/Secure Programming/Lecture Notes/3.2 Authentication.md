> Proof factors:
> - Something I know: e.g., password
> - Something I have: e.g., token, phone
> - Something I am: e.g., fingerprint, retina, typing pattern
> 
> These factors can be used individually or in combination to verify a user's identity.

> [!consider] Authentication Vulnerabilities
> Attackers can impersonate legitimate users by compromising authentication factors:
> 
> - **Stealing "something you know"**:
>   - Keyloggers capture passwords as they're typed
>   - Network sniffing intercepts transmitted credentials
> 
> - **Compromising "something you have"**:
>   - Intercepting or cloning physical tokens
>   - SIM swapping to gain control of a phone number
> 
> - **Replicating "something you are"**:
>   - Creating fake biometrics (e.g., 3D-printed fingerprints)
>   - Capturing and replaying biometric data
>   - Using lifelike masks (as seen in Mission Impossible films) to fool facial recognition systems
> 
> These methods highlight the importance of multi-factor authentication and secure transmission of authentication data.

> [!idea] Challenge-Response Authentication
> Addresses the question: "**How can I verify the identity of the recipient?**"
> 
> Process:
> 1. **Challenge**: Sender generates a nonce (random, one-time value)
> 2. **Send**: Transmit nonce to the supposed recipient
> 3. **Compute**: Recipient calculates hash(nonce + shared_secret)
> 4. **Respond**: Recipient sends the computed hash back to the sender
> 5. **Verify**: Sender independently calculates hash(nonce + shared_secret)
> 6. **Compare**: Sender checks if the received hash matches the calculated one
> 
> Key concepts:
> - **Shared secret**: Pre-established key known only to legitimate parties. **Possession of this secret proves the recipient's identity**.
> - **Nonce**: One-time random value ensuring freshness of each authentication attempt
> - **Hash function**: One-way transformation **protecting the shared secret**
> - **Replay attack**: An attack where valid data transmission is maliciously repeated or delayed. The nonce prevents this by ensuring each challenge is unique.
> 
> This method verifies the recipient's identity by demonstrating knowledge of the shared secret without transmitting it directly.

> [!example] Nonce Usage in Challenge-Response Authentication
> 
> **Scenario**: Alice wants to authenticate Bob before sending sensitive data.
> 
> **With Nonce:**
> 1. Alice sends: "Challenge: 7391" (random nonce)
> 2. Bob computes: hash("7391" + shared_secret)
> 3. Bob responds: "Hash: a72f..."
> 4. Alice verifies the hash
> 
> **Without Nonce:**
> 1. Alice sends: "Challenge: Authenticate"
> 2. Bob computes: hash("Authenticate" + shared_secret)
> 3. Bob responds: "Hash: 5e2d..."
> 4. Alice verifies the hash
> 
> **Replay Attack (without nonce):**
> 1. Eve intercepts Bob's response: "Hash: 5e2d..."
> 2. Later, Eve impersonates Bob:
>    - Alice: "Challenge: Authenticate"
>    - Eve responds: "Hash: 5e2d..." (replayed)
>    - Alice incorrectly authenticates Eve as Bob
> 
> The nonce ensures each challenge is unique, preventing replay attacks by making previous responses invalid for future authentication attempts.
