> [!motivation] The Need for Software Development Process
> - Software projects can be complex, involving many stakeholders and requirements
> - Without a structured approach, projects risk going over budget, past deadlines and not meeting user needs
> - A systematic process helps manage complexity, improve quality and meet objectives

> [!idea] Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) 
> SDLC provides a structured approach to software development, helping to manage complexity and risk. Key phases include:
> 
> | Phase | Description |
> |-------|-------------|
> | Planning | Define project scope, objectives, resources |  
> | Analysis | Gather and analyze requirements |
> | Design | Create system architecture and specifications |
> | Implementation | Code the software based on design |
> | Testing | Verify software meets requirements, fix defects |
> | Deployment | Release software to production environment |
> | Maintenance | Fix issues, make enhancements, provide support |

> [!example] Waterfall Model
> One of the oldest SDLC models, Waterfall follows a linear sequential flow:
> 
> 1. Requirements gathered upfront 
> 2. Each phase completes before next begins
> 3. Works well for projects with stable, clear requirements
> 4. Less flexible to changes later in the lifecycle

> [!idea] Iterative and Incremental Development
> Iterative and incremental models, like **Agile**, take an evolutionary approach:
> - Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration 
> - The system is developed and delivered in smaller increments
> - Each iteration includes some planning, analysis, design, implementation and testing
> - Allows for more flexibility and adaptability to change
> - Faster delivery of working software to users for feedback
