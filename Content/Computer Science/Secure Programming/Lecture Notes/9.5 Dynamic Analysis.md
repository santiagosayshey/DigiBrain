idea - investigation of the properties of a software system during execution
- vulnerabilities are verifiable and exploitable
- black box testing ( what does this mean? )

consider - finite state machines
- what are they and how do they relate to dynamic analysis
- bugs occur when there is a reachable state in the actual state machine that doesnt exist in the intended one
- vulnera

example - finite state machine for basic if program
- mermaid diagram
- use colors for intended states, different for unintended states, transition states, unreachable states
- say that vulnerabilities exist in the unreachable states
