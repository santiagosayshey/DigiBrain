> [!motivation] Why Fuzzing Matters
> - Traditional software testing often **misses edge cases** and vulnerabilities
> - Programs that parse files or process complex input data are particularly vulnerable
> - Any crash indicates a potential bug, though not all bugs are exploitable
> - Need for systematic approaches to find unintended program states

> [!example] Basic Fuzzing Implementation
> Fuzzing **finds program bugs by feeding unexpected data into programs**. 
> ```bash
> cat /dev/random | head -c 512 >> rand.jpeg; open rand.jpeg
> ```
> **How it works**:
> 1. Generates random data stream
> 2. Takes first 512 bytes
> 3. Appends to JPEG file
> 4. Attempts to open resulting file
> 
> **Better Approaches**:
> - Randomly corrupt real JPEG files
> - Reference JPEG spec for "JPEG-looking" data
> - Measure parser coverage during testing

> [!idea] Fuzzing Strategies
> 
> **Mutation-based Fuzzing - CHANGING Existing Inputs**:
> - Takes working input and randomly changes it
> - Example: Starting with a valid PDF that opens fine, then changing random bytes. Like taking a working PDF of a tax form and randomly changing numbers and text. The PDF reader might crash when trying to display corrupted data
> 
> **Generation-based Fuzzing - CREATING New Inputs**:
> - Creates brand new inputs following format rules
> - Example: Creating HTTP requests from scratch knowing HTTP rules. Like crafting web requests that are technically valid HTTP but unusual - sending header fields that are maximum allowed length or using rare but valid HTTP methods
> 
> **Coverage-guided Fuzzing - MAPPING Program States**:
> - Acts like a program cartographer - maps every possible execution path:
>   1. Runs program with an input
>   2. Records which code paths were taken
>   3. Modifies input to trigger different paths
>   4. Saves inputs that found new paths
>   5. Repeats, building a complete map of program behavior
> - Example: When fuzzing an image viewer:
>   - Normal PNG → uses basic decompression
>   - Large PNG → discovers high-memory decompression code
>   - Corrupt PNG → finds error handling code
>   - Progressive PNG → reveals different decoder
>   Then systematically tests each of these discovered code paths for vulnerabilities
> 
> **Common Tool Examples**:
> 
> | Strategy | Notable Tools |
> |----------|--------------|
> | Mutation | AFL, radamsa |
> | Generation | Peach, Syzkaller |
> | Coverage | AFL++, libFuzzer |
> 
> All strategies aim to crash programs and find bugs, but:
> - Mutation is simple but effective: "break what works"
> - Generation is thorough but complex: "create tricky inputs"
> - Coverage is smart but resource-heavy: "test what's untested"

> [!consider] Integration with Software Testing
> Fuzzing works alongside three key testing types:
> 
> **Unit Tests + Fuzzing**:
> - Unit tests verify known behaviors
> - Fuzzing finds unknown edge cases
> - Together provide comprehensive testing
> 
> **Regression Tests + Fuzzing**:
> - Regression tests prevent known bugs
> - Fuzzing finds new variations of old bugs
> - "If you don't run them, attackers will"
> 
> **Integration Tests + Fuzzing**:
> - Integration tests verify component interactions
> - Fuzzing finds unexpected component behaviors
> - Particularly important for security boundaries

> [!consider] Best Practices & Success Stories
> **Key Guidelines**:
> - Use memory-safe languages where possible (Go, Rust)
> - Document threat models early
> - Design APIs for safe usage by default
> - Treat all external input as potentially malicious
> 
> **Notable Successes**:
> - Charlie Miller's simple PDF fuzzer found 64 exploitable crashes
> - Syzkaller has found hundreds of kernel vulnerabilities
> - AFL has discovered bugs in virtually every major software project
