> [!motivation] How is memory exploitation possible?
> Memory exploitation is possible due to two main reasons:
> - **Languages not designed for security**: Many older languages, like C and C++, were created with a focus on performance rather than security. They lack built-in memory safety features, leaving the responsibility of proper memory management to the programmer.
> - **Programmer skill issues**: Writing secure code requires a deep understanding of potential vulnerabilities. Inexperienced or careless programmers may inadvertently introduce memory-related bugs, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by attackers.

> [!consider] How can we ensure memory safety?
> There are several approaches to enhance memory safety:
> 1. **Use memory-safe languages**:
>    - Languages like Python, Go, and Rust have built-in mechanisms to check bounds and prevent undefined memory access.
>    - Historically, memory-safe languages were avoided due to performance concerns, but modern languages like Rust offer performance comparable to C.
>    - Legacy code and compatibility issues are the main reasons for the slow adoption of memory-safe languages.
> 2. **Write memory-safe code**:
>    - Programmers should include explicit checks in their code to handle potential memory-related issues.
>    - Using safe libraries (e.g., `fgets` instead of `gets`) can help mitigate risks.
>    - Validating and sanitizing user input is crucial to prevent exploitation.
> 3. **Utilize tools to analyze and patch insecure code**:
>    - Runtime checks can automatically detect and crash the program if an invalid memory access occurs.
>    - Monitoring runtime behavior can help identify unexpected or malicious actions.
>    - Running code in isolated environments, such as virtual machines, can contain potential damage.
>    - Bug-finding tools, such as fuzz testing and Valgrind, can help identify memory leaks and vulnerabilities.
>    - Code review, probing for known flaws, and penetration testing can further strengthen code security.
>    - Keeping libraries and dependencies up to date is essential to address known vulnerabilities.
