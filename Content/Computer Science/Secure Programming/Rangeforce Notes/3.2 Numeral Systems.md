- base indicates the number of unique digits
	- decimal is base 10, meaning it has 10 unique digits
	- binary is base 2, 1 and 0
- Questions to add - why is this important? why do computers work best in binary? Why do humans count in base? because we have 10 fingers?

# Binary
- bits are single digits represented in binary
- Bytes are 8 bits
- Nibbles are 4 bits long and represent a single hex value
- Two nibbles are contained in a byte, and therefore single bytes can be represented as two hex values
- A single byte is the most atomic addressable unit of memory. This means that when you work with data, the least amount of data you *must* change at once, is 1 bytes
