> [!idea] Race Condition
> A race condition occurs when the **behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events, especially in multi-threaded or concurrent environments.**
> - Can lead to data corruption, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities
> - Often difficult to reproduce and debug
> 
> Mitigation:
> - Use synchronization primitives (e.g., mutexes, semaphores)
> - Implement proper locking mechanisms
> - Design thread-safe data structures and algorithms
> - Use atomic operations where appropriate
> - Employ static analysis tools to detect potential race conditions

> [!example] Race Condition Example
> Vulnerable code (Python):
> ```python
> balance = 100  # Shared resource
> 
> def withdraw(amount):
>     global balance
>     if balance >= amount:
>         # Simulating processing time
>         time.sleep(0.1)
>         balance -= amount
>         return True
>     return False
> 
> # Thread 1
> if withdraw(90):
>     print("Withdrawal 1 successful")
> 
> # Thread 2 (runs concurrently)
> if withdraw(90):
>     print("Withdrawal 2 successful")
> ```
> This code can lead to both withdrawals succeeding even though there's insufficient balance.
> 
> Secure version:
> ```python
> import threading
> 
> balance = 100
> lock = threading.Lock()
> 
> def withdraw(amount):
>     global balance
>     with lock:
>         if balance >= amount:
>             time.sleep(0.1)
>             balance -= amount
>             return True
>     return False
> ```
> The secure version uses a lock to ensure atomic access to the shared resource.
