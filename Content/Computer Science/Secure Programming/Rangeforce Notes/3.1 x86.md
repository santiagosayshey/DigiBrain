> [!motivation] Processor Architecture
> Computer systems require a central processing unit (CPU) to execute instructions and perform calculations. Different processor architectures define how these CPUs are designed and function, impacting performance, power consumption, and compatibility across various devices and software.

> [!idea] x86 Architecture
> x86 is a family of backward-compatible instruction set architectures (ISAs) based on the Intel 8086 CPU.
> - **CISC-based**: Complex Instruction Set Computing
> - **Key features**:
>   - Variable instruction length
>   - Large number of addressing modes
>   - Hardware-managed instruction pipeline
> - **Variants**: x86-32 (32-bit) and x86-64 (64-bit)
> 
> | Feature | x86-32 | x86-64 |
> |---------|--------|--------|
> | Max memory | 4 GB | 16 EB |
> | Register width | 32-bit | 64-bit |
> | Introduced | 1985 | 2003 |

> [!consider] Other Processor Architectures
> Several other processor architectures exist, each with unique characteristics:
> - **ARM**: Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture
>   - Low power consumption
>   - Common in mobile devices and embedded systems
> - **RISC-V**: Open-source RISC architecture
>   - Customizable and royalty-free
>   - Growing adoption in various domains
> - **POWER**: IBM's RISC architecture
>   - Used in servers and high-performance computing

> [!example] Processor Architecture Comparison
> Consider a task of adding two numbers:
> 
> **x86 (CISC)**:
> ```x86asm
> ADD EAX, EBX  ; Add contents of EBX to EAX
> ```
> 
> **ARM (RISC)**:
> ```arm
> ADD R0, R1, R2  ; Add R1 and R2, store in R0
> ```
> 
> The x86 instruction combines loading and addition, while ARM separates these operations, illustrating the difference between CISC and RISC approaches.
