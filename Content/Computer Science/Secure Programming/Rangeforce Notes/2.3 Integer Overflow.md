
> [!idea] Integer Overflow
> Integer overflow occurs when an **arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value outside the range that can be represented** with a given number of bits.
> - Can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities
> - Often occurs in loops or when performing calculations with user input
> 
> Mitigation:
> - Use appropriate data types (e.g., unsigned for non-negative values)
> - Implement range checking before arithmetic operations
> - Consider using language-specific overflow detection features
> - Use safe integer libraries that provide overflow-safe operations

> [!example] Integer Overflow Example
> Vulnerable code:
> ```c
> unsigned int sum = 0;
> for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
>     sum += i * 1000000;  // May overflow
> }
> printf("Sum: %u\n", sum);
> ```
> This code can overflow `sum`, resulting in an incorrect result.
> 
> Secure version:
> ```c
> #include <stdint.h>
> #include <inttypes.h>
> 
> uint64_t sum = 0;
> for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
>     if (sum > UINT64_MAX - (uint64_t)i * 1000000) {
>         printf("Overflow detected\n");
>         break;
>     }
>     sum += (uint64_t)i * 1000000;
> }
> printf("Sum: %" PRIu64 "\n", sum);
> ```
> The secure version uses a larger integer type and checks for potential overflow before each addition.
