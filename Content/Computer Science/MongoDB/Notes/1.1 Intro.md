> [!idea] MongoDB Overview
> - MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented model.
> - It **stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON)**.
> - MongoDB provides high scalability, performance, and flexibility for handling unstructured data.

> [!example] Example MongoDB Document
> Consider a blog application where each blog post is stored as a document in MongoDB:
> 
> ```json
> {
>   "_id": ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
>   "title": "Introduction to MongoDB",
>   "author": "John Doe",
>   "content": "MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database...",
>   "tags": ["mongodb", "nosql", "databases"],
>   "comments": [
>     {
>       "user": "Jane Smith",
>       "text": "Great article!"
>     },
>     {
>       "user": "Mike Johnson",
>       "text": "Thanks for the introduction!"
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```

> This example demonstrates how MongoDB allows for nested structures and arrays within a single document, providing flexibility in data modeling.

> [!idea] Key Features of MongoDB
> - **Flexible Schema**: MongoDB allows for dynamic and evolving schemas, making it easier to adapt to changing application requirements.
> - **Indexing**: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes, for optimizing query performance.
> - **Replication**: MongoDB provides built-in replication for high availability and fault tolerance through replica sets.
> - **Sharding**: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, allowing for the distribution of data across multiple machines.

> [!example] Querying Data in MongoDB
> To query data in MongoDB, you can use the `find()` method. For example, to find all blog posts with the tag "mongodb":
> 
> ```javascript
> db.posts.find({ tags: "mongodb" })
> ```
> 
> You can also use various query operators for more advanced filtering:
> 
> ```javascript
> // Find posts where the author is "John Doe" and the title contains "MongoDB"
> db.posts.find({ 
>   author: "John Doe",
>   title: { $regex: /MongoDB/ }
> })
> ```

> [!consider] MongoDB Use Cases
> - **Content Management Systems**: MongoDB's flexible schema is well-suited for storing and managing structured and unstructured content.
> - **Real-time Analytics**: MongoDB's ability to handle high write loads and provide fast read performance makes it suitable for real-time analytics applications.
> - **Internet of Things (IoT)**: MongoDB's scalability and ability to handle semi-structured data make it a good fit for storing and processing IoT data.
> - **Caching**: MongoDB can be used as a caching layer to store frequently accessed data and improve application performance.
