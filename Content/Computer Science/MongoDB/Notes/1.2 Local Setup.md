> [!idea] Installing MongoDB Locally
> - MongoDB can be installed locally using official installation packages or package managers.
> - Package managers simplify the installation process and manage dependencies automatically.
> 
> **macOS (using Homebrew):**
> 1. Open a terminal.
> 2. Install Homebrew if you haven't already:
>    ```bash
>    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
>    ```
> 3. Install MongoDB:
>    ```bash
>    brew tap mongodb/brew
>    brew install mongodb-community
>    ```
> 
> **Ubuntu (using apt):**
> 1. Open a terminal.
> 2. Update the package list:
>    ```bash
>    sudo apt update
>    ```
> 3. Install MongoDB:
>    ```bash
>    sudo apt install mongodb
>    ```
> 
> **Windows (using Chocolatey):**
> 1. Open an administrative command prompt.
> 2. Install Chocolatey if you haven't already:
>    ```bash
>    @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
>    ```
> 3. Install MongoDB:
>    ```bash
>    choco install mongodb
>    ```
> 
> **Manual Installation:**
> If you prefer manual installation or your operating system is not listed above, you can follow these steps:
> 1. Visit the official MongoDB download page: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
> 2. Choose your operating system and download the appropriate package.
> 3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
> 4. Once installed, MongoDB will be available on your local machine.

> [!example] Starting MongoDB Server
> To start the MongoDB server locally, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> mongod
> ```
> 
> This will start the MongoDB server and it will listen for incoming connections on the default port `27017`.

> [!idea] Connecting to MongoDB
> - To interact with MongoDB, you need to connect to the server using the MongoDB Shell or a MongoDB driver for your programming language.
> - To connect using the MongoDB Shell, open another terminal or command prompt and run:
> 
> ```bash
> mongo
> ```
> 
> This will connect to the MongoDB server running on `localhost` and port `27017`.

> [!example] Creating a Database and Collection
> Once connected to the MongoDB Shell, you can create a new database and collection using the following commands:
> 
> ```javascript
> use myDatabase
> db.createCollection("users")
> ```
> 
> This creates a new database named `myDatabase` and a collection named `users` within that database.

> [!consider] GUI Tools for MongoDB
> - While the MongoDB Shell is powerful, you may find it more convenient to use a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for managing MongoDB.
> - Some popular GUI tools for MongoDB include:
>   - MongoDB Compass: The official GUI from MongoDB.
>   - Robo 3T: A popular cross-platform MongoDB GUI.
>   - Studio 3T: Another widely used MongoDB GUI with advanced features.
> - These tools provide a visual interface for managing databases, collections, and documents, making it easier to work with MongoDB.
