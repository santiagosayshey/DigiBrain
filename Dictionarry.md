Hello, I'd like to share the passion project I've been working on for the past 2 years of my life. I often see that many posts here on linkedin are often self congratulatory and indulge in celebrating each other's careers, goals and achievements. This is a good thing, this platform is meant to be a place in which we can show ourselves off and convince our future employers - hire me! 

I feel like its the expected culture at this point:

```
im <emotional adjective> to share that i'm <verb>ing as a <superfluous title> at <prestigious company>.

here's what i learned
- something about teamwork
- something about overcoming challenges
- something about the importance of learning
```

There's nothing wrong this these posts, but they fail to capture our full experiences. They fail to show that real achievement and growth is hard, doesn't usually happen, and requires more than just hard work. In this post, I want to share my genuine experience in working on something, that meant something. Not so that I can wallow in my misery, or get engagement by being different, but so that I can help encourage people to keep doing what they're doing, and not feel intimated or scared or less than, for not following the status quo. 

I worked on Dictionarry and Profilarr for 2 years. I used every bit of knowledge I've learned so far in my 3 years of computer science. I built a website. Then i built a better website. Then I built a full stack development platform with git integration, authentication and a custom compiler. 

At no point, did I *ever* feel like I knew what i was doing. I constantly felt like an imposter
