Hello, I'd like to share the passion project I've been working on for the past 2 years of my life. I often see that many posts here on linkedin are often self congratulatory and indulge in celebrating each other's careers, goals and achievements. This is a good thing, this platform is meant to be a place in which we can show ourselves off and convince our future employers - hire me! 

I feel like its the expected culture at this point:
