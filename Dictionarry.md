Hello, I'd like to share the passion project I've been working on for the past 2 years of my life. I often see that many posts here on linkedin are often self congratulatory and indulge in celebrating each other's careers, goals and achievements. This is a good thing, this platform is meant to be a place in which we can show ourselves off and convince our future employers - hire me! 

I feel like its the expected culture at this point:

```
im <emotional adjective> to share that i'm <verb>ing as a <superfluous title> at <prestigious company>.

here's what i learned
- something about teamwork
- something about overcoming challenges
- something about the importance of learning
```

There's nothing wrong this these posts, but they fail to capture our full experiences. They fail to show that real achievement and growth is hard, doesn't usually happen, and requires more than just hard work. In this post, I want to share my genuine experience in working on something that actually meant something to me. Not so that I can wallow in my misery, or get engagement by being different, but so that I can help encourage people to keep doing what they're doing, and not feel intimated or scared or less than, for not following the status quo. 

I worked on Dictionarry and Profilarr for 2 years. I used every bit of knowledge I've learned so far in my 3 years of computer science. I built a website. Then i built a better website. Then I built a full stack development platform with git integration, authentication and a custom compiler!

At no point, did I *ever* feel like I knew what i was doing. I constantly felt like an impostor; that what i was building was impossible, nobody would appreciate and would ultimately be forgotten. People would see through my unoptimized, non factory pattern singleton functional code and not recognize me as a developer, but as a fraud. Somebody who is somehow deceiving us for monetary gain and clout. 

My brain still convinces me that these are facts sometimes. Even after I look at the 3000+ commits on GitHub, the community I've built on Discord and even the optional donations I've received. I still see the few harsh comments from the occasional entitled user and/or competitors and convince myself that it's on me to change their mind. It's on me to write better code. It's on me to *do better*. 

But what I'm starting to understand is, that it's not on me. It's not on me, because I'm already doing the best I can. That's what I want people to take away from this post - that nothing really matters if you're already doing the best you can. These posts often portray a sense of ... I'm better than you and here's why.
