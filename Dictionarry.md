Hello, I'd like to share the passion project I've been working on for the past 2 years of my life. I often see that many posts here on linkedin are often self congratulatory and indulge in celebrating each other's careers, goals and achievements. This is a good thing, this platform is meant to be a place in which we can show ourselves off and convince our future employers - hire me! 

I feel like its the expected culture at this point:

```
im <emotional adjective> to share that i'm <verb>ing as a <superfluous title> at <prestigious company>.

here's what i learned
- something about teamwork
- something about overcoming challenges
- something about the importance of learning
```

There's nothing wrong this these posts, but they fail to capture our full experiences. They fail to show that real achievement and growth is hard, doesn't usually happen, and requires more than just hard work. In this post, I want to share my genuine experience in working on something that actually meant something to me. Not so that I can wallow in my misery, or get engagement by being different, but so that I can help encourage people to keep doing what they're doing, and not feel intimidated or scared or less than, for not following the status quo. 

I worked on Dictionarry and Profilarr for 2 years. I used every bit of knowledge I've learned so far in my 3 years of computer science. I built a website. Then i built a better website. Then I built a full stack development platform with git integration, authentication and a custom compiler!

At no point, did I *ever* feel like I knew what i was doing. I constantly felt like an impostor; that what i was building was impossible, nobody would appreciate and would ultimately be forgotten. People would see through my unoptimized, non factory pattern singleton functional code and not recognize me as a developer, but as a fraud. Somebody who is somehow deceiving us for monetary gain and clout. I remember going to bed one night so anxious about the merge conflict module that I actually dreamed about someone coming to my house and grafitting my walls because it had sucked s

My brain still convinces me that these are facts sometimes. Even after I look at the 3000+ commits on GitHub, the community I've built on Discord and even the optional donations I've received. I still see the few harsh comments from entitled users / disgruntled competitors and convince myself that it's on me to change their mind. It's on me to write better code. It's on me to *do better*. 

I'll see a LinkedIn / Facebook / Instagram post and think to myself - "Wow! This person really has their stuff together, I need to be more like them." That this person has ended up in this terrific new situation of growth and money and all these great things we want, simply because they are a better person than I am. 

But what I'm starting to understand, is that none of those things really matter. It's not actually on me to convince every single person on the planet that my project is good. What somebody else is doing with their life shouldn't influence how I go about living mine. None of those things matter, because I'm already doing the best I can, and that is enough. That's what I want people to take away from this post - if you're doing the best you can, then nothing else matters. Pat yourself on the back. Pat other people on the back. 

With that being said, go give my development logs a read sometime
