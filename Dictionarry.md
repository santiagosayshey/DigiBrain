Hello, I'd like to share the passion project I've been working on for the past 2 years of my life. I often see that many posts here on linkedin are often self congratulatory and indulge in celebrating each other's careers, goals and achievements. This is a good thing, this platform is meant to be a place in which we can show ourselves off and convince our future employers - hire me! 

I feel like its the expected culture at this point:

```
im <emotional adjective> to share that i'm <verb>ing as a <superfluous title> at <prestigious company>.

here's what i learned
- something about teamwork
- something about overcoming challenges
- something about the importance of learning
```

There's nothing wrong this these posts, but they fail to capture our full experiences. They fail to show that real achievement and growth is hard, doesn't usually happen 

continuing way more, but goes into all the bad things that happened during development. why its important that im sharing these things - so that others can see that its normal, so they dont feel inferrior, and so that we stop propagating toxing work cultures, expectations and be kinder to each other.
