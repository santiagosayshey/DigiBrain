Hello, I'd like to share Dictionarry, a passion project I've been working on for the past 2 years. It's a self-hosting companion ecosystem that aims to abstract complex audio/video concepts into quantifiable needs through objective, data-driven configurations. It consists of three core components:

- A Git-based Configuration Store
    - Leverages version-controlled YAML files instead of traditional databases
    - Enables direct user modifications and configuration persistence
    - https://github.com/Dictionarry-Hub/database

- An Interactive Documentation Platform
    - Built with Next.js as a static site with incremental regeneration
    - Features a Profile Builder for configuration discovery
    - https://dictionarry.dev/

- Profilarr: Integration & Management Tool
	- Full-featured platform for database integration and contribution
    - Supports custom database implementations and community extensions
    - Built with React and Flask for robust frontend and backend operations
    - Open development model enabling direct community contributions
    - https://github.com/Dictionarry-Hub/profilarr

I'm proud of what I've built here, but it isn't the full story. I often see many self congratulatory, indulgent posts here on LinkedIn that on the surface, celebrate our careers, goals and achievements. After all, LinkedIn is meant to be a platform for which we show ourselves off and convince our employers to hire us. 

I feel like its the expected culture at this point:

```
im <emotional adjective> to share that i'm <verb>ing as a <superfluous title> at <prestigious company>.

here's what i learned
- something about teamwork
- something about overcoming challenges
- something about the importance of learning
```

There's nothing wrong with this these posts, but they fail to capture our full experiences. I want to share my full experience with you all - not for engagement, but to encourage others who might feel intimidated by the endless stream of polished success stories.

I've worked on Dictionarry for 2 years. I've used every bit of knowledge I've learned so far in my 3 years of computer science. I built a website. Then I built a better website. Then I built a full stack development platform with git integration, authentication and a custom compiler.

At no point, did I *ever* feel like I knew what i was doing. I constantly felt like an impostor; that what i was building was impossible, nobody would appreciate and would ultimately be forgotten. People would see through my unoptimized, non factory pattern singleton functional code and not recognize me as a developer, but as a fraud. Somebody who is somehow deceiving us for monetary gain and clout. One night, I was so stressed about the merge conflict module that I literally dreamed about getting into a fight with someone who was furious about how badly it worked.

My brain still convinces me that these are facts sometimes. Even after all the positive feedback and community support, I still fixate on the few harsh comments and convince myself that it's on me to change their mind. It's on me to write better code. It's on me to _do better_. I'll see posts on social media and think to myself - 'Wow! This person really has their life figured out.' As if their success and growth came naturally to them, while I'm still here struggling with the basics.

But what I'm starting to understand is that none of that really matters. It's not about convincing everyone that what I'm doing is worthwhile. Someone else's path doesn't need to define our own. I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough. That's what I hope people take away from this - your best is enough.

I'm not building a startup worth a billion dollars - I'm haphazardly building a very niche solution to a very niche problem that matters to me. And I think that's worth celebrating just as much as any polished LinkedIn success story.
