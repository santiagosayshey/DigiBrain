# Homicide Recidivism: First-Time vs. Repeat Offenders

**Recidivism in Murder Cases:** Data from the U.S. Department of Justice indicate that the vast **majority of homicides are committed by people with no prior homicide convictions**, while repeat killers are exceedingly rare. A Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) study of prisoners released after serving time for murder found **only about 1% were arrested for another homicide**​[sentencingproject.org](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/a-new-lease-on-life/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20a%202002%20Bureau%20of,35%20Persons%20released%20after%20a). This aligns with other analyses showing **“murders have the lowest recidivism rates for any crime”** – fewer than 2% of murderers ever kill again​[quora.com](https://www.quora.com/Years-ago-I-either-read-that-half-of-all-murders-are-committed-by-people-who-have-already-been-convicted-of-a-murder-or-that-half-of-all-people-convicted-of-murder-commit-another-one-Is-either-one-true#:~:text=,kill%20a%20second%20time). In other words, **roughly 98–99% of homicide offenders do not commit another murder** after their first offense. Correspondingly, government data on death row inmates show that **about 1 in 12 (≈8%) had a prior homicide conviction**, meaning **over 90% were first-time homicide offenders**​[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/documents/case-against-death-penalty#:~:text=murders%20again,convicted%20murderer%20%E2%80%93%20a%20policy).

> _Insight:_ Many perpetrators of murder _do_ have criminal histories – for example, **58% of convicted murderers had at least one prior felony arrest** (often for crimes like assault, robbery, etc.)​[city-journal.org](https://www.city-journal.org/article/second-third-and-fourth-chances-at-what-price#:~:text=church%20shooting%20does%20have%20an,deincarceration%20advocates%20have%20their%20way). However, **having a prior murder on one’s record is exceptionally uncommon**. The **“repeat murderer” contributes to well under 1% of U.S. homicides**, as most killers never murder again once caught or incarcerated. This data is often cited in arguments against the death penalty to argue that executing offenders is unnecessary for preventing repeat offenses; life imprisonment typically incapacitates the offender, and true recidivist killers are very rare​[sentencingproject.org](https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/a-new-lease-on-life/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20a%202002%20Bureau%20of,35%20Persons%20released%20after%20a)​[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/documents/case-against-death-penalty#:~:text=murders%20again,convicted%20murderer%20%E2%80%93%20a%20policy).

# Capital Punishment and Deterrence of Homicide

## Murder Rates in Death Penalty vs. Non-Death Penalty States

**Comparative Crime Statistics:** Empirical evidence has **not shown lower murder rates in jurisdictions with the death penalty**. In fact, the opposite pattern is often observed. According to FBI Uniform Crime Report data compiled over several decades, **states without capital punishment consistently have lower homicide rates than states that retain the death penalty**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states#:~:text=The%20mur%C2%ADder%20rate%20in%20non,gap%20has%20grown%20since%201990). This gap has been evident since at least the 1990s and has **grown over time**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states#:~:text=The%20mur%C2%ADder%20rate%20in%20non,gap%20has%20grown%20since%201990). For example, in 1999 the average murder rate in death-penalty states was **5.5 per 100,000 people**, compared to **3.6 per 100,000** in non-death-penalty states – a significantly **higher rate in the capital-punishment states**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states#:~:text=When%20com%C2%ADpar%C2%ADisons%20are%20made%20between,6).

This trend persists in recent years. During the 2020 pandemic year (when homicides spiked nationally), an analysis found **murder rates were highest in states that use the death penalty and lowest in long-time abolitionist states**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/dpic-analysis-pandemic-murder-rates-highest-in-death-penalty-states#:~:text=The%20data%20show%20that%20nine,5). Nine of the ten states with the highest 2020 murder rates were death-penalty states, whereas eight of the eleven states with the lowest murder rates had abolished the death penalty​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/dpic-analysis-pandemic-murder-rates-highest-in-death-penalty-states#:~:text=The%20data%20show%20that%20nine,5). **Regionally, the U.S. South – which accounts for over 80% of all executions since 1976 – has long recorded the highest murder rates in the country**, year after year​[files.deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/pdf/FactSheet.pdf?dm=1744228218#:~:text=flawed%E2%80%9D%20and%20should%20not%20be,had%20the%20lowest%20murder%20rate). By contrast, the Northeast – with less than 0.5% of all executions – consistently has the **lowest homicide rates** among U.S. regions​[files.deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/pdf/FactSheet.pdf?dm=1744228218#:~:text=flawed%E2%80%9D%20and%20should%20not%20be,had%20the%20lowest%20murder%20rate). For instance, in 2020 the South’s murder rate was about 8.0 per 100,000 people, whereas the Northeast’s was around 4.5 per 100,000​[files.deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/pdf/FactSheet.pdf?dm=1744228218#:~:text=flawed%E2%80%9D%20and%20should%20not%20be,had%20the%20lowest%20murder%20rate). This inverse relationship (more executions but higher murders, and vice versa) suggests **no observable deterrent effect** at the macro level.

## Research on the Death Penalty’s Deterrent Effect

**Longitudinal Studies and Expert Consensus:** Criminological research over decades has _not_ found credible evidence that capital punishment deters homicide more effectively than alternative punishments. Studies on the topic have produced **widely conflicting results** – some early econometric studies claimed each execution saves a number of lives, while others found no effect or even a _“brutalization effect”_ (i.e. executions _increasing_ violence)​[nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13363/chapter/2#:~:text=the%20United%20States%20to%20examine,convened%20against%20this%20backdrop%20of). Because of these contradictions, the **National Research Council (National Academy of Sciences)** assembled a panel to review all available studies (post-Gregg v. Georgia). In its 2012 report _Deterrence and the Death Penalty_, the NRC concluded that **existing research is **not informative** as to whether the death penalty decreases, increases, or has any effect on homicide rates**​[nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13363/chapter/2#:~:text=CONCLUSION%20AND%20RECOMMENDATION%3A%20The%20committee,policy%20judgments%20about%20capital%20punishment). The committee found fundamental flaws in the methodologies of past studies and recommended that such analyses _“not be used to inform deliberations”_ on capital punishment’s efficacy​[nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13363/chapter/2#:~:text=CONCLUSION%20AND%20RECOMMENDATION%3A%20The%20committee,policy%20judgments%20about%20capital%20punishment). In short, there is **no reliable scientific evidence** that executions influence murder rates.

**Surveys of experts reinforce this conclusion.** In a 2009 study published in the _Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology_, 88% of the nation’s leading criminologists agreed that **the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to homicide**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-majority-of-leading-criminologists-find-death-penalty-does-not-deter-murder#:~:text=Eighty,sev%C2%ADen). 87% of these experts also stated that abolishing the death penalty would not have any significant effect on murder rates​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-majority-of-leading-criminologists-find-death-penalty-does-not-deter-murder#:~:text=only%20their%20views%20of%20deter%C2%ADrence,the%20study%20here%20and%20the). This overwhelming consensus among criminologists is that **capital punishment provides no added deterrent benefit beyond long-term imprisonment**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/studies-majority-of-leading-criminologists-find-death-penalty-does-not-deter-murder#:~:text=penal%C2%ADty%20would%20not%20have%20any,the%20study%20here%20and%20the). Police leaders express similar views: in a national poll of police chiefs, the death penalty was ranked _the least effective_ tool for reducing violent crime, below measures like increased policing or drug control​[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/documents/case-against-death-penalty#:~:text=The%20death%20penalty%20is%20not,the%20true%20causes%20of%20crime)​[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/documents/case-against-death-penalty#:~:text=asked%20to%20rank%20the%20factors,public%20and%20mask%20their%20own).

**Overall Deterrence Assessment:** When comparing states directly or examining trends over time, **no clear deterrent effect from the death penalty has been observed**. States without the death penalty often have **lower or declining murder rates relative to those with it**​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states#:~:text=The%20mur%C2%ADder%20rate%20in%20non,gap%20has%20grown%20since%201990)​[deathpenaltyinfo.org](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states#:~:text=When%20com%C2%ADpar%C2%ADisons%20are%20made%20between,6), undermining the notion that the threat of execution is needed to prevent killings. The **lack of difference (or worse outcomes) in death-penalty jurisdictions** and the consensus of scientific reviews **indicate that capital punishment has not demonstrably deterred homicide**. As the National Research Council summed up, _“claims that research demonstrates any deterrent effect of capital punishment are not supported by the evidence”_​[nap.nationalacademies.org](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13363/chapter/2#:~:text=CONCLUSION%20AND%20RECOMMENDATION%3A%20The%20committee,policy%20judgments%20about%20capital%20punishment). Instead, murder rates appear driven by factors independent of a state’s use of the death penalty, and long-term imprisonment (such as life without parole) achieves incapacitation of dangerous offenders without the uncertainties of a supposed deterrent effect.
