# hey!

Welcome to my Digital Brain. This repository is mostly a collection of my Computer Science notes at my time at the University of Adelaide, but also includes some journaling stuff as well as some of my side projects.

My approach to note-taking prioritises creating "beautiful" notes, as opposed to focusing solely on the content itself. I believe that this strategy enhances visual-based learning and makes the process more engaging, rather than relying on rote memorisation. 

**Disclaimer:** As someone who believes in FOSS, I have created this repository to serve as a learning resource. It contains solutions to assignments, tutorials, problem sets, etc. However, it is crucial to emphasise that under no circumstances should you copy these solutions verbatim for your own assignments. **Don't be an idiot.**

## Instructions

### 1. Download
To access the contents of this digital brain, begin by downloading the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the "Download" button on the repository page.

### 2. Open as Vault
Once the repository is downloaded, open Obsidian on your device. Then, navigate to "File" > "Open folder as vault" and select the downloaded repository folder.

### 3. Set Theme to "Things"
To maintain the aesthetic integrity of the notes and optimize the visual experience, set the Obsidian theme to "Things." This theme has been specifically chosen to complement the content and enhance readability.

### 4. Enable CSS Snippets
For further customization and enhancement of the visual presentation, enable CSS snippets within Obsidian. These snippets are designed to improve the overall appearance of the notes and provide a more immersive reading experience.

## Additional Notes
Feel free to explore the contents of this digital brain at your own pace. Whether you're delving into Computer Science concepts, perusing journal entries, or examining side projects, I hope you find both inspiration and knowledge within these digital pages.
