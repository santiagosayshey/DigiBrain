# Hey!

Welcome to my Digital Brain. This repository is mostly a collection of my Computer Science notes at my time at the University of Adelaide, but also includes some journaling stuff as well as some of my side projects.

My approach to note-taking prioritises creating "beautiful" notes, as opposed to focusing solely on the content itself. I believe that this strategy enhances visual-based learning and makes the process more engaging, rather than relying on rote memorisation.


 As someone who believes in FOSS, I have created this repository to serve as a learning resource. It contains solutions to assignments, tutorials, problem sets, etc. However, it is crucial to emphasise that under no circumstances should you copy these solutions verbatim for your own assignments. **Don't be an idiot.**


# How do I view these notes?

1. **Download the vault:**
   - **Download as ZIP:**
      - Go to the repository page, click the green "Code" button, and select "Download ZIP".
      - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location.
   - **Clone using Git:**
      - Open a terminal, navigate to the desired directory, and run: 
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/santiagosayshey/DigiBrain
        ```

2. **Open as Vault**
   - Once the repository is downloaded, open Obsidian on your device. Then, navigate to "File" > "Open folder as vault" and select the downloaded repository folder.

3. **Set Theme to "Things"**
   - Alternatively, you can choose not to set the theme. "Things" is my preferred theme for its aesthetics.

4. **Enable CSS Snippets**
   - Go to the appearance section in Obsidian settings and enable all the CSS snippets. This will modify the appearance of callouts and adjust their margins/padding.
