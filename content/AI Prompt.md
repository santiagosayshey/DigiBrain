Hello Claude,

I would like your assistance in writing concise, modular notes on the topic of Kruskal's Algorithm. The goal is to create notes that are easy to understand and focused on key ideas rather than verbatim copying from textbooks. 

Please use the following note-taking format:

> [!motivation|orange] Motivation
>
> Content explaining the motivation or real-world applications for the concept.

> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept
>
> Explanation of the main idea or concept in a concise manner.

> [!example] Example or Illustration
>
> Provide a concrete example or illustration to help clarify the main idea or concept. This could be a code snippet, diagram, or real-world scenario.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas
>
> Discuss any additional points to consider, analogies, related ideas, or implications of the main concept. This helps to provide context and connect ideas.

The different callouts serve specific purposes:

- [!motivation]: Introduces the motivation for the main idea of the note
- [!idea]: Introduces a main idea or concept.
- [!example]: Provides a concrete example or illustration.
- [!consider]: Discusses additional considerations, related ideas, or implications.

You may also include the following elements in the callouts:

- Tables: Please ensure that tables follow markdown formatting rules.
- Images: Indicate where the image should be placed and provide a description so that I can find or create a suitable image (e.g., drawing a graph to illustrate Dijkstra's algorithm in Figma).
- Math: When including mathematical equations, please use Obsidian's formatting rules - `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for equation blocks.

I have provided additional context on the desired notes below. Please use this information as a guide for what you should write:
