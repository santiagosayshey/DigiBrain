Feeling pretty anxious about getting incorrectly 'banned' from a couple of websites I'm on. Writing this all down to remember what to say in my therapy session on Friday
- Feeling pretty insecure about talking about this with anyone, despite how I'm feeling. I guess I'm scared about how people would react when they hear how upset someone is about some websites. Going through scenarios in my head where I feel like I have to explain why I feel so awful, even though I know I'm allowed to feel any way that I want. 
- Even though I know they would be supportive and understanding, for some reason I have this picture in my head that I'll be laughed at for being so upset about such a silly thing. But in my head, its not really a silly thing. Being banned from these websites, means being banned from other websites. These websites are the backbone for Dictionarry, which has been a great project for me to work on. 
- Now I'm even trying to justify to myself that I'm allowed to feel this way.
