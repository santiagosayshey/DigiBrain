## Language Specification
- Jack is a high level object based programming language similar to C++ / Java
### Syntactic Elements
- Jack programs are a sequence of tokens separated by whitespace
- Tokens can be symbols, reserved words, constants and identifiers

![](docs/Images/figure_9.6.png)

### Program Structure
- Programs are a collection of classes stored in the same folder
- One class must be `Main` and this class must have a function `main`
- Execution starts with the `Main.main` function
- Basic programming unit is a `class`
	- Each class exists in a separate class file `Class.jack`
	- Classes start with an uppercase letter

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.1.png)

- A class declaration specifies a name which methods can be accessed `class.subroutine`
- Contains `field` declarations for object properties and `static` declarations
- Then contains `subroutines`
	- `methods` operate on the current object
	- `functions` operate on the class abstraction itself, not relying on a unique object
	- `constructors` create and return new objects of the class type

```
class SomeClass {

    field int someField;

    function void someFunction(int arg) {
        // This is a function.
        // It does NOT have access to someField.
        do something();
    }

    method void someMethod(int arg) {
        // This is a method.
        // It has access to someField via the this pointer.
        let someField = arg;  // modifies the object's field
    }
}
```

- Includes a `name` to be accessed by its class `class.name`
- Includes a type to indicate what is returned by the routine (`void` if no return)
	- Can be any primitive, abstract or standard class data type
	- Constructor's return type must be of the class it belongs to
- Includes a parameter list of typed variables to be used as arguments 
	- `int x, boolean sign, Fraction g`
- Constructors can be arbitrarily named, and there may exist multiple of them
	- Usually called `new`
- Contains a sequence of local variable declarations `var` statements and then statements to manipulate that data
- Each subroutine ends with a `return` expression
	- Must return variable of type defined in subroutine declaration
	- `void` returns nothing `return;`
	- Constructors return object itself `return this`


### Data Types
- Primitive types include`int, char, boolean`
- Standard class types included too `String, Array`
- Abstract data types can be created via classes and exist in the project folder

#### Primitive Types
- `int` - two's complement 16 bit integer
- `char` - unsigned 16 bit integer
- `boolean` - `true` or `false` expressed in 16 bits
- Weakly typed -  a value of any type can be assigned to a variable of any type without casting

#### Arrays
- Declared using standard OS class `Array`
- Elements accessed using `arr[i]`, index starting from 0
- 2D arrays are arrays of type array
- Declaration creates a reference, `new` creates the array proper `Array.new(arrayLength)`

#### Strings
- Arrays of `chars`
- Contents of a `String` object accessed using `charAt(index)`

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.4.png)
#### Object Types

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.3.png)

#### Type Conversions
- Weakly typed - any variable can be assigned any value type
- Compilers may check for any errors and perform the following assignments:

- `chars` can be assigned `ints` and vice versa

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.5.png)

- `ints` can be assigned references to objects (interpreted as a memory address)

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.6.png)

- `objects` can be assigned to `Arrays` and vice versa

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.7.png)

> WTF?

### Variables

![](docs/Images/figure_9.7.png)

- `static, local` variables must be initialised manually
- `field` variables initialised by constructor (usually)
- `parameter` variables initialised to values of arguments passed by caller

### Statements

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.8.png)

### Expressions
- One of the following
	- A `constant`
	- A `variable` name in scope - can be any of the 4 types
	- `this` denoting the current object
	- `arr[index]` denoting an element within an array
	- A `subroutine` call
- Can be prefixed with:
	- `-` for arithmetic negation
	- `~` for Boolean negation
- Can be combined using operators
	- `+ - * /` - integer arithmetic
	- `& |` - Boolean `AND / OR`
	- `<>=` - comparison
- Can be contained in parentheses `(expression)` for `BODMAS`
	- Parentheses must be used, otherwise expressions are evaluated left to right

```
8 - 2 * 3

If evaluated from left to right without considering any other rules:

1. First, you'd subtract: 8−2=6
2. Then, you'd multiply: 6∗3=18
```

### Subroutine Calls

```
className.subroutineName(arg1,arg2...)
```

- Must always use `()` even if no arguments
- Can call methods without implying `className` if already within a subroutine of that class

![](docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_9.9.png)

### Object Construction and Disposal
- Two stages
	1. A pointer to an object is declared
	2. Object's constructor is called with arguments to initialise `field` variables
- Constructed and assigned to variables using `let varName = className.constructur(args)`

```
let c = Cirlce.new(x,y,50);
```

- Can deconstruct objects using `Memory.deAlloc(object)`
	- Every class should include a `dispose()` method that deallocates the object

## Writing Jack Applications
- Careful planning required, see here: [[docs/Computer Science/Object Oriented Programming/Notes/3.1 Intro to OOP]]

### Compilation
- All files comprising the program exist in the same directory
- Translates `.jack` files into their corresponding `.vm` files
- The program folder containing `.vm` files can be loaded into the VM emulator
	- No need to bundle OS `vm` files as it comes bundled within the VM emulator

> *Also, you may wonder why the Jack syntax includes clunky keywords like do and let, why every subroutine must end with a return statement, why the language does not enforce operator priority, and so on—you may add your favorite complaint to the list. All these somewhat tedious idiosyncrasies were introduced into Jack with one purpose: allowing the development of simple and minimal Jack compilers*
