- A gate is a physical device that implements a simple Boolean function
- Gate diagrams for the three elementary logic gates:

## Primitive and Composite Gates
- Since all gates have binary inputs and outputs, they can be combined to make composite gates of arbitrary complexity
- For example, if we have 3 inputs of 1s and we need to determine if all are 1's, we can combine two and gates to achieve this:

![[docs/Images/figure_1.5.png]]

- From this diagram, we can see that gates can be viewed internally, where the logic is shown entirely, and externally, where the complexity of this logic is abstracted away
- For the XOR gate, we can see this in more detail:

![[docs/Images/figure_1.6.png]]

- This implementation can be realised in numerous ways, however the less gates used, the less cost, energy and faster the computation is

## Hardware Construction
- Building chips by hand is a messy, time consuming and error prone affair
- Designs are now completed using [[1.4 Hardware Description Language]]
	- Chip logic is defined inside a program, which is then subjected to tests
	- Iterations of designs and testing is conducted until the desired ratio of performance / cost is reached, in which case chips can start to be mass produced error free

## Specification
- Now that we have identified the Boolean functions used to build chips, we can specify their logic in the form of logic gates

### NAND

### NOT

### AND

### OR

### XOR

### Control Gates

#### Multiplexer
- Has three inputs, two input bits *a and b* and a selector bit *sel*
- The selector bit is used to select the value of either a or b to be output

![[docs/Images/figure_1.9.png]]

#### Demultiplexer
- Opposite of a multiplexer
- Selector tells which route an input should go through, the other value is set to 0

![[docs/Images/figure_1.10.png]]

### Multi Bit Gates
- A multi-bit gate is a logic gate that operates on multi-bit inputs and outputs. 
- For example, a 16-bit AND gate takes two 16-bit inputs and produces a 16-bit output, where each bit in the output is the AND of the corresponding bits in the input.

```hdl
CHIP And16 {
    IN a[16], b[16];
    OUT out[16];

    PARTS:
    And(a=a[0], b=b[0], out=out[0]);
    // Repeat for a[1] through a[15] and b[1] through b[15]
}
```

### Multi Way Gates
- A multi-way gate is a logic gate that operates across multiple inputs simultaneously. 
- For example, an 8-way OR gate takes an 8-bit input and produces a single-bit output, which is the OR of all 8 input bits.

- To implement a multi-way gate in HDL, you can create a new chip that uses multiple instances of a basic (single-bit) gate, cascading them to combine multiple inputs into a single output. For example, an 8-way OR gate (`Or8Way`) could be implemented as follows:

```hdl
CHIP Or8Way {
    IN in[8];
    OUT out;

    PARTS:
    Or(a=in[0], b=in[1], out=out1);
    // More Or chips to combine in[2] through in[7]
    Or(a=out1, b=out2, out=out);
}
```

## Implementation
- Now we can describe HOW these gates are implemented
- As we know already, every single gate can be made from AND, OR and NOT, and each of those can be made solely from NAND gates
- So, each implementation of a logic gate can be made solely from NAND gates (or NOR)

### NOT via NAND
- Recall, that in a NAND gate, one of the outputs must be false for the input to be true
- This means that if we make the two inputs equal, the output will be the opposite of the input
- This mimics the behaviour of the NOT gate (inverting the input)

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230728081904.png]]

### AND via NAND
- Remember that NAND is just the inverse of the AND gate
- This means we can just invert the output of a NAND gate via a NOT GATE
- We already know that a NOT gate can be made by connecting the inputs of a NAND GATE

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230728082540.png]]

### OR via NAND
- Combine the outputs of two NOT gates into a NAND gate
- Something about *De Morgan’s Theorem* that I don’t understand and don’t plan on understanding
