## Background
- Machine languages can be binary or symbolic
- Writing binary machine code is borderline impossible (or at least wildly inefficient)
- This is why we write machine code symbolically and use an assembler to convert it to binary
	- And later, a compiler to convert high level languages into assembly code
- The challenge with doing this:
	- Extract the programs semantics (what it does) from the source program, using the syntax (how it does it) of the source language
	- Re express the program's semantics in the target language, using the syntax of the target language
## Translating Assembly to Binary 
- Input a stream of assembly instructions and generate an output of binary instructions
- Output is loaded into computer memory and executed
- Assembler must handle instructions and symbols
### Handling Symbols
- Needs to read code twice, from start to end to handle jumps
	- In first read, assembler builds a *symbol* table which contains all the symbols in the code
	- In second read, assembler handles variable symbols and generates binary code using the symbol table

#### Predefined Symbols
- Are initialised before the assembler starts and have no special significance on their own
- Include:
	- Virtual Registers
		- `R0...R15` 
		- Are automatically predefined to RAM addresses `0..15`
	- I/O pointers
		- `SCREEN` and `KBD`
		- Are automatically predefined to RAM addresses `16384` and `24576` respectively
	- VM control pointers
		- `SP, LCL, ARG, THIS, THAT`
		- Predefined to refer to RAM addresses `0-4` (they overlap with virtual registers) 

#### User Defined Symbols
- Label Symbols `LOOP, END, etc`
	- Used to label destinations of jump commands
	- Declared by the pseudo command `xxx`. This directive defines the symbol `xxx` to refer to the instruction memory location holding the next command in the program 
- Variable Symbols
	- Any user defined symbol `xxx` appearing in an assembly program that is note defined elsewhere using the `xxx` directive is treated as a variable
	- The assembler automatically assigns each variable a unique RAM address, starting at RAM address 16
- Lowercase for variables and uppercase for labels and predefined symbols!

```assembly
// Predefined symbols:
// SP, LCL, ARG, THIS, THAT, R0-R15, SCREEN, KBD
// Note: R0-R15 are both registers and memory locations (0-15).

@R0               // Refers to register R0, which is also address 0.
D=M               // D gets the value from address 0

@R1               // Refers to register R1, which is also address 1.
M=D+1             // Value at address 1 gets D + 1

// User-defined symbols:

// Labels:
(LOOP_START)      // This is a user-defined label named "LOOP_START".
@R2
D=M
D=D-1
@R2
M=D
@END
D;JEQ             // If D is zero, jump to the label END.
@LOOP_START
0;JMP             // Unconditional jump to LOOP_START

(END)             // Another user-defined label named "END".

// Variables:
@myVar            // A user-defined variable named "myVar". The assembler will allocate a memory location for this.
M=123

@myVar
D=M
@SCREEN           // Predefined symbol referring to the base address of the screen memory map.
M=D               // Write the value from myVar to the start of the screen (just for demonstration, doesn't achieve much visually).
```

## How do we achieve this?

- Call `HackAssembler` with `<progname>.asm` in the terminal, to output `progname.hack` with binary code
- Consists of three modules:
	- Parse module to parse input into instructions and instructions into fields
	- Code module for translating fields into binary codes
	- Assembler program to drive everything

### Parse Module
- Advances through source, skips comments / white space and breaks each symbolic instruction down into it's underlying components

![[docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_6.1.png]]

### Code Module
- Translates each field created by the parsing module into a 16bit binary code

![[docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_6.2.png]]

### Hack Assembler
- Drives previous two modules
- Basic version assumes no symbolic references
	- All instructions are of type `@xxx` where `x` are numbers only
	- Input file contains no label instructions
	1. Get name of file from command line arguments
	2. Constructs objects for modules
	3. Creates output file
	4. For each C instruction:
		1. Enter a loop that iterates through each line and process them:
			1. Use parse module to break instructions into fields
			2. Use code module to translate each field
		2. Concatenate translated binary intro a string of 16 binary chars and writes this string as the next line
	5. For each A instruction:
		1. Translate into binary representation consisting of 16 binary chars and writes this string as the next line

### Symbol Table
- Must resolve symbols into actual addresses using a table
- Achieved using a hash table `<key, value>` 

![[docs/Images/figure_wo_caption_6.3.png]]

## Implementation
- Using these modules, we can translate assembly into machine code
1. Parse instruction into fields
2. For each field, generate corresponding bit code
3. If instruction contains a symbolic reference, convert symbol into it's numeric value
4. Assemble resulting binary into strings of sixteen bits (1 word)
5. Write assembled string to output file

### Initialisation
- Create an empty symbol table and initialise it with predefined symbols
### First Pass
- Go through the source code without generating any machine code
	- For each label declaration `LABEL`, add the pair `<LABEL, n>` to the symbol table where n is the location of the next instruction in ROM
		- Note, we only do this for labels, not variables
### Second Pass
- Go through the source code again and process each line:
	- If the line is a C instruction - translate it into 16 bit instruction according to each field `DEST=COMP;JMP`
		- Note, 2 bits after op code are always `11`
	- If the line is an A instruction `@xxx`:
		- where `xxx` is a number, translate `xxx` into 15 bit binary to get the address
		- where `xxx` is a symbol, look it up in the symbol table and proceed as follows:
			- If found, replace it with its numeric value and complete the instruction
			- If not found, then it must represent a new variable:
				- Add the pair `<xxx, n>` to the symbol table, where n is the next available RAM address (recall, we have predefined symbols up to register 15), and complete the instruction

##### Example 

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230822103522.png]]

```
@7
- A instruction, therefore op code is 0
- translate 7 into 15 bit binary, which is 0000000...111
```

```
D=0
- C instruction, therefore op code is 1
- computation is =0, therefore a bit is 0 and comp field is 101010
- destination is D only, therefore dest field is 010
- no jump needed, so jump field is 0000
```

```
0;JMP
- C instruction, therefore op code is 1
- computation is =0, therefore a bit is 0 and comp field is 101010
- no storing anywhere, therefore dest field is 000
- performing unconditional jump, therefore jump field is 111
```

```
A=D&M;JLT
- C instruction, therefore op code is 1
- computation is D&M, therefore a bit is 1 and comp field is 000000
- storing in A, therefore dest field is 100
- performing less than jump, therefore jump field is 100
```

```
@BOB (assuming BOB=31)
- A instruction, therefore op code is 0
- Set remaining 15 bits to value of bob (which can be found using the symbol table) = 31
```

```
AD=!M
- C instruction, therefore op code is 1
- Computation is !M, therefore comp field is 110001
- Storing in AD, therefore dest field is 110
- No jump, so jump field is 000
```

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230815121257.png]]

```
	@KBD
	D=M
	@48
	D=D-A
	@num
	M=D
(END)
	@END
	0;JMP
```

- Reads the keyboard code at the time of the first `D=M` command and subtracts 48 from it and puts the result in `num`

```
	@pix
	M=1
	D=M
	M=M+D
	M=M+1
	D=M
	M=M+D
	M=M+1
	D=M
	@SCREEN
	M=D
(END)
	@END
	0;JMP
```

 - We set the value of `SCREEN` to be 7, and this in binary is `0000...000111`, which means it draws the top left most three pixels on the screen black
