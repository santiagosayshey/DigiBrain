> [!exercise] Question 2: Virtual to Physical Address Translation
> A certain computer provides its user with 2^32 bytes of virtual memory and 2^22 bytes of physical memory. The page size is 4,096 bytes. A process requests a read of address 11123456. Explain how the system establishes the corresponding physical location, distinguishing between software and hardware operations.

> [!exercise] Question 3: Page Replacement Algorithms
> Consider the following page reference string:
> 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6.
> 
> How many page faults would occur for the following replacement algorithms, assuming we have only three memory frames? How many if we increase the memory to 5 frames?
> • LRU replacement
> • FIFO replacement
> • Optimal replacement
> 
> Remember all frames are initially empty so your first unique pages will all cost one fault each.
