> [!idea] System Calls: Bridge Between User and Kernel
> System calls are the **interface between user programs and the kernel**. They allow c**ontrolled access to privileged operations** and hardware resources.
> 
> Key aspects:
> 1. **Mechanism**: Uses special CPU instructions to switch from user to kernel mode
> 2. **Purpose**: Enables user programs to request services requiring higher privileges
> 3. **Examples**: File operations, process creation, network access
> 4. **Security**: Provides a controlled, limited entry point to kernel functionality
> 
> Process:
> 1. User program prepares system call number and arguments
> 2. CPU switches to kernel mode
> 3. Kernel performs requested operation
> 4. CPU returns to user mode with result

> [!example] System Call Process: `read()`
> Let's walk through how a process P calls the `read()` system call:
> 
> 1. **Process P in User Mode**:
>    - P wants to call `read()` but can't access it directly
>    - P can only see its own memory due to user mode restrictions
>    - P creates a buffer in its own memory space for the read operation
> 
> 2. **System Call Preparation**:
>    - P prepares for system call using a predefined interface:
>      ```assembly
>      movl $6, %eax    ; Load system call number for read() into EAX
>      int $64          ; Use trap table entry 64 with `int`errupt to enter kernel mode
>      ```
>    - Explanation:
>      - EAX is the 32-bit accumulator register in x86 architecture
>      - `$6` is the index in the syscall table for `read()`
>      - `$64` is the index in the trap table for system calls
> 
> 3. **Transition to Kernel Mode**:
>    - The `int $64` instruction causes a trap to the kernel
>    - CPU switches to kernel mode, giving full system access
>    - The kernel can now access the EAX register to determine which system call to execute
> 
> 4. **Kernel Handling**:
>    - Kernel reads the system call number from EAX (6 in this case)
>    - Looks up this number in its syscall table
>    - Jumps to the appropriate handler for `read()`
>    - Kernel can now access user memory to fill the user buffer
>      - This is possible because the kernel can see and modify all memory
> 
> 5. **Return to User Mode**:
>    - After `read()` operation completes, kernel prepares to return
>    - Uses a return-from-trap instruction to switch back to user mode
>    - Control returns to Process P, with the read data now in the buffer in the process's memory

> [!consider]- Security Implications of System Calls
> System calls, while essential for OS functionality, present significant security challenges:
> 
> 1. **Privileged Access**:
>    - Kernel mode operations have unrestricted access to system resources
>    - Potential for unintended or malicious system-wide changes
> 
> 2. **Vulnerability Surface**:
>    - Each system call is a potential entry point for attacks
>    - Even minor flaws can lead to system-wide compromises
> 
> 3. **Input Validation**:
>    - Crucial to thoroughly verify all parameters passed from user space
>    - Risks include memory corruption, privilege escalation, and data leaks
> 
> 4. **Return State Verification**:
>    - Ensure system state after call execution aligns with expected outcomes
>    - Prevent unauthorized changes or unexpected side effects
> 
> Robust security measures and continuous auditing of system call implementations are vital to maintain system integrity and prevent exploitation.
