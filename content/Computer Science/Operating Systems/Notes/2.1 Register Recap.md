> [!consider] CPU Registers in System Calls
> Registers are small, fast storage locations **within the CPU used for quick data access** and manipulation during program execution.
> 
> In system calls, registers play crucial roles:
> - Passing system call numbers and arguments
> - Storing return values
> - Maintaining program state during mode switches

> | Technical Name | Register | Purpose in System Calls |
> |----------------|----------|-------------------------|
> | Accumulator    | EAX      | System call number, return value |
> | Base           | EBX      | 1st argument |
> | Counter        | ECX      | 2nd argument |
> | Data           | EDX      | 3rd argument |
> | Source Index   | ESI      | 4th argument |
> | Destination Index | EDI   | 5th argument |
> | Base Pointer   | EBP      | Frame pointer (stack management) |
> | Stack Pointer  | ESP      | Top of stack |
> 
> During a system call:
> 1. User mode sets Accumulator (EAX) with syscall number
> 2. Arguments loaded into other registers or pushed onto stack
> 3. Kernel accesses these registers to perform requested operation
> 4. Kernel places return value in Accumulator (EAX) before returning to user mode
> 
> This register usage ensures efficient data transfer between user and kernel modes.
