> [!motivation] Concurrency Within Concurrency
> As programs became more complex, a new challenge emerged:
> 
> - **Programs often need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously**
> - These tasks may share resources and data
> - Creating separate processes for each task is resource-intensive
> - Switching between processes has significant overhead
> 
> A more lightweight solution was needed to achieve **concurrency within a single program**, leading to the development of threads.

> [!idea] Threads
> A thread is a **subset of a process** that:
> 
> - Represents an **independent sequence of instructions**
> - **Shares the process's resources** (memory space, open files)
> - Has its own:
>   - Program counter
>   - Register set
>   - Stack
> 
> Threads enable concurrent execution within a single process, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously while sharing a common set of resources.

> Visualize: In our railway analogy, threads are like **multiple tracks that split from a single main track**:
> - The main railway line represents the process
> - The split tracks represent individual threads
> - Each track has its own signals and switches (program counter, registers)
> - The tracks eventually merge back into the main line, completing the process


> [!consider] Processes vs. Threads
> | Aspect | Processes | Threads |
> |--------|-----------|---------|
> | Resource Ownership | Own separate resources | Share process resources |
> | Memory Space | Separate | Shared |
> | Creation Overhead | Higher | Lower |
> | Context Switch Time | Longer | Shorter |
> | Communication | Inter-process communication (IPC) | Direct access to shared memory |
> | Isolation | Strong | Weaker |
> | Scalability | Limited by system resources | More scalable within a process |
> 
> Processes provide stronger isolation but with higher overhead, while threads offer lighter-weight concurrency within a shared context. The choice between processes and threads depends on the specific requirements of the application, balancing factors such as isolation, resource usage, and performance.

This structure provides a motivation for threads, introduces the concept, and then compares threads to processes to highlight their differences and use cases.
