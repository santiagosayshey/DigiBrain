> [!idea] Scheduling: Deciding Which Process Runs Next
> Scheduling is the **strategy used to determine which process should be dispatched to run next**. It involves:
> 
> - Maintaining a **queue of ready-to-run processes**
> - **Selecting the next process** based on a scheduling algorithm
> - **Balancing system objectives** (e.g., fairness, throughput, response time)
> 
> Key concepts:
> 1. **Scheduling Algorithms**: Methods for selecting the next process (e.g., Round Robin, Priority Scheduling)
> 2. **Preemption**: Ability to interrupt a running process to schedule another
> 
> Scheduling aims to **optimize system performance and ensure fair allocation** of CPU time among processes.

> [!example] Scheduling in Practice
> Consider three processes: A, B, and C, with a Round Robin scheduler
> 
> 1. Scheduler **starts with A**, gives it a time slice
> 2. After time slice expires, **A is preempted, B is scheduled**
> 3. B runs for its time slice, then **C is scheduled**
> 4. After C's time slice, the **cycle repeats with A**
> 
> This ensures each process gets regular CPU time, preventing any single process from monopolizing the processor.
