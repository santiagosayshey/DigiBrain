> [!idea] Scheduling: Deciding Which Process Runs Next
> Scheduling is the **strategy used to determine which process should be dispatched to run next**. It involves:
> 
> - Maintaining a **queue of ready-to-run processes**
> - **Selecting the next process** based on a scheduling algorithm
> - **Balancing system objectives** (e.g., fairness, throughput, response time, turnaround time, waiting time, utilisation, overhead)
> 
> Key concepts:
> 1. **Scheduling Algorithms**: Methods for selecting the next process (e.g., Round Robin, Priority Scheduling)
> 2. **Preemption**: Ability to interrupt a running process to schedule another
> 
> Scheduling aims to **optimize system performance and ensure fair allocation** of CPU time among processes.

> [!example] General Scheduling
> Consider three processes: A, B, and C, with a Round Robin scheduler
> 
> 1. Scheduler **starts with A**, gives it a time slice
> 2. After time slice expires, **A is preempted, B is scheduled**
> 3. B runs for its time slice, then **C is scheduled**
> 4. After C's time slice, the **cycle repeats with A**
> 
> This ensures each process gets regular CPU time, preventing any single process from monopolizing the processor.

idea callout for state transitions, recapping idea from dispatching

vocab idea table for workload, jon, scheduluer and metric. talk about each type of metric and how to calculate them. give examples

Minimize turnaround time – Completion_time – arrival_time  
Minimize response time – Initial_schedule_time – arrival_time  
Minimize waiting time – Do not want to spend much time in Ready queue  
Maximize throughput – Want many jobs to complete per unit of time  
Maximize resource utilization – Keep expensive devices busy  
Minimize overhead – Reduce number of context switches  
Maximize fairness – All jobs get same amount of CPU over some time interva

> [!consider] Consider
> We have certain information we know about jobs: arrival time and run time
> We have some schedulers we want to try: FIFO, SJK, STCF, RR
> We judge each scheduler by comparing the turnaround and response time of each job for each scheduler


We judge schedulers by working through  a list of assumptions - same running time, arrive at same time, no I/o and determined run time. We remove each assumption and work through, determining metrics.
