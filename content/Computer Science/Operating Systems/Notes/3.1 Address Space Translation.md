> [!motivation] Motivation
> Modern computer systems need to manage memory efficiently for multiple processes. Consider:
> - Multiple applications running simultaneously
> - Limited physical memory compared to total memory needs
> - Need for memory protection between processes
> - Desire for flexibility in memory allocation
> These challenges require a system to **map between the memory addresses programs use and the actual physical memory locations.**

> [!idea] Address Space Translation
> Address space translation maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.
> - **Virtual address**: Memory location as seen by a process
> - **Physical address**: Actual location in hardware memory
> - Translation process:
>   1. CPU generates virtual address
>   2. Memory Management Unit (MMU) translates to physical address
>   3. Physical memory accessed at translated address
> - Benefits:
>   - Memory isolation between processes
>   - Efficient use of physical memory
>   - Support for virtual memory (using disk as extension of RAM)

Certainly. I'll create an example callout to illustrate address space translation in action.

> [!example] Address Space Translation in Practice
> Consider a system with 4 KB pages and the following scenario:
> 
> 1. Process generates virtual address: 0x5678
> 2. MMU translates using page table:
> 
>    | Virtual Page | Physical Page |
>    |--------------|---------------|
>    | 0x5000       | 0xA000        |
> 3. Translation process:
>    - Page number: 0x5 (from 0x5678)
>    - Offset: 0x678
>    - Translated page: 0xA000
>    - Final physical address: 0xA678
> 
> This example shows how a virtual address (0x5678) is translated to a physical address (0xA678), allowing the process to operate with its own address space while the MMU handles the mapping to actual memory locations.

A diagram showing:
1. A process with its virtual address space (highlight address 0x5678)
2. An arrow pointing to the MMU
3. The MMU with a simplified page table as shown in the example
4. Another arrow pointing to physical memory
5. Physical memory with the translated address (0xA678) highlighted
