> [!motivation] Motivation
> Modern computer systems need to manage memory efficiently for multiple processes. Consider:
> - Multiple applications running simultaneously
> - Limited physical memory compared to total memory needs
> - Need for memory protection between processes
> - Desire for flexibility in memory allocation
> These challenges require a system to map between the memory addresses programs use and the actual physical memory locations.

> [!idea] Address Space Translation
> Address space translation maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.
> - **Virtual address**: Memory location as seen by a process
> - **Physical address**: Actual location in hardware memory
> - Translation process:
>   1. CPU generates virtual address
>   2. Memory Management Unit (MMU) translates to physical address
>   3. Physical memory accessed at translated address
> - Benefits:
>   - Memory isolation between processes
>   - Efficient use of physical memory
>   - Support for virtual memory (using disk as extension of RAM)
