> [!motivation] Motivation
> Modern computer systems face a challenge:
> - Programs need to access memory using addresses
> - 64-bit systems can theoretically address $2^{64}$ bytes (16 exabytes)
> - But physical memory (RAM) is much smaller, typically gigabytes
> How can we allow programs to use large address spaces while efficiently using limited physical memory?

> [!idea] Virtualizing Physical Memory
> Address space translation **virtualizes physical memory** to create the illusion of a vast, contiguous memory space:
> - **Programs operate in their own virtual address space:**
>   - Each program perceives a complete and contiguous memory space, often utilizing the full range of 64-bit addresses (up to 16 exabytes).
> - **The operating system and hardware manage the illusion:**
>   - Virtual addresses are translated to physical memory locations, with only a portion of the virtual addresses mapping to physical memory at any given time.
> - **Key benefits include:**
>   - **Memory isolation:** Each program has its own protected "virtual" memory, preventing interference between programs.
>   - **Efficient memory use:** Physical memory is dynamically allocated and shared among multiple programs, maximizing resource utilization.
>   - **Flexibility:** Data can be seamlessly moved between memory and disk, ensuring that even limited physical memory is used effectively.
>
> **Key concept:** Programs operate under the assumption of vast memory availability, while the system efficiently manages the limited physical resources behind the scenes.
