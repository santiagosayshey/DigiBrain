new note on smaller page tables please

motivation - even with LTBs, paging has some major disadvantages
- additional memory reference on cache misses, very inefficienct
- lots of storage needed for page tables
	- massive tables, even if they're not being fully allocated
	- how do we avoid storing null data and reduce page table size?
	  
	  
	  
ideas (please explain more clearly than i have here.)
- inverted page tables
	- keep a single page table with an entry for each physical page in the system (rather than virtual pages)
	- map the virtual pages to this physical page
	- used with hashring table
- segmented page tables
	- divide address space into segments (code, heap, stack)
	- divide each segment into fixed size pages, each segment has a table of its own
	- advantages
		- supports sparse addres spaces
		- decreases size of page tables
		- if segment not used, no need for page table
		- increased flexibility
- multilevel page tables
	- page the page tables
	- page the page tables of page tables....

examples for each of those alternatives
