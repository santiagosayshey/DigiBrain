> [!motivation] Addressing the Disadvantages of Paging
> Even with the use of Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs), paging still has some significant drawbacks that can impact system performance and memory usage:
> 1. **Additional Memory References**: When a TLB miss occurs, the system needs to access the page table in memory to fetch the required translation. This additional memory reference can be costly, especially if the page table is large and the miss rate is high, leading to increased memory access latency and reduced performance.
> 2. **Page Table Storage Overhead**: Page tables can consume a significant amount of memory, particularly for large virtual address spaces. Even if not all virtual pages are actively used, the page table needs to allocate entries for the entire virtual address space, resulting in wasted memory space. Storing and managing these large page tables can be a challenge, especially in systems with limited memory resources.
> 
> To address these issues, several alternative page table structures and techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of page tables and improve performance.

> [!idea] Inverted Page Tables
> Inverted page tables are an alternative approach to traditional page tables that aim to **reduce the storage overhead**. **Instead of maintaining a page table for each process, a single system-wide page table is used, with an entry for each physical page in the system.**
> - In an inverted page table, each entry contains information about the virtual page number and the process identifier (PID) associated with the physical page.
> - When a virtual address needs to be translated, the system searches the inverted page table to find the entry that matches the virtual page number and PID.
> - To speed up the search process, inverted page tables are often used in conjunction with a hash table. The virtual page number and PID are hashed to determine the starting point for the search in the inverted page table.
> 
> Advantages of inverted page tables:
> - Reduced storage overhead, as only one entry is needed for each physical page, regardless of the number of processes.
> - Efficient use of memory, as the page table size is proportional to the number of physical pages rather than the size of the virtual address space.
> 
> Disadvantages of inverted page tables:
> - Increased complexity in searching for the matching entry, as the entire inverted page table may need to be searched in the worst case.
> - Potential performance impact due to the search process, especially if the inverted page table is large.

> [!idea] Segmented Page Tables
> Segmented page tables combine the concepts of segmentation and paging to provide a more flexible and efficient memory management scheme. In this approach, the virtual address space is divided into segments, such as code, heap, and stack, and each segment is further divided into fixed-size pages.
> - Each segment has its own page table, which maps the virtual pages within that segment to physical pages.
> - The segment base address and size are stored in a separate segment table, which is used to locate the corresponding page table for a given virtual address.
> 
> Advantages of segmented page tables:
> - Support for sparse address spaces, as only the page tables for the used segments need to be allocated.
> - Reduced page table sizes, as each segment's page table only needs to cover the virtual pages within that segment.
> - Flexibility in memory allocation, as different segments can have different page table sizes and structures based on their specific requirements.
> - Efficient memory usage, as unused segments do not require page tables, saving memory space.
> 
> Disadvantages of segmented page tables:
> - Potential for large page tables if a segment has a large number of pages.
> - Increased complexity in managing multiple page tables and the segment table.
> - Need for contiguous allocation of each segment's page table, which can lead to memory fragmentation.

> [!idea] Multi-level Page Tables
> Multi-level page tables address the issue of large page table sizes by introducing a hierarchical structure. The idea is to divide the page table into smaller, more manageable parts and use multiple levels of indirection to locate the desired entry.
> - The virtual address is split into multiple parts, each representing an index into a different level of the page table hierarchy.
> - The top-level page table, known as the page directory, contains entries that point to second-level page tables.
> - The second-level page tables, in turn, contain entries that point to the actual physical pages or to further levels of page tables.
> - This process continues until the final level of the page table hierarchy is reached, which contains the actual physical page number.
> 
> Advantages of multi-level page tables:
> - Reduced memory overhead, as only the necessary portions of the page table hierarchy need to be allocated and stored in memory.
> - Efficient use of memory, as unused portions of the virtual address space do not require page table entries.
> - Flexibility in managing large virtual address spaces by distributing the page table across multiple levels.
> 
> Disadvantages of multi-level page tables:
> - Increased memory access latency, as multiple levels of the page table hierarchy need to be traversed to locate the physical page number.
> - Complexity in managing and maintaining the multi-level structure, especially when dealing with large and sparse virtual address spaces.

> [!example] Inverted Page Table Example
> Consider a system with 4 GB of physical memory and a page size of 4 KB. An inverted page table would have 1 million entries (4 GB / 4 KB), each containing information about the virtual page number and the associated process identifier (PID).
> 
> When a virtual address needs to be translated, the system hashes the virtual page number and PID to determine the starting point for the search in the inverted page table. It then searches the table for a matching entry to find the corresponding physical page number.

> [!example] Segmented Page Table Example
> Suppose a system has a virtual address space divided into three segments: code, heap, and stack. Each segment has its own page table, and the segment table stores the base address and size of each segment.
> 
> When a virtual address is generated, the system first determines the segment based on the virtual address. It then uses the segment table to locate the corresponding page table for that segment. The page table is then used to translate the virtual page number within the segment to the physical page number.

> [!example] Multi-level Page Table Example
> Consider a system with a 32-bit virtual address space and a 4 KB page size. The virtual address is divided into three parts: a 10-bit page directory index, a 10-bit page table index, and a 12-bit page offset.
> 
> The top-level page table (page directory) has 1024 entries (2^10), each pointing to a second-level page table. Each second-level page table also has 1024 entries, each pointing to a physical page.
> 
> To translate a virtual address, the system first uses the page directory index to locate the appropriate second-level page table. It then uses the page table index to find the entry in the second-level page table, which contains the physical page number. Finally, the page offset is added to the physical page number to obtain the complete physical address.
