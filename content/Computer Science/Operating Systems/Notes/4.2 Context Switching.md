lets do some notes on context switching in the context of TLB

consider - what happens if a process uses cached TLB entries from another process (not quite what this means, can you clarify this consideration) i think it means that they share the same physical frame and the TLB thinks we can go to that one instead?

idea - solutions
1. flush TLB on each switch
	1. really costly as we loss all recently cached transitions
2. Track which entries are for which processes
	1. address space identifier

example
- show two processes accessing the same TLB, columns for VPN, PFN, valid, prot and ASID (what we use to say which entry belongs to which process. also dont use my acronyms. say what they are = virtual page number)
- its useful to share PFNs (frames) to reduce number of frames in use. but we need to say which entries belong to which pages, otherwise we get processes accessing things they shouldnt be
