> [!motivation] Automation
> The evolution of computing systems reflects a drive towards automation, aiming to increase efficiency and reduce human intervention:
> 
> - **Switchboard Era**: 
>   - Operators manually connected calls by plugging wires into switchboards
>   - Limited scalability due to human cognitive and physical constraints
> 
> - **Early Computer Systems**:
>   - Operators manually loaded programs and data using punch cards or paper tape
>   - Managed system resources (memory, CPU time, I/O devices) by hand
>   - Inefficient use of expensive hardware as systems idled between tasks
> 
> - **Need for Automation**:
>   - Growing complexity and demand for computing power
>   - Requirement for faster task switching and resource allocation
>   - Desire to maximize hardware utilization
> 
> This progression highlights the need for **a system that can automate resource management, task scheduling, and system control** - laying the groundwork for the development of operating systems.


> [!idea] Operating Systems: The Computer's Manager
> An operating system (OS) is software that **manages computer hardware and software resources**, providing common services for computer programs.
> 
> Key functions:
> - Resource management: **Allocates** CPU time, memory, storage, and I/O devices
> - Process management: **Schedules** and coordinates running programs
> - Memory management: **Controls memory** allocation and deallocation
> - File system management: Organizes and **controls access** to stored data
> - User interface: Provides means for users to **interact** with the computer
> 
> Purpose:
> - **Abstracts hardware** complexity from users and applications
> - Enables efficient use of computer resources
> - Provides a stable, consistent environment for running applications
> - Ensures security and separation between users and processes
> 
> **Visualise**: An OS functions like a skilled **orchestra conductor, coordinating various components** (instruments) to work harmoniously, managing resources (musicians' time and energy), and interpreting between the score (user inputs) and the performance (computer operations).
