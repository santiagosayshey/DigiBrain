> [!motivation] The Need for Process Abstraction
> Early computer systems could **only** **run one program at a time**, leading to inefficient use of resources. As computing needs grew, several challenges emerged:
> 
> - Running **multiple** programs simultaneously
> - Efficiently **sharing** limited system resources
> - Protecting **programs** from interfering with each other
> - Maximizing CPU utilization
> 
> To address these challenges, operating systems needed to **virtualize the CPU**. This means:
> - Creating the illusion that each program has exclusive access to the CPU
> - Rapidly switching the CPU between different programs
> - Maintaining the state of each program when not actively running

> [!consider] Approaches to CPU Virtualization
> Operating systems use different strategies to virtualize the CPU:
> 
> 1. **Direct Execution**:
>    - OS creates process and transfers control to starting point (e.g., main())
>    - Allows user process to run directly on hardware
>    - Problems:
>      - No restrictions (could access files, read/write other process data)
>      - Process could run forever (if slow, buggy, or malicious)
>      - No way to handle slow operations (like I/O)
> 
> 2. **Limited Direct Execution**:
>    - Uses hardware support (e.g., protection modes, timer interrupts)
>    - Kernel mode for privileged operations, user mode for application code
>    - Timer interrupts allow OS to regain control periodically
>    - System calls for restricted operations (file access, I/O)
>    - Enables time-sharing and protection between processes
> 
> These approaches balance efficient execution with necessary OS control, forming the basis for modern process management.

> [!idea] Processes
> A process is an execution stream with an associated process state, representing **a program in active execution**. Multiple independen**t instances of the same program can run as distinct processes**. Each process operates under the **illusion that it has exclusive use of the CPU**, unaware of other processes competing for the same resources.

> - **Execution Stream**: The sequence of instructions being executed
> - **Process State**: The current status of the process, including:
>   - Program Counter (PC): Points to the next instruction to execute
>   - Register values: Holds intermediate computation results
>   - Memory allocation: Stack and heap for program data
>   - I/O status information: Open files, network connections
> 
> Process Lifecycle:
> - New: Process is being created
> - Ready: Waiting to be assigned to a processor
> - Running: Instructions are being executed
> - Waiting: Process is waiting for some event to occur
> - Terminated: Process has finished execution
> 
> Visualize: In our traffic control analogy, a **process is like a train on the railway** system:
> - The train represents the program in execution
> - Its current position on the track is the Program Counter
> - The cargo it carries represents the data in memory
> - Stations along the route represent different states in the process lifecycle
> - The traffic controller (OS) manages multiple trains, ensuring they all progress efficiently without colliding
> 
> The operating system, like a skilled traffic controller, manages these processes, switching between them to create the illusion of concurrent movement on a limited track system.

> [!consider] Process Creation: From Static Code to Execution
> When a program transitions from static code to an executing process:
> 
> 1. **Code Loading**:
>    - OS reads program code from file system
>    - Copies code into memory (usually not overwriting existing code)
> 
> 2. **Memory Allocation**:
>    - Creates memory space for process (stack, heap)
>    - Initializes stack with basic execution context
> 
> 3. **Library Linking**:
>    - Links necessary libraries (dynamic or static)
>    - Resolves external references
> 
> 4. **Process Control Block Creation**:
>    - OS creates PCB to track process state
> 
> 5. **Scheduling**:
>    - Process added to ready queue for execution
> 
> This process transforms static code into an active execution stream with associated state information.
