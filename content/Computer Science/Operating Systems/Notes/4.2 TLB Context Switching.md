> [!consider] TLB and Context Switching
> When a **context switch** occurs between processes, it's **important to ensure that the TLB entries from the previous process do not interfere with the execution of the newly scheduled process**. If the TLB contains entries that belong to a different process, it can lead to incorrect address translations and potential security issues.
> 
> The **problem arises when two processes share the same physical frame but have different virtual-to-physical mappings**. If the TLB contains an entry from the previous process that maps a virtual page to the shared physical frame, the new process **might incorrectly access the data belonging to the previous process**, violating process isolation and causing erroneous behavior.

> [!idea] Solutions for TLB Management during Context Switches
> To address the issue of TLB entries from different processes interfering with each other, two common approaches are used:
> 
> 1. **Flushing the TLB on Context Switch**:
>    - One solution is to flush the entire TLB whenever a context switch occurs.
>    - Flushing the TLB ensures that all the entries belonging to the previous process are removed, preventing any interference with the new process.
>    - However, this approach can be costly in terms of performance, as it requires repopulating the TLB with new entries for the current process, resulting in a high number of TLB misses initially.
> 
> 2. **Tracking Process-Specific TLB Entries**:
>    - An alternative approach is to associate each TLB entry with a process-specific identifier, such as an Address Space Identifier (ASID).
>    - Each process is assigned a unique ASID, and the TLB entries are tagged with the corresponding ASID of the process that created them.
>    - During a context switch, the TLB entries are not flushed entirely. Instead, only the entries associated with the previous process's ASID are considered invalid.
>    - The new process can continue to use the TLB entries tagged with its own ASID, avoiding the need to flush the entire TLB.
>    - This approach allows for more efficient TLB management during context switches, as it reduces the number of TLB misses and avoids the overhead of complete TLB flushes.

> [!example] TLB with Address Space Identifiers (ASIDs)
> Consider a scenario where two processes, Process A and Process B, are accessing the same TLB. The TLB has columns for the Virtual Page Number (VPN), Physical Frame Number (PFN), Valid bit, Protection bits, and Address Space Identifier (ASID).
> 
> | VPN | PFN | Valid | Protection | ASID |
> |-----|-----|-------|------------|------|
> | 10  | 100 | 1     | Read-Write | A    |
> | 20  | 100 | 1     | Read       | B    |
> | 30  | 300 | 1     | Read-Write | A    |
> | 40  | 400 | 1     | Read       | B    |
> 
> In this example, Process A and Process B share the same physical frames (PFN 100) but have different virtual-to-physical mappings. The ASID column distinguishes the TLB entries belonging to each process.
> 
> When a context switch occurs from Process A to Process B, the TLB entries with ASID A are marked as invalid, while the entries with ASID B remain valid. This allows Process B to continue using its own TLB entries without interference from Process A's entries.
> 
> Using ASIDs enables efficient sharing of physical frames among processes while maintaining process isolation and preventing unauthorized access to memory.
