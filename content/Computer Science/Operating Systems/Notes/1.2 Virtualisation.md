> [!motivation] The Need for Process Abstraction
> Early computer systems could only **run one program at a time**, leading to inefficient use of resources. As computing needs grew, several challenges emerged:
> 
> - Running **multiple** programs simultaneously
> - Efficiently **sharing** limited system resources
> - Protecting **programs** from interfering with each other
> - Maximizing CPU utilization
> 
> These challenges drove the development of more sophisticated ways to manage program execution, laying the groundwork for modern **process management** in operating systems.
