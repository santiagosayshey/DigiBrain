> [!idea] Paging: A Solution to Fragmentation
> Paging is a memory management scheme that **eliminates the need for contiguous physical memory allocation**.
> 
> **Key concepts and process:**
> 1. **Division of memory:**
>    - **Physical memory** is divided into fixed-size blocks called "frames". Referenced using Page Frame Number (PFN)
>    - **Logical memory** (process space) is divided into same-size blocks called "pages". Refeerences using VPN (Virt)
> 
> 2. **Allocation and page table:**
>    - When a process is created, it's assigned a single page table
>    - Process's pages are stored in any available frames, not necessarily contiguous
>    - The page table acts as an index, showing which page corresponds to which frame 
> 
> 3. **Address translation:**
>    - CPU generates virtual addresses
>    - Memory Management Unit (MMU) splits address into page number and offset
>    - Page number is used to index the page table, finding the frame number
>    - Frame number is combined with offset to get physical address

> **Benefits:**
> - Eliminates external fragmentation
> - Simplifies memory allocation and deallocation
> - Enables efficient use of physical memory
> - Facilitates shared memory and memory protection
> 
> **Challenges:**
> - May introduce internal fragmentation within pages
> - Requires additional memory for page tables
> - Adds complexity to address translation process
> 
> This system allows processes to operate as if they have contiguous memory, while physically being scattered across different frames.

> [!consider] Paging: The Library Analogy
> Think of paging like organizing books in a library:
> 
> - **Books** = Programs
> - **Pages of a book** = Pages of a program
> - **Library shelves** = Physical memory frames
> - **Library catalog** = Page table
> 
> In this analogy:
> - Books are split into individual pages (like programs into memory pages)
> - Pages are stored on shelves in any available slot (like pages in any available frame)
> - The catalog tells you where to find each page of a book (like the page table mapping virtual to physical addresses)
> - You can easily add or remove books without reorganizing the entire library (like allocating or freeing memory without compaction)
> 
> This system allows efficient use of shelf space and easy management of books, just as paging allows efficient use of memory and easy management of programs.

> [!example] Paging in Action
> Let's consider a simple scenario with a 32-byte process in a system with 16-byte pages/frames.
> 
> **Process memory (virtual addresses):**
> ```
> +----------------+----------------+
> |  Page 0 (0-15) |  Page 1 (16-31)|
> +----------------+----------------+
> ```
> 
> **Physical memory:**
> ```
> +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
> | Frame 0 (Free) | Frame 1 (Used) | Frame 2 (Free) | Frame 3 (Used) |
> +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
> ```
> 
> **Page Table:**
> ```
> Virtual Page | Physical Frame
>      0       |      2
>      1       |      0
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> - The process's Page 0 is stored in Frame 2
> - The process's Page 1 is stored in Frame 0
> - Frames 1 and 3 might be used by other processes
> 
> When the CPU needs to access address 18 (on Page 1):
> 1. It calculates: Page number = 18 / 16 = 1, Offset = 18 % 16 = 2
> 2. It looks up Page 1 in the page table, finding Frame 0
> 3. It accesses physical address: Page start + offset = 16 + 2 = 18
> 
> This demonstrates how paging allows non-contiguous memory allocation while maintaining the illusion of contiguous addresses for the process.

> [!consider] Paging: Further Considerations
> As you think about paging, you might wonder about several aspects:
> 
> **1. Page Size:**
> - Typically ranges from 4KB to 4MB in modern systems
> - Smaller pages:
>   - Less internal fragmentation
>   - More pages per process, larger page tables
> - Larger pages:
>   - Smaller page tables, faster translation
>   - More internal fragmentation
> - OS may support multiple page sizes (e.g., huge pages for databases)
> 
> **2. Page Table Storage:**
> - Stored in main memory
> - Each process has its own page table
> - For large address spaces, page tables can be very large
> - Solutions for large page tables:
>   - Multi-level page tables
>   - Inverted page tables
>   - Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) for caching translations
> 
> **3. Page Table Base Register:**
> - CPU has a register pointing to the current process's page table
> - Updated during context switches
> 
> **4. Shared Pages:**
> - Multiple processes can share read-only pages (e.g., code segments)
> - Implemented by mapping different virtual pages to the same physical frame
> 
> **5. Page Faults:**
> - What if a page isn't in memory?
> - Page fault handler loads the required page from disk
> - Enables virtual memory larger than physical memory
> 
> **6. Protection:**
> - Page table entries often include permission bits (read/write/execute)
> - Enables fine-grained memory protection
> 
> **7. Speed**
> - We need double the number of memory references per instruction,
> 
> These considerations highlight the complexity and flexibility of paging systems in modern operating systems.
