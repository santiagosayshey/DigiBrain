motivation - we want to eliminate external fragmentation. we do this by eliminating the requirement that address space is contiguous
 we want to grow segments as needed. 

idea - pages
- divide virtual address spaces into fixed size pages and physical memory into frames
	- Define a size for these pages, eg 2^n: 4KiB

include and explain image. Instead of storing process memory in contiguous memory, we assign blocks within these processes to pages. These pages can be placed anywhere in the memory, they don't have to be next to each other.
