> [!motivation] Eliminating External Fragmentation
> In memory management, external fragmentation occurs when there is **enough total memory** to satisfy an allocation request, but the **available memory is not contiguous**. This leads to inefficient memory utilization and can prevent processes from being loaded into memory even when sufficient total memory exists.

> To address this issue, we need a memory management technique that:
> - **Eliminates the requirement for contiguous memory allocation**
> - Allows segments to grow as needed without relying on adjacent free memory

> [!idea] Paging
> Paging is a memory management scheme that **divides the virtual address space into fixed-size units called pages and the physical memory into frames of the same size.**
> - Virtual address space is divided into pages of a fixed size, typically a power of 2 (e.g., 4KiB)
> - Physical memory is divided into frames of the same size as the pages
> - Instead of allocating contiguous memory to processes, individual pages are assigned to frames in physical memory
> - Pages belonging to a process do not need to be stored in adjacent frames, allowing for flexibility in memory allocation

> [!idea] Benefits and Implications of Paging
> - **Elimination of External Fragmentation**: By allowing pages to be allocated to non-contiguous frames, paging effectively eliminates external fragmentation. The physical memory can be utilized more efficiently, as small gaps between allocated memory no longer hinder the allocation of new processes.
> 
> - **Flexibility in Memory Allocation**: Paging enables processes to grow or shrink their memory usage by allocating or deallocating individual pages. This flexibility allows for more efficient memory utilization and accommodates the dynamic memory requirements of processes.
> 
> - **Page Tables**: To keep track of the mapping between virtual pages and physical frames, a data structure called a page table is used. Each process has its own page table, which contains entries that map virtual page numbers to physical frame numbers. The page table is consulted during memory accesses to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses.

consider - translation virtual to physical
- A new problem arises. If we don't store connected memory in contiguous physical memory, how do we know where to find the next piece of memory?
	- answer: translation

idea - translation of page addresses
- We take the high order bits of the address to find the page number
- we take the low order bits of the address to find the offset within a page
- we translate the page number into a frame number, and append the offset!


example - translation in a 32 bit system
