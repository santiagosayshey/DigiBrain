>[!idea]+ **Introduction to HTML**
>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It consists of elements defined by tags, which browsers interpret to display web pages. Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document, including tags, elements, and attributes, is crucial for web development.

>[!exercise] **HTML Structure Exercise**
>Create a basic HTML document with the following elements: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. Inside the body, include a paragraph (`<p>`) that says "Hello, World!" and make it bold using `<b>`.

**Key HTML Concepts**

| Concept           | Description                                                                                      | Example                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Tags & Elements   | Tags define the start and end of an element. Elements are the building blocks of an HTML page.  | `<p>Hello World!</p>`     |
| Attributes        | Provide additional information about elements.                                                  | `<img src="image.jpg">`   |
| Nesting           | Elements can be placed inside other elements.                                                    | `<div><p>Nested</p></div>`|
| Empty Elements    | Some elements do not have closing tags and are self-closing.                                    | `<img src="image.jpg">`   |

>[!idea]+ **Text Formatting and Structure**
>HTML provides a variety of tags for formatting text, including headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), bold (`<b>`), italics (`<i>`), and special characters. Proper use of these elements enhances the readability and accessibility of web content.

>[!idea]+ **Organizing Content with Lists and Tables**
>Lists (ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>`) and tables (`<table>`) are essential for organizing information in a structured, easy-to-read manner. Use lists to group related items and tables to display data in rows and columns.

>[!exercise] **List and Table Exercise**
>Create an HTML document that includes an unordered list of your three favorite websites with links (`<a>`) and a simple table comparing their main features.

>[!idea]+ **Links and Images**
>Links (`<a href="URL">`) connect documents together, allowing users to navigate from one page to another or to external sites. Images (`<img src="URL">`) enrich the content by providing visual context.

>[!exercise] **Linking and Embedding Exercise**
>Embed an image related to HTML coding and create a link to a tutorial on HTML basics. Use the `<img>` tag for the image and the `<a>` tag for the link.

>[!idea]+ **Forms for Interaction**
>Forms (`<form>`) collect user input through various types of fields (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`), enabling interactive experiences and data collection on websites.

**HTML Forms and Inputs**

| Element    | Description                                        | Example                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `<form>`   | Contains interactive controls for submitting data. | `<form action="/submit">...</form>`  |
| `<input>`  | Allows the user to input data.                     | `<input type="text" name="name">`    |
| `<select>` | Provides a drop-down list.                         | `<select><option>Option</option></select>` |
| `<textarea>`| Allows multiline text input.                       | `<textarea name="message"></textarea>`|

>[!exercise] **Form Creation Exercise**
>Design a simple feedback form that includes fields for the user's name, email, and a message. Use `<input>` for name and email, and `<textarea>` for the message.
