## Recap: Website Login & Security
- Can be difficult to implement well
	- Very easy to make security mistakes
- Risk of compromise
	- If compromised users may abandon your service... or worse
- The 1st rule of security programming is:
	- **Don't implement your own security**
	- But if you have to, follow best practices

## Basics

### 1. Encrypt all Communications
- Use HTTPS for all communications involving senstive information
	- Unencrypted HTTP traffic can be 'sniffed' on insecure networks, or read by third parties
	- HTTPS uses end to end encryption to ensure **confidentiality** betwen the client and server
	- This is especially important for any sites that have any form of login
		- Not doing so exposes password and / or session tokens
	- Users accessing your website via HTTP should be redirected to the secture, HTTPS version of the site
		- Do this for all requests, or use a HTTPS proxy

  ### 2. Use Security Zones
  - Split your site and routes into seperate zones that e sure only authorised users may access that content
	  - Use middleware to enforce user permissions across an entire zone;
		  - Avoid manually coding this check into every route. You are more likely to make mistakes when doing so
	  - This also allows better enforcing of **authentication, confidentiality** and allows us to **audit / log** differently for different zones

### 3. Validate All Inputs and Outputs
- Do not directly store use input without first checking to ensure it does not contain malicious content
	- Do not store objects sent from client side directly
	- Use prepared statements to sanitise input data that will be used in database queries
	- express-validator has serveral functions for validating and escaping user input
	- When modifying webpage contents, use `innertext` instead of `innerHTML` wherever possible

## Handling User Authentication

### 4. Get Someone Else to Do it
- Use OpenID where possible

### 5. Don't restrict passwords
- Some web programmers restrict character types and lengths to make sanitisation easier
	- That's lazy
	- Don't be lazy
	- Allow all characters
- Set long password max lengths
	- OWASP reccomends 160 characters as a good length

### 6. Don't store passwords in plain text
- Use a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm
	- Argon2
	- PBKDF2
	- scrypt
	- bcrypt
- Don't use known compromised algorithms
	- MD5
	- SHA-1

#### Cryptographic Hasing
- A cryptographic hash function is a hash function whick takes an input (or message) and returns a fixed size alphanumeric string
- The ideal hash function has three main properties
	1. It is extremely easy to calculate a hash for any given data -> **reduces load**
	2. It is extremely computationally difficult to calculate an alphanumeric text that has a given has -> **near impossible to reverse**
	3. It is extremely unlikely that two slightly different messages will have the same has -> **Near impossible to guess**

### 7. Salt Your Hashes

- Many hashing algorithms have been dumped into reverse-lookup tables known as rainbow tables, so a hash by itself is not secure
- Salt your hashes
	- Use additional unique information when hashing a password
	- Store the unique information with the hash
- Now, if someone does find a match for the has, it's not the original password
- Be sure your salt i:
	- Fixed length
	- Cryptographically generated
	- Random
	- Different for each stored hash

### 8. Assume Security Will Be Compromised
- Don't expect your cureent password system to protect your users forever
	- Keep your system up to date
	- Enforce good security practice on your users
	- Implement 2FA
	- Plan for how you will handle a data breach
