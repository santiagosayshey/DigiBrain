## Security Fundamentals
- Web apps are everywhere and widely accessible
- This makes them an easier target for attack by malicious users
- Poor security practices can result in a compromise of your service, resulting in potential financial loss, abandoned users or legal action

## Terminology
- Vulnerability
	- A Weakness or flaw in software, hardware or processes that could lead to a security breach
- Threat
	- A circumstance which could lead to unauthorised access or damage to data
	- A **Threat Agent** is the person / group running the attack
- Risk
	- The probability of a threat occuring and the degree of impact of such an event
	- Usually expressed as low, medium or high
- Mitigation
	- Action taken to reduce the risk of a threat

## Elements of a Secure System
- Authentication
	- Ability to identify a user
- Authorisation
	- Ability to limit what a user can or can't do
- Auditing
	- Tracking of actions by users, can identify who made a request?
- Confidentiality
	- Ability to control what information can be accessed
- Integrity
	- Ability to control what information is changed
- Availability
	- Ability to provide the web application service

- If our system does not have all of these, then our system is vulnerable

## Steps for Checking Security
1. Identify Vulnerabilities
2. Identify threats for any vulnerabilties
		a. Determine how many vulnerabilities may be exploited
3. Identify level of risk
		a. Use a risk matix to determine the level of risk associated with each threat
4. Take action
