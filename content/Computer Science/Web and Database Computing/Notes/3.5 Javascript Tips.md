# Null
- Usually happens when trying to select elements that don't exist
- Can be mitigated using `if` check or `try - catch` block


# Automatic Type Conversions
- == vs ===

- Javascript does automatic type conversions
- Comparing two equivalent values will yield a `true` result
- Can result in unexpected behaviour
	- A common example is checking if something is `0`
	- If a `null` value is passed instead, it will still evaluate `true`

```js
if (x == 0) { ... }
```

- Mitigate using === instead of ==
	- This will compare value AND type

```js
if (x === 0) { ... }
```

- If in doubt, use ===
- TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language that includes types


# Variable Scope & Closures
- When in doubt, USE `Let`
