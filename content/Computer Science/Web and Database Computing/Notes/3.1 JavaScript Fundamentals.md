# Dynamic Web Pages

- We can make our pages more useful by changing content as needed for the user
- There are lots of reasons why we might want a web page to be dynamic
	- Different content depending on country of client (different language)
	- Different content depending on browser, operating system, etc
	- Shopping Carts
	- Customised infomration
	- Respond to events
		- Mouse overs
		- Clicks

## How Do We Make Dynamic Web Pages?

- Server side
	- Generate custom web page on a web server ( in response to client actions ) and send to client
- Client Side
	- Execute code in client's browser

## Client Side

- Complex websites can put heavy load on the webserver providing them
	- Client side code execution can reduce this load by moving it to the client
	- Clients have become much more powerful and are able to handle more complex tasks
- Client side code can also reduce page loading times
	- Allow our pages to do interesting things without loading a new one
	- Some tasks can be done without needing to communicate with the server
- Better User Experience
	- Improved responsiveness for the end user
	- We will look at this more when cover AJAX

# JavaScript

- Is Dynamic
	- Code is interpreted as it is executed
- Weakly Typed
	- Types are associated with individual objects
	- Can store ANY type in ANY variable / const
	- Can pass ANY variable to ANY function ( that accepts parameters )
- Object Oriented
- Event Driven
	- Concurrency can result in unexpected behaviour

- Example
```run-js
/* Diplays an alert showing whether it's Monday or not*/

function isItMonday() {
	const MONDAY=1;
	var now = new Date();

	if (now.getDay() == MONDAY) {
		console.log("It's Monday!");
	} else {
		console.log("It's not Monday");
	}
}

isItMonday();
```

## Syntax

- C Style Syntax
	- Lines end in `;`
	- Code blocks enclosed in `{ }`
	- Comments
		- Single Line `// ...`
		- Multiple Line `/* ... */`
	- Variables
		- No types, anything can be passed anywhere
		- Scope depends on declaration
		- Undeclared variables scoped at `global` level - can be accessed by ANY part of the code
		- Declared variables using `var` scoped at `function` level - can be accessed by the current function
		- Delcared variables using `let` scoped at block level - can be acceseed by the current individual for loop / if statement
	- Constants
		- Declared using `const`, scoped at `function` level

## Basic Control Structures

- `If` / `Else`

```javascript
if (condition) {
	// do something
} else if (condition) {
	// do something else
} else {
	// otherwise, do this
}
```

- `For` loop

```javascript
for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {
	// do something
}
```

- `While` loop

```javascript
while (condition) {
	// do something
}
```


## Functions

- Basic Function Definition

```javascript
function addFunction(param1, param2) {
	var value = param1 + param2;
	return value;
}
```

- Anonymous Function Definition

```javascript
var addFunction = function(param1, param2) {
	var value = param1 + param2;
	return value;
}
```

- ES6 Arrow Function Definition

```javascript
var addFunction = (param1, param2) => {
	var value = param1 + param2;
	return value;
}
```


# Running Our Code

## Inline JS

- We use the `script` tag to run javascript code in our webpages
- Scripts can be inline with the page content

```html
<script>
	// Some javascript
</script>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Is it Tuesday?</h1>
    <script>
        function isItTuesday() {
          const TUESDAY = 2;
            var now = new Date();
          if (now.getDay() == TUESDAY) {
            alert("It's Tuesday!")
          } else {
            alert("It's not Tuesday!")
          }
        }
        isItTuesday();
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

## External JS

- Scripts can also be loaded from external files
	- Like CSS files
- It's important to load scripts in the correct sections of our HTML code

```html
<script src="file.js"> 

</script>
```

`index.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Is it Tuesday?</h1>
    <script src="monday.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

`monday.js`
```javascript
function isItTuesday() {
  const TUESDAY = 2;
  var now = new Date();
    
  if (now.getDay() == TUESDAY) {
    alert("It's Tuesday!")
  } else {
    alert("It's not Tuesday!")
  }
}

isItTuesday();
```

## Event Attributes

- Code can be run using event attribuites

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">
	Let's Find Out
</button>
```

- Or event attributes can be used to call parts of our scripts

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Document</title>
  <script src="monday.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Is it Tuesday?</h1>
    <button onclick="isItTuesday()" type="button">
      Let's Find Out!
    </button>
</body>

</html>
```
