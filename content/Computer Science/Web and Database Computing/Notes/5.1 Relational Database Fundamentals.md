- Information used in web applications are stored in databases

## How to Store Web Application Data
- Store on client using cookies
	- Designed for a website to remember stateful information by storing user information in the user's web browser
		- Items added in a shopping cart
	- Authentication cookies to know whether a user is logged in or not
		- Data expires when the browser is closed
	- Data is stored on client, so not control
- Store on the server using variables or sessions
	- Allow user information to be stored on the server instead of the client
	- Data is not persistent. The information is lost when the server is restarted
- What about information that needs to persist between restarts of the server?

### Information in Files
- We will need to write code to
	- Check data integrity
		- Make sure all the values are valid
	- Handle all the ways to access the data
		- Return different parts of the data as needed
	- Manage concurrent access
		- What if a second functions reads the data before the first has written an update
	- Ensure that repeated data in multiple files is updated everywhere when changed
	- Control access to the data through permissions


## Database Management Systems
- Databases are applications that are optimised for storing and accessing data efficiently
- Several database models exist:
	- Flat file
	- Network
	- Object Oriented
	- Document Store
	- Graph
	- And more...
- The most common model is by far the relational model (Codd 1970)
	- Underpinned by a mathematical model (relational algebra)
	- Most common implementations include **Oracle, MySQL / MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server**

### Relational Databases
- Consider a store:
	- The store wants to keep a record of all their customers and the times they've purchased during each shopping trip
	- How do we store that data?

#### Keep the Data in One Big Spreadsheet
- Save it in a single file, or store the rows as an array of objects

- This has issues
	- Data is duplicated
	- What if want to change things? We would have to change the same thing multiple times

#### Split into Multiple Spreadsheets

- Scaling Up, this becomes incredibly efficient

### Relational Databases Cont.

- They seperate data into entities; 2 dimensional tables that consist of:
	- Attributes ( column headers )
	- Tuples ( rows )

- Where each tuple is unique
- Logical connections between the entities define relationships between them
- This blueprint for a relational database is called the **Database Schema**
