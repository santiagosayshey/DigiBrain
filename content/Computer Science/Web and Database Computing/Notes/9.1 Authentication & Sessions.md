## Server Sessions and Session Tokens
- Recall from previous lecture that cookies can be used to uniquely identify clients, avoiding the need to send login data with each request
	- The sessions software sets a cookie at the client browser with unique session id, known as a session token
	- Whenever the browser sends requests to this website, it includes this data
	- The server uses the unique session id to associate that client with the data that it stores
	- When the session token expires or the server shuts down the session data is lost
- Therefore, if a user has already been authenticated by our web application, and we know their session ID, then ANY  request from that session may also be considered authenticated for the duration of that session

## Basic Login Workflow
- User visits website, is given a session token
- User logs in
	- If login sucessful, record the user's detaials against their session
- For all futrure requests, check if the request's session has a user attached to it
	- If a user is present, we know that they've already logged in, and call allow them to proceed
- To log a user out, simply remove their details from that session

## AJAX Site Authentication Workflow
1. Client sends AJAX request for resource
2. Authenticate & Authorise Request
	1. Does the user have a valid session? 
	2. Is the user allowed to access the resource? 
3. If okay, send 200 with requested resource (DONE) 
	~ OR ~ 
4. If NOT okay, send a 401/403 
	1. Client displays login dialog or redirects to login page 
5. Client sends credentials 
6. If okay, create session and link to user 
	1. Client may re-send original AJAX request

### Tips
- Initialise sessions by default
- Use middleware
	- Seperate routes into public / freely accessible vs user  / private data
	- Add middleware to authenticate and authorise all requests to the user routes
- Perform all redirects on client (because AJAX)


## Website Login & Security Challenges
- Can be difficult to implement well
	- Very easy to make security mistakes
- Risk of compromise
	- If compromised, users may abandon your service
- Users commonly have poor security practices
	-  Users often use the same password multiple places
- Users don't like having to create new accounts for every site they visit

 **The 1st Rule of Security Programming is to get someone better to do it for you**

### OpenID Connect
- Authentication based on OAuth 2.0
- User clicks OpenID button for their Identity provider
- User logs in to identify Provider's website
- Identity provider verifies user information and provides verification to our web application
- Our web application matches identity info to user's account

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230430204051.png]]

- OpenID relies on the client sending our server a token from the identity provider
- How do we verify the legitmacy of the token?
	- The token is encrypted using public key cryptography
		- Encryption is done using the provider's private key
		- We can decrypt the token the provider's public key
		- Descryption will only work if the provider performed the encryption (token unmodified)
	- If the token is verified, then the user data inside is legitimate and we can authenticate the user


### Alternate Approach - OAuth With Authorisation Code

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230430203403.png]]

- This approach relies on the browser's ability to redirect to an alternate page on our site
- By including a code in the URL that the browser is directed to, our server consequently recieves the code
	- The code is unique, single use, limited duration and restricted to only work if send in a request from our server
		- Our server can then make a seperate request to the login provider, using the code to get the user's details
		- Additional scopes and access to other services from that provider can also be done this way

### Post LogIn
- Use the identity information provided to match user's info to their user account on the web app
- If they don't have an account generate one
- Perform standard login actions such as grant session token access
