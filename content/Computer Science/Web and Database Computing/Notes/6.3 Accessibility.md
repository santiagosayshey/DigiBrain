## Guidelines

### Perceivable
- Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can percieve

- Sign language or audio-only videos

#### Adaptable Content
- Provide options for presenting content in different ways that may be easier for someone to use
- Give users a choice of font size or a simplified layout
- Add metadata so that it can be used by assistive softrware or converted to other formats by the user

#### Distinguishable
- Ensure text is clear, a reasonable size, has good contrast and is well spaced
- Ensure colours have a good contrast and are accessible to color blind people
- Avoid pop-up and hover items, these can be difficult to work with

### Operable
- User interface components and navigation must be operable

#### Keyboard Accessible
- Make all functionality avaiable from a keyboard
- Use standard form controls ( accessible by default ), or use the tabindex attrivute

#### Enough Time
- Provide users enough time to read and use content
- Avoid timed interactions where possible to giver users as much time as needed

#### Seizures and Physical Reactions
- Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions
- Avoid high contrast flashing content

#### Navigable
- Provide ways to help users navigate, find content and determine where they are
- Use consistent and accessible menus and breadcrumbs

#### Input Modalities
- Make it easier for users to operation functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard
- Allow for / expect a variety of pointer / touch based input methods
- Fitt's Law

- Validate your HTML!
- Use metadata and semantic HTML

## Design

### Colours
- Poor colour choice can be off putting at best, unusable at worst
- People with colour blindness may not be able to differentiate between normally different colours
- Aim for a contrast ratio of 4.5 : 1 for small text, or 3 : 1 for large text ( greater than 24pt )
- Use a color checker to help

### Fonts
- Some fonts are optimised for on screen display vs print
- Sans Serif fonts are generally more easily read on screens
- Avoid blinking or moving text
