## Semantic HTML
- Tags and attributes can also convery meaning in addition to functionality
- Useful for:
	- Screen reader and other accessibility software
	- Search engines
	- Browser features (printing, reader mode, etc)
- Example `<b> vs <strong>`
	- The `<b>` tag makes text bold
	-  The `<strong>` tag makes text bold **because the text is important**
- Accessibility sofrwares uses this information to better convey meaning
- Search engines use it to understand a page's content

### Semantic Tags
- Use these instead of generic elements like `<div> and <span>`

```html
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
<label>
```

### HTML `<meta>` Tag
- Used to convery additional info about the webapge that is not part of the content
	- Used for data like page description, keywords, author, last modified
	- This metadata can be used by browsers, search engines, accessibility software or other web services

```html
<!-- Define keywords for search engines -->
<meta name="keywords" content="Accesibility and Semantic Elements">

<!-- Define a description of your web page -->
<meta name="description" content="Your last WDC lecture before break">

<!-- Define the author of a page -->
<meta name="author" content="Ian Knight">
```

### Semantic Attributes
- Semantic attributse can provide meaning to elements
	- The `alt` attribute on an image provides a text description of the image
	- The `for` attribute on labels
	- `title` and `name` attributes
	- Use **ARIA** attributes

#### ARIA
- Dynamically updated web content presents challenges for accessibility
	- New controls and components don't nessecarily have dedicated tags
		- Widgets such as progress bars are built using generic elements
	- Screen reader and accessibility software may not be informed of content updates, or may nor know which updates are relevant
- ARIA is a standard that allows us to provide additional semantic data to our dynamic page elements for better accessibility
	- Accessiblity software can better react to page changes

## CSS Frameworks
- Building a website from the ground up is hard
	- We can use templates, but they don't often fit our website without looking like ... templates

- CSS Frameworks provide a consisten style set that we can customise while still building our design from scratch
	- They can be added with a script or link tag

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheets/bootstrap.min.css">
```

- They provide a solid base for building the rest of your site
- They usually provide a grid mechanism for alligning elements on your page
