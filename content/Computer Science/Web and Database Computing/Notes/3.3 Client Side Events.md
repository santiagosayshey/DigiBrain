# Javascript Browser Events

## What are Events?

- Web programming is commonly `event driven`
- Rather than all your code running at once, when the page loads, some parts of your code can be triggered by external inputs:
	- General user input
		- Mouse clicks, keyboard presses
	- A user interacting with specific elements on the page
		- Forms
	- Page elements loading or failing to load
	- Network requests finishing
	- Arbitrary events that you define
  - This means we often to pre-define code that will run at a later time

## Basic Events
- In the browser, there are many types of events:
	- `load` onload attribute
		- For `body`, `img` and other select tags, fires when that element and all children finish loading
	- `change` (onchange) 
		- Fires when the value of an input is changed
	- `click` (onclick attribute)
		- Fires when an element is clicked
	- `mousedown` and `mouseup`
		- Fire when the mouse button is pressed down and then when released respectively
	- `mouseover` / `mouseenter` and `mouseout` / `mouseleave`
		- Fire when the mouse cursor enters or leaves an element respectively
	- `keydown` and `keyup` Fire when a key is pressed / released

## Using Events
- Events cvan be used to trigger out code by attaching out code to an event attribute
	- In the HTML
	- Or in Javascript

```html
<button id="aButton" onmouseout="myFunction()">
	Triggers when the mouse leaves
</button>
```

```js
document.getElementById("aButton").onmouseout = myfunction;
```

## Multiple Event Handlers using Listeners

- The previous examples only allowed 1 function to run when an event occurs, but what if we want to dynamically add or remove several
- Use an `EventListener`

```js
var myButton = document.getElementById("aButton");
myButton.addEventListener('mouseout', myFunction)
```

- Where `myFunction` is the function we want triggered

<hr />

- We can add multiple listeners to the same element and event, and the same handler function to mulitple listeners

```js
var myButton = document.getElementById("aButton");

myButton.addEventListener('mouseenter', myFunction1);  
myButton.removeEventListener('mouseenter', myFunction1);

myButton.addEventListener('mouseenter', myFunction1);  
myButton.removeEventListener('mouseenter', myFunction1)
```
