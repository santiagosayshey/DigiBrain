## Managing State

### State in a Stateless Protocol
- Recall that HTPP is **stateless**
	- Each requests is unrelated to any previous requests
	- The server doesn't retain information about individual requests
- But **sometimes we need state**, how can we address this problem?
	- On the server side, we can store state in databases, but how do we connect this new data to new requests?
		- e.g. If a user has a shopping cart and we want to show them the contents that was in their cart when they last visited our page
	- What if we want to store short term information (only since the user logged in) that we dont wont to store long term in the database
		- e.g. Pages visited since logging in?
	- We could make users login to identify themselves?
		- But then we cant have anaymous shopping or browsing
		- Login data would need to be sent with **every request**

### Cookies
- A HTTP cookie is a small pieice of data send from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing
- The browser sends the cooke in the head of each new HTTP request to that website
- Cookies were created to allow the server to store state on the client
	- Widely used
	- Stored on client side
	- Can be viewed and modified both client and server side
	- Can be used to store small pieces of data (up to 4096 bytes) that need to be send to the server with each request
	- Can be used to uniquely identify different clients, avoiding need to log in with each request
	- Can be set to expire at a specific date / time (persistent)
		- If no expiry provided, will be cleared by the browser when closed (sessional / transient)

#### Cookies in Express
- Express generator provides the cookie parser middleware to automatically handle cookies

##### Sending a cookie to the client:

```js
res.cookie('cookie_name', 'cookie_value');
```

- Do this before your `res.send` or `res.json`
- Results in this cookie on the client:
- Will be present in subsequent requests to the server

##### Accessing a Cookie sent by the cleint:

```js
req.cookies.cookie_name;
```

- We can set additional options with the objects obect

```js
res.cookie('cookie_name', { domain: '.example.com', path: '/admin', secure: true });
```

- Additional objects include:
	- `expires`
		- Expiry date of the cookie in GMT. If not specified or set to 0, creates a session cookie
	- `maxAge`
		- Convenient optionf for setting the expiry time relative to the current time in milliseconds
	- `path`
		- Path for the cookie. Defaults to `"/"`
	- `secure`
		- If true, the cookie may only be used with HTTP


## State on the Server

### Server Sessions
- Assume a user has logged in. How do we track information about the user since logging in?
	- We could just store all the data we want to keep as cookies which expire when the browser is closed, but
	- All of this information is visible to the user, they can look at their cookies
	- All of this information has to bne sent to the server with every request
- This approach can expose infomration about the internal workings of your web application (product id numbers, user id numbers, etc) which can be a security risk
	- If i edit the cookie and change the user id, can I get someone else's info?
- Server sessions allows this temporary user information to be stored at the server instead of the client

### Server Tokens
- Cookies can be used to uniquely indentify clients, avoiding the need to send login data with each request
	- The sessions software sets a cookie at the client browser with a cryptographically unique session ID, known as a session token
	- Whenever the browser esends requests to this website, it includes this session token
	- The server uses the unique sessions id to associate that client with the data it stores
		- We can store as much data as we like against the session
		- This data is stored server-side (secure)
	- Wehn the session token expires or the server shuts down, the session data is lost


### Server Sessions in Express
- Need to setup the express-session middleware in `app.js` (not included by default)

```js
...
var session = require('express-session');    // THIS CODE //

var app = express();

app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());

app.use(session({                            //           //
 secret: ‘a string of your choice’,          //           //
 resave: false,                              // THIS CODE //
 saveUninitialized: true,                    //           //
 cookie: { secure: false }                   //           //
}));                                         //           //

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);

module.exports = app;
```

- The session middleware will automatically handle most of this for us
	- Creates the session and issues session token to the client
	- Stores session data on the server and maps it to the Session Token for incoming requests
	- Makes this stored data avaiable for each requests using `req.session` variable
- You can set and read session variables using `req.session` in your routes in `index.js`

```js
req.session.variableName = 5; 
console.log(req.session.variableName);
```

- It is also possible to store your sessions in your database to make them survive the server shutting down

## Cookies vs Server Sessions

### Duration
- Both will be kept according to the expiry date on the cookie / session token
- If no expiry date is present, these will usually be lost when the browser closes

### Storage Capacity
- Cookies can be as large as 4KB
- A session token itself just a small cookie, since the data is stored on the server, there is no limit on the amount of data that can be stored against a server session

### Security
- Cookie data is stored on the client side and can be fully accessed / modified by the client
- While the session token itself is stored on the client, its contents is useless to the client
- The session data itself is stored on the server and next exposed to the client
- A session token ID is crytographically generated so it is effectively impossible to forge
