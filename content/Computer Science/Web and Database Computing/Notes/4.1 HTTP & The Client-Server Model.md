# What are Clients and Servers?

- The Client / Server Model is a dsitributed application structure that partitions taks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients
	- Clients access services and resources 
		- Web browsers are the clients in a system
	- Servers provide those services and resources

## How does this work?

1. The client establishes a TCP connection to the server
2. The client makes a request to the server
3. The server sends a response to the client
4. The client may make additional requests
5. The connection is closed

### URLs

- Uniform Resource Locator - an address that identifies a resource ( Web Page ) on the Internet

```
http.//www.adelaide.edu.au:80/students
```

#### Protocol `http`
- Application layer protocol used in network
- HTTP ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol )
- HTTPS ( SSL-encrypted communication HTTP )

#### Domain Name or Host Name `www.adelaide.edu.au`
- An identifier for Server / Host of the web application
- if not already known to the cleint, must be resolved by the DNS to an IP address ( Network Layer )
	- 192.168.1.1

#### Port `:80`

- An identifier of the particular process running on the server ( Transport Layer )
- 65535 ports availabel, with 0 - 1023 reserved
- Default HTTP port is 80
- Default HTTPS port is 443

#### Path `/students`

- Path to web page in the server
- Default path usually index.html if not given

### Establishing A Connection
- The client first needs to establish a TCP connection to the server
- From the URL, the client has the domain name and port number
	- The client first resolved the Domain using the DNS
	- Once the client knows the IP address of the server, it can send data to that host, requesting the service on the given port
	- The server replies, ACKnowledging the reciept of the data
	- The client sends a final ACKnowledgement of its own
- Once connected, the client is ready to send a HTTP request
## HTTP Messages

- Messages exhchanged between a server and client
- Automatically generated by a web browser or web server
- HTTP Request:
	- Send by a client to trigger an action on the server
- HTTP Response:
	- An answer to the client sent by the server
- Structure
	- Start Line:
		- The requests to be implemented or the response status
		- `REQUEST`
			1. Type of Request
				- `GET`: Get a resource (web page, image, etc)
				- `POST`: Accept information related to a resource (  usually form data )
				- `HEAD`: Get information about the resource but not the resource itself
				- `PUT`: Store this resource on the server
				- `DELETE`: Delete a resource
			  2. Path of Resource
				  - From URL
			  3. Protocol Version of HTTP being used
				  - Usually `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2.0`
		  - `RESPONSE`
			  1. Protocol Version of HTTP being used
				  - Usually `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2.0`
			  2. Status code indiciating if the request was able to be fulfilled
				  - `1xx` Information (100 continue)
				  - `2xx` Sucess (200 OK)
				  - `3xx` Instructions to client (301/302 to redirect, 304 to use cached version)
				  - `4xx` Client Error (401 Unauthorised, 4-4 Not Found)
				  - `5xx` Server Error (500 internet serval error)
	- Headers:
		- Meta data information about the resource and client / sever
		- Example Request Headers:
			- Accept: text/plain
			- If-Modified-Since: Sat, 28 Aug 2010 19:45:22 GMT
			- User-Agent e.g:
				- Host: `giphy.com`
				- Referer: `https://google.com`
				- User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0...
		- Example response headers
			- Content-Type: text/html; charset=ut-8
			- Date: Sat, 28 Aug 2010 19:45:22 GMT
			- Last-Modified: Sat, 28 Aug 2010 19:45:22 GMT
	- Body:
		- Data associated with the response or request

# Sending a Request

## Telnet (HTTP)

```bash
telnet mirror.aarnet.edu.au 80              // try to connect

## OpenSSL (HTTPS)
- Same process at telnet, just a different command at the start


## Insomnia
- An easier way to send requests
