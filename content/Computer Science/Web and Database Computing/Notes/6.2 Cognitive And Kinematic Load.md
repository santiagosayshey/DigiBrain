## Easy UI Is Good UI

### Performance Loads
- "Good Design doesn't get in the way"
- The usability of an interface can be simplified to two general principles
- Cognitive Load
	- How much thought does a task require?
- Kinematic Load
	- How much effort does a task require?
- Together, these are commonly also known as performance load

#### Cognitive Load
- Consider this door:

- Cognitive load describes the amount of thought / mental work required to complete a given task
- The lower the load, the less a user needs to think about how ot use our system
	- The more they can enjoy it
- Systems should be intuitive for end users
	- Aim to remove the need for instructions

##### Minimising Cognitive Load
- Affordance
	- Make the actions that users want to take, easily accessible and readily percievable
	- Use icons and symbols that clearly reflect the meaning of what they are used for
- Consistency
	- Use a consisteny style and layouy
	- Both in relation to other parts of your site and other sites too
- "Don't make me think!"
	- Simplicity
		- Avoid clutter
	- Choice of words
		- Use words that match the user's goals
		- Use common language; avoid jargon

#### Kinematic Load
- Describes the amount of physical work required to complete a given task
- The lower the load, the less a user needs to do to use our system
	- The more they can enjoy it
- Systems should require as little physical effort to use as possible
	- Aim to remove excessive / extraneous actions

##### Minimising Kinematic Load
- Proximity
	- Related objects should be close to each other
	- Positioning objects that are likely to be used together far away from each other creates extra effort to interact with them
- Layers
	- Avoid hiding controls mulitple layers / menus / dialogues / pages deep
	- Keep frequently used controls always available
- **Fitt's Law**
	- Model of human movement primarily used in human-computer interaction and ergonomics
	- Provides a way to quantify kinematic load
	- The amount of time / ease for a person to touch a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target ( in the direction of travel )
		- Larger controls are easier to interact with
		- Closer controls are easier to interact with
		- Controls close to screen edges are easier to interact with
