## Joining Tables
- Joins combines tables, usually on a common column

### Inner Join
- The most common type of join is an **inner join** which only returns tows with matching values in a given column

```sql
SELECT * FROM tableA INNER JOIN tableB
	ON tableA.column1 = tableB.column2;
```

- The `ON` Clause is used to specify which columns should be matched
	- I.e. Any rows from `tableA` and `tableB` whose `column1` and `column2` values match will be combined into a single row in the result

### Cartesian Join
- While an inner join may be the most common type of join that we use, there are other types of joins
	- A cartesian join is the simplest type of join

```sql
SELECT * FROM tableA, tableB;
```

- Each row is combined with each column
- This is VERY inefficient; **avoid unless absolutely nessecary**

### Left Outer Join
- Joins two tables by keeping the rows all of the rows of the fist table

```sql
SELECT * FROM tableA LEFT JOIN tableB
	ON tableA.column1 = tableB.column2;
```

- The `ON` clause is used to specify which columns should be matched
	- Rows from the first table that aren't matched will be padded out with `NULL / DEFAULT` values

### Right Outer Join
- Same as a left outer join but for table 2
- Not usually supported (as you can just switch the order of the tables)

```sql
SELECT * FROM tableA RIGHT JOLIN tableB
	ON tableA.column1 = tableB.column2;
```

### Full Outer Join
- Keeps all rows of both tables

```sql
SELECT * FROM tableA FULL join tableB
	ON tableA.column1 = tableB.column2;
```

- The `ON` clause is used to specify which columns should be matched
	- Rows from either table that aren't matched will be padded out with `NULL / DEFAULT` values

### Natural Join
- A **Natural Join** is the same as an inner join, however the columns used to join are chosen automatically

```sql
SELECT * FROM tableA NATURAL JOIN tableB;
```

- The column chosen will be one that has the exact same name and data types on both tables

## Combining Rows
- Sometimes we may want to combine the results of multiple queries into a single set of rows

### Unions
- **Unions** append the results of one query to another
- Each `SELECT` statment within the Union must have the same number of fields in the result sets with matching data types
- The column name in the result will be the same of the column from the first table
- A standard union omits any duplicate rows
	- To retain duplicate rows, use `UNION ALL`

```sql
SELECT * FROM TableA
UNION
SELECT * FROM TableB;
```

### Intersections
- If we want only thr rows that are returned form both queries, we can use an **intersect**
	- Return only the matching results from two queries

```sql
SELECT * FROM TableA
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM TableB;
```

## Modiftying Column and Table Names

### Aliases
- Sometimes we may want to rename a column for outputting results, or make reading a query easier
- Use the `AS` keyword

```sql
SELECT column1 AS letters FROM TableA;
```

![[docs/Images/Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 2.56.34 pm.png]]

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM TableA AS A;
```

- This is useful for operations like joins:

```sql
SELECT A.column1, B.column2
FROM TableA AS A
INNER JOIN TableB AS B
ON A.column1 = B.column2
WHERE A.column1 = 'a';
```

## Ordering / Limiting Results

### Sorting Results using Order By
- A common desire is for the results of a query to be sorted on particular column. 
	- This can be achieved using `ORDER BY`

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
	ORDER BY Country;
```

- You can order Ascneding (A-Z) or Descending (Z-A)
- You can also specify secondary columns and tertiery columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
```

### Restricting Results
- While most of the queries and databases we've been working with only have a few entries, larger databases could return thousands or millions of results
	- Larger result sets can have performance and bandwidth consequences
	- We can limit the total number of results using `LIMIT`
	- If two numbers provided, the first is the offset into the result set

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
	LIMIT 50, 10; 
/* this will start from the 50th result and show the next 10 results */
```

- Use in conjunction with `ORDER BY` to ensure key results not ommited

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
	ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC
	LIMIT 100;
```

### Removing Duplicates
- Some queries may return dupliocate results, especially where a Primary key is not included or returned
	- Often we want to exclude duplicate results
	- We can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to only return unique results

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country From Customers;
```

- Can work with multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country, City FROM Customers;
```
