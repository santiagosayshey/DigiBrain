## Brute Force
- Straight forward approach, based on:
	- Problem Statement
	- Definitions of concepts involved
	- Raw power of computational engines
- Can almost always be improved, but will almost always work eventually
- Usually quadratic or exponential in complexity

### Examples
- Selection Sort

#### Exhaustive Search
- Certain problems have solution spaces that grow very quickly
- All exhaustive searches are brute force
- Unless we have a better algorithm for locating the best solution, we have to generate AND inspect each solution in turn (exhaustively) until we have looked at all of them and found which one was the best
- We have no way to stop before we've looked at all of them

##### Examples
- Trying all possible combinations of characters to work out a password

## Divide and Conquer
- Look at larger problem and break it up into smaller problems of roughly same size
- Solve these smaller problems recursively
- Combine these smaller solutions to get the larger solution

### Examples
- Merge sort

## Transform and Conquer
- We may choose to transform the problem to a form that is easier to solve
- There are three major versions:
	- Transform to a simpler or more convenient instance of the same problem
	- Change the representation
	- Transform to a different problem that we can solve

### Examples
#### Simplify
- Find unique elements, sort list

#### Change Representation
- Heap sort


## Dynamic Programming
- Break the problem down to smaller sub problems
- Solve each of them once
- Store the solutions into some data structure (usually a map)
- Using the stored values, find answers to larger sub problems

### Examples
- Fibonacci using ordered map

## Case Study: Maximum Sub Sequence Sum

### Method 1: Brute Force

```cpp
for(size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {  
	for (size_t j = i; j < s.size(); i++) {  
		int sum = 0;  
		for (size_t k = i; k <= j; k++) {  
			sum += s.at(k);  
		}  
		if (sum > max) {  
			max = sum;  
		}  
	}  
}  
return max;
```

- Check every element as first element
	- Check sum of first elements from current first to each of the following elements
- O(n^3)

### Method 2: Divide and Conquer

```cpp
int maxSubArray(vector<int> s, int start, int end) {  
	if (start == end) {  
		return s.at(0);  
}  

int mid = start + (end-start)/2;  
int leftMaxSum = maxSubArray(s, start, mid);  
int rightMaxSum = maxSubArray(s, mid + 1, end);  
int sum = 0; int leftMidMax = 0;  

for (int i = mid; i >=start; i--) {  
	sum+=s.at(i);  
	if (sum > leftMidMax) { leftMidMax = sum; }  
}  

sum = 0;  
int rightMidMax = 0;  

for (int i = mid + 1; i <=end; i++) { .... }  

int centerSum = leftMidMax + rightMidMax;  

return max(centerSum, max(leftMaxSum, rightMaxSum)); }
```

- Find the smallest sub-sequence in array to the left of the middle (inclusive) and to the right of the middle
- Return the largest of the left, right and left + right
- O(nlog(n))

### Method 3: Dynamic Programming (Kadane's Algorithm)

```cpp
int maxSubArray(vector<int> s) { 
	int sum = 0, maxSum = 0;  
	
	for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {  
		sum += s.at(i);  
		
		if (sum > maxSum) {  
			maxSum = sum;  
		}  
		else if (sum < 0) { sum = 0; }  
	}  
	
return maxSum;  
}
```

- Starting from each element in vector
	- Add sum, resetting to 0 whenever sum becomes negative
- O(n)
