## From Problem to Solution

### Understanding the Problem
- First, ask questions, clarify ambiguities
- What sub problems do you have in your problem?

### Determine Computing Resources
- Multiple processors vs single processor
	- Merge sort, is highly parallelisable
- Contiguous memory allocation is faster
- When using ADTs, much of this is hidden in the implementation details but will be implemented efficiently

### Consider Options For Problem
- What functions need to be supported?
- What type of data do we need to store?
- What containers will support these functions for the data?
- Case Study: Choosing a DS to store Trie node children
	- Need store and lookup pointer for a given child key
	- Do we need to store all possible children? Print in Order?
	- Vector? Array? Set? Map? Forward List?

### Analyse Chosen Option
- Set isn't suitable, the key and value are not the same
- Array - O(1) store / lookup has to store 26 child pointers (or nullptrs ) even if no possible child (eg words beginning with "zl")
- Vector - only O(1) indexing is by alphabet position otherwise O(n), so can't take advantage of dynamic growth
- Forward List - can reduce memory requirement, but then O(n) lookup of child pointer
- Unordered Map - O(n) worst case, O(1) average
