- The `friend` keyword can be used to designate one class as a friend of another class
- If class A is friends with class B, then class B can access private and protected members and methods of class A

## Style 1

```cpp
class Person {
	friend class PersonFriend;

	private:
		std::string dateOfBirth;
};

class PersonFriend {
	void wishHappyBirthday(Person& p) {
		if (p.date_of_birth == today.date)
			cout << "Happy Birthday!" << endl;
	}
};
```

## Style 2

```cpp
class Pet {
	friend class Owner;

	private:
		string dateOfBirth;
}

class Owner {
	Pet p;
	void wishHappyBirthday() {
		if (p.date_of_birth == today.date)
			cout << "Happy Birthday!" << endl;
	}
};
```

## Pros
- Can remove the need for getters and setters
- Shorter, more readble code and slight performance increase

## Cons
- Introduces coupling between classes
- Can make code difficult to maintain
