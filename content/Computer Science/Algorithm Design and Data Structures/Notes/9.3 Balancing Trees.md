## Balanced Binary Search Trees
- Creating a BST with 1 through 10 values (in that order), is the same thing as creating a linked list
- Takes longer to find the value of 10, than it would be in a scattered tree (height of 10, vs 3,4, etc)
- We can minimise this height to reduce search time

## Red Black Trees
- Use color to help determine if tree needs to be rebalanced. New nodes are Red
- Rules:
	- Root is always black
	- No two adjacent nodes are red
	- Any path between a node any any descendant (lower) node has the same number of black nodes
- Insert and Delete just like a BST but must retain these properties

- Adding a color property to nodes

```cpp
struct Node {
	T data;
	enum {red, black} color;
	Node* leftChild;
	Node* rightChild;
};
```

### Insertion 
#### Recoloring
1. If node is added at root, change color to black
2. If node not at root, if 2 is violated, check 'uncle'

#### Rebalancing
- If rule 2 is violated
	- If node n's uncle is red
		- Change parent and uncle to black
		- Change grandparent to red
		- Make grandparent n, and repeat
	- If node n's uncle is black
		- Check the path from grandparent to n
			- Left Left (rotate right, swap colors of parent and grandparent)
				- Example: insert 3,2,1 in visualiser
			- Left Right (rotate left, then right, swap colors of  new node and grandparent)
				- Example: insert 3,1,2 in visualiser
			- Right Right (rotate left, swap colors of parent and grandparent)
				- Example: insert 1,2,3 in visualiser
			- Right Left (rotate right then left, swap colors of new node and grandparent)
				- Example: insert 1,3,2 in visualiser

### Deletion
- Delete in same way as BST, rotate / color if any properties are violated after deletion
- If a node with nullptr, children is red
	- Delete node and updated node is black
		- Example: Insert 2 1, 3, 5, delete 3 or 5
- If a node has 1 child and either the node or child (but not both) is red
	- Delete node and updated node is black
		- Example: Insert 2 1, 3, 5, delete 3 or 5

#### Double Black Nodes
- If both node to be deleted AND child are black (or the node has nullptr children and is black), the updated node becomes "double black"
	- Example: insert 2,1,3,5 delete 1
- Fixing this requires recoloring and / or rotations
	- Check sibling of the double black node

#### Rebalancing
- Consider 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
- If n's sibling is black, with at least one red child (delete 5)
	- Perform rotation (as per insertion following path to red child)
	- Recolor red child to black, sibling to red
- If n's sibling is black with all children black (delete 1)
	- Recolor sibling to red
	- Push black up
- if n's sibling is red (1,2,3,4,5,6,7 delete 1)
	- Rotate
	- Recolor
		- Sibling to black
		- Parent to red

### Summary 
#### Insertion
- Do standard BST insertion
- If two adjacent nodes are Red
	- If inserted node's uncle is red
		- Recolor
	- If inserted node's unclde is black
		- Rotate
		- Recolor

#### Deletion
- Do standard BST deletion, node gains 1 black
- While non root double black node exists
	- Check sibling and children
		- Sibling black, with at least one red child = recolor and rotate
		- Sibling black, with all black children = recolor
		- Sibling red = rotate and recolor
	- Double black root node = update to single black
