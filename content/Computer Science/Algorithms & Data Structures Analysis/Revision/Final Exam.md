| AVL Trees           | Search    | $O(\log n)$  | $O(\log n)$ | $O(\log n)$ | AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that maintain a height difference of at most 1 between the left and right subtrees of any node. This self-balancing property ensures a height of $O(\log n)$ in the worst case, providing optimal search, insertion, and deletion times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Skip Lists          | Search    | $O(\log n)$  | $O(n)$      | $O(\log n)$ | Skip lists are probabilistic data structures that maintain a hierarchy of linked lists, with each higher level being a "skip" of the lower levels. The number of levels for each element is determined randomly, with a probability of 1/2 for each level. This random balancing ensures an expected $O(\log n)$ height, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. However, the worst-case height can be $O(n)$ with a low probability. Skip lists are useful in scenarios where the simplicity and ease of implementation are prioritized over strict worst-case guarantees.                                                                                                                             |
