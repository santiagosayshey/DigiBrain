> Argue that since sorting n elements takes $O(n \cdot \log n)$ time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of n elements take  $O(n \cdot \log n)$ time in the worst case.

> [!exercise]+ Exercise 2
> Professor Bunyan believes he has uncovered a remarkable property of binary search trees. Consider searching for key k in a binary search tree that ends at a leaf. Let:
> - A be the set of keys strictly to the left of the search path. B be the set of keys on the search path itself. 
> - C be the set of keys strictly to the right of the search path.  
>   
> Professor Bunyan claims that for any a ∈ A, b ∈ B, and c ∈ C, it holds that a ≤ b ≤ c. Provide the smallest possible counterexample to disprove this claim.
