> [!exercise]+ Exercise 1
> Argue that since sorting n elements takes $O(n \cdot \log n)$ time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of n elements take  $O(n \cdot \log n)$ time in the worst case.
> 
> **Answer:**
> If we iterate over a sorted list that took $O(n \cdot \log n)$ to sort, then
