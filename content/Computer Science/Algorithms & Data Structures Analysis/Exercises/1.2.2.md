> [!exercise]+ Exercise 2 - Determine the complexity of the following code segment:
>
> ```python
> x = 5 + (15 * 20)                                     # O(1)
> for x in range (O,n):
> 	print x                                           # O(N)
> for x in range (O,n):
> 	for y in range (O,n):
> 		print x*y                                     # O(N^2)
> ```
