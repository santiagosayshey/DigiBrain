> Imagine you have developed an efficient algorithm for a Mars rover to calculate the shortest path between its current location and a designated target point. Your algorithm runs very fast in the Lab tests. However, to be considered for deployment on Mars, NASA requires a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance. Why type of guarantee needs to be provided?
> 1. Provide the guarantee with actual run-times that the algorithm will always run fast as it has shown excellent run time in the Lab, ensuring energy conservation.
> 2. Provide the worst-case complexity analysis of the algorithm can handle the most complex navigation tasks without exceeding time and energy constraints.
> 3. Providing simulation results showing that the algorithm runs faster in Martian conditions.
> 4. Provide the best-case complexity, because NASA only uses algorithms that perform well in lab tests, to ensure a margin of safety.
> 
> **Answer:** Option 2, Provide the worst case complexity analysis of the algorithm. This is a guarantee, that no matter the circumstances, the algorithm will always at least run this fast.
