> [!exercise] Exercise - Sort a list using Radix Sort
> 
> 1. **Prepare the array**:
> $$\begin{array}{l}
> \text{Unsorted Array:} \\
> \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
> \hline
> 170 & 45 & 75 & 90 & 802 & 24 & 2 & 66 \\
> \hline
> \end{array}
> \end{array}$$
> 
> 3. **Sort by the least significant digit (1s place)**: Use counting sort to sort the array based on the 1s digit. 
> 
> 4. **Sort by the next significant digit (10s place)**: Again, use counting sort to sort the array, this time based on the 10s digit.
> 
> 5. **Repeat for each significant digit**: Continue this process for each digit until you sort by the most significant digit. For the example array, the next step would be the 100s place.
> 
> 6. **Resulting Sorted Array**: After sorting by each digit, the array should be fully sorted. The progression through the steps will sort the array from the least significant digit to the most significant, resulting in a sorted array.
> 
> The steps to apply counting sort at each digit level involve:
> - **Counting occurrences** of each digit in the given position (1s, 10s, 100s, etc.) for all elements in the array.
> - **Cumulatively summing up** these counts to get the positions in the output array.
> - **Placing each number** in its correct position in the output array and updating the counts accordingly.
> 
> This exercise emphasizes understanding how Radix Sort breaks down the sorting process into manageable parts, using counting sort to effectively organize numbers by their individual digits.
