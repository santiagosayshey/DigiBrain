> [!exercise]+ Exercise 3
> The expression for the worst case runtime of the school method of multiplication is given by f(n) = 3n^2 + 2n. Which of the following notations can best describe the worst-case runtime complexity of this algorithm?
> - A: $O(n^2)$ - This notation represents an upper bound on the time complexity of the algorithm. Since the highest order term in the given expression is n^2, this notation correctly describes the growth rate of the algorithm's running time.
> - B: $Ω(n^2)$ - Omega notation represents a lower bound on the time complexity. Given that the n^2 term will dominate the runtime for large n, this also accurately represents the algorithm's complexity.
> - C: $Θ(n^2)$ - Theta notation represents a tight bound, meaning it's both an upper and lower bound. Since the leading term is n^2 and the coefficients do not change the order of growth, this is the correct tight bound for the complexity.
> - D: All of the above - Given that A, B, and C are all correct, the best description for the worst-case runtime complexity of the algorithm is indeed all of the above.
