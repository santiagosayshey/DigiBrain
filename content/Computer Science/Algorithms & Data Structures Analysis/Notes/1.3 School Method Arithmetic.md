> When adding two integers of different lengths, the number of primitive operations required is determined by the length of the longer integer. This is because each digit of the shorter integer is added to the corresponding digit of the longer integer, and any additional digits in the longer integer are also processed to account for carries. Therefore, the total number of operations equals the number of digits in the longer integer, which can be described as `max(a,b)` primitive operations, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two integers.
> 
> As for the number of digits in the output, the result of adding two integers can have at most `max(a,b) + 1` digits. This maximum occurs when a carry is generated from the addition of the most significant digits of the integers. In summary, the length of the result is determined by the longer of the two integers, with the possibility of an additional digit if a carry is generated in the final addition operation.


>[!idea] Theorem - School Method Addition
The addition of two n-digit integers requires exactly n primitive operations. The result is at most, an n+1 digit integer.

$$


\begin{array}{c@{\;}c@{\;}c@{\;}c@{\;}c}
  & 1 & 7 & 0 & 9 \\
+ & 2 & 5 & 3 & 0 \\
\hline
\text{carries} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\text{sum} & 4 & 2 & 3 & 9 \\
\end{array}

$$
In code, we implement this as follows:

```python
a=number1
b=number2
n=numberofdigits

carry=0
for i=0 to n-1 do
	s[i] = a[i] + b[i]
	carry = s[i] / base
	s[i] = s[i] % base
end for
s[n] = carry
```

>[!idea] Theorem - School Method Multiplication
The school method multiplication of two n-digit integers requires $3n^2 + 2n = n^2$ primitive operations. It results in at most, a $2n$ digit integer.



$$
\begin{array}{r}\
\\
\phantom{00}1709 \\
\times \phantom{0}25 \\
\hline
\phantom{0}8545 \text{ (partial product } a \cdot b_0\text{)} \\
34180 \text{ (partial product } a \cdot b_1\text{)} \\
\hline
42725 \text{ (add aligned partial products)}
\end{array}
$$

In pseudo code, this can be represented as follows:

```python
a=number1
b=number2
n=numberofdigits

product=0

for i=0 to n-1 do
	product = product + a * b[i] * base^[i]
end for
```


We already have a pretty fast algorithm to compute addition, but can we make a faster multiplication algorithm than $O(n^2)$?
