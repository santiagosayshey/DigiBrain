> [!idea] Introduction to Bellman-Ford Algorithm
>
> The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an **alternative shortest path algorithm** that **iteratively updates the shortest path distances**. It does this by performing a series of iterations, where the number of iterations is equal to **one less than the total number of nodes** in the graph.
>
> In each iteration, the algorithm **goes through each of the nodes inside the graph, and looks at all the outgoing edges**. If the distance to any other outgoing node is smaller than what's been recorded, this distance gets updated.
>
> This method is **similar to Dijkstra's algorithm**, but with one key difference: it's not greedy. Bellman-Ford **checks every path, rather than just the smallest distance at any given moment**. This allows processing of negative edge weights and detection of negative cycles at the cost of increased complexity.

> In practice, we often don't need to perform all |V| - 1 iterations, where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph. We can stop the iterations earlier if, during an iteration, no distances are updated. This indicates that the shortest path distances have already been found, and further iterations won't lead to any changes.


```python
function BellmanFordShortestPath(Graph, startNode):
   startNode.distance = 0                                 # O(1)
   for each node in Graph:                                # O(V)

   for i from 1 to |V| - 1:                               # O(V)

> [!idea] Time Complexity of Bellman-Ford Algorithm
> 
> The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges in the graph.
> 
> The algorithm performs $|V| - 1$ iterations, and in each iteration, it updates all the edges in the graph. Updating an edge takes constant time, so the total time complexity is $O((|V| - 1) \cdot |E|)$, which simplifies to $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$.
> 
> This time complexity is higher than Dijkstra's algorithm with a binary heap, which has a time complexity of $O((|V| + |E|) \cdot \log |V|)$. However, the Bellman-Ford algorithm's ability to handle negative edge weights makes it useful in certain scenarios where Dijkstra's algorithm is not applicable.

> [!consider] Negative Cycles in Bellman-Ford Algorithm
>
> **Negative Cycle**: A negative cycle is a cycle in a graph where the sum of the edge weights is negative.
>
> **Detection**:
> - Bellman-Ford detects negative cycles by performing an extra iteration after the `|V| - 1` iterations.
> - If any distance can be further reduced during this extra iteration, it indicates a negative cycle.
>
> **Consequences**:
> - If a negative cycle exists, the shortest path is undefined, as traversing the cycle repeatedly would decrease the total path weight indefinitely.
> - Bellman-Ford reports that no solution exists when a negative cycle is detected.
>
> **Handling**:
> - Graphs with negative cycles require special handling, such as removing the cycle or modifying the graph structure.
> - Dijkstra's algorithm cannot detect negative cycles, making Bellman-Ford suitable for graphs with negative edge weights.
