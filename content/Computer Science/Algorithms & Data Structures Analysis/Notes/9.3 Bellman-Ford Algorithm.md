> [!idea] Introduction to Bellman-Ford Algorithm

> The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an **alternative shortest path algorithm** that can:
> 
> - Handle graphs with **negative edge weights**.
> - Detect and report negative-weight cycles in the graph.
> - It has a **slower time complexity** compared to Dijkstra's algorithm.
> 
> The algorithm works by **iteratively updating the shortest path distances**. It performs this process for a **maximum of |V| - 1 iterations**, where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.

>      - Update edge A → B: distance[B] = min(∞, 0 + 4) = 4
>      - Update edge A → C: distance[C] = min(∞, 0 + 2) = 2
>      - Update edge B → E: distance[E] = min(∞, 4 + 1) = 5

>      - Update edge C → E: distance[E] = min(5, 2 + 1) = 3
>      - Update edge D → B: distance[B] = min(4, 5 + 1) = 4
>      - Update edge E → D: distance[D] = min(5, 3 + 1) = 4
>    - Iteration 2, 3, 4: No further updates

> 3. Check for negative-weight cycles:
>    - Perform updates for all edges once more
>    - If any distance values change, there is a negative-weight cycle

> The final shortest path distances from A are:
> - Distance to A: 0
> - Distance to B: 4

> [!idea] Time Complexity of Bellman-Ford Algorithm
> 
> The time complexity of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges in the graph.
> 
> The algorithm performs $|V| - 1$ iterations, and in each iteration, it updates all the edges in the graph. Updating an edge takes constant time, so the total time complexity is $O((|V| - 1) \cdot |E|)$, which simplifies to $O(|V| \cdot |E|)$.
> 
> This time complexity is higher than Dijkstra's algorithm with a binary heap, which has a time complexity of $O((|V| + |E|) \cdot \log |V|)$. However, the Bellman-Ford algorithm's ability to handle negative edge weights makes it useful in certain scenarios where Dijkstra's algorithm is not applicable.
