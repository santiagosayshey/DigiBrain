> A graph is a way to **represent connections between objects**.
>
> In a graph, **each object is represented by a vertex (or node) **, and the **connections between objects are represented by edges**. These edges can represent various types of connections, such as communication links, roads, or even abstract relationships like friendships or dependencies.

> [!idea] Terminology
>
> - **Vertex set**: The set of all nodes in a graph $G$ is called the vertex set, denoted as $V$.
>   - $n = |V|$ represents the number of vertices in the graph.
> 
> - **Edge set**: The set of all edges in a graph $G$ is called the edge set, denoted as $E$.
>   - $m = |E|$ represents the number of edges in the graph.
>   - For an edge $e = (u,v)$, we say that $e$ is an outgoing edge of $u$ and an incoming edge of $v$.
> - **Digraph:** A pair consistin
> 
> - **Incident edges**: An edge $e = (u,v)$ is said to be incident to nodes $u$ and $v$.
> 
> - **Adjacent nodes**: If an edge $e = (u,v)$ exists in the graph, nodes $u$ and $v$ are said to be adjacent.
> 
> - **Self-loop**: An edge that connects a node to itself, i.e., $e = (v,v)$, is called a self-loop.
> 
> - **Outdegree**: The outdegree of a node $v$, denoted as $\text{outdegree}(v)$, is the number of outgoing edges from $v$.
>   - $\text{outdegree}(v) = |\{(v,u) \in E\}|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality (size) of the set.
> 
> - **Indegree**: The indegree of a node $v$, denoted as $\text{indegree}(v)$, is the number of incoming edges to $v$.
>   - $\text{indegree}(v) = |\{(u,v) \in E\}|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality (size) of the set.
> 
> - **Edge weights/costs**: Graphs can have associated values or weights assigned to each edge, representing costs, distances, or other relevant quantities. The weight of an edge $e$ is often denoted as $c_e$ or $w_e$.
>   - For example, in a weighted graph, the edge set can be represented as $E = \{(u,v,c_{uv}) \mid u,v \in V\}$, where $c_{uv}$ is the weight of the edge $(u,v)$.
>- **Strongly Connected Components:** Two nodes, $u$ and $v$ belong to the same strongly connected components if there is a path from 


> [!idea] Types of Graphs
>
> - A **directed graph**, also known as a digraph, is a graph where edges have a specific direction associated with them.
>   - In a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, each edge $e \in E$ is an ordered pair $e=(u,v)$, representing a connection from node $u \in V$ to node $v \in V$.
>   - The edge $e=(u,v)$ is said to be directed from $u$ to $v$, where $u$ is the source (or initial) node and $v$ is the target (or terminal) node.
>
> 	- In a directed graph, the edges are represented using arrows to indicate the direction of the connection.
> 		  - For example, an edge $(u,v)$ is represented as $u \rightarrow v$, showing the direction from $u$ to $v$.
>
> 	- The presence of an edge $(u,v)$ in a directed graph does not imply the existence of an edge $(v,u)$ in the opposite direction, unless explicitly specified.
>
> - A **bidirected graph** $G=(V,E)$ is a directed graph (digraph) where for every edge $(u,v)$, there is also an edge $(v,u)$ in the opposite direction.
>   - In other words, if there is a connection from node $u$ to node $v$, there must also be a connection from node $v$ to node $u$.
>   - We can write an edge in a bidirected graph as an unordered pair $\{u,v\}$ since the direction of the edge is not important.
> 
> - An **undirected graph** can be seen as a simplified representation of a bidirected graph.
>   - In an undirected graph, edges have no specific direction, and the connection between two nodes is represented by a single edge.
>   - An edge in an undirected graph is also written as an unordered pair $\{u,v\}$.
