>
> In a graph, **each object is represented by a node**, and the **connections between objects are represented by edges**. These edges can represent various types of connections, such as communication links, roads, or even abstract relationships like friendships or dependencies.

> [!idea] Terminology
>
> - **Vertex set**: The set of all nodes in a graph $G$ is called the vertex set, denoted as $V$.
>   - $n = |V|$ represents the number of vertices in the graph.
> 
> - **Edge set**: The set of all edges in a graph $G$ is called the edge set, denoted as $E$.
>   - $m = |E|$ represents the number of edges in the graph.
>   - For an edge $e = (u,v)$, we say that $e$ is an outgoing edge of $u$ and an incoming edge of $v$.
> - **Digraph:** A pair consistin
> 
> - **Incident edges**: An edge $e = (u,v)$ is said to be incident to nodes $u$ and $v$.
> 
> - **Adjacent nodes**: If an edge $e = (u,v)$ exists in the graph, nodes $u$ and $v$ are said to be adjacent.
> 
> - **Self-loop**: An edge that connects a node to itself, i.e., $e = (v,v)$, is called a self-loop.
> 
> - **Outdegree**: The outdegree of a node $v$, denoted as $\text{outdegree}(v)$, is the number of outgoing edges from $v$.
>   - $\text{outdegree}(v) = |\{(v,u) \in E\}|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality (size) of the set.
> 
> - **Indegree**: The indegree of a node $v$, denoted as $\text{indegree}(v)$, is the number of incoming edges to $v$.
>   - $\text{indegree}(v) = |\{(u,v) \in E\}|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality (size) of the set.
> 
> - **Edge weights/costs**: Graphs can have associated values or weights assigned to each edge, representing costs, distances, or other relevant quantities. The weight of an edge $e$ is often denoted as $c_e$ or $w_e$.
>   - For example, in a weighted graph, the edge set can be represented as $E = \{(u,v,c_{uv}) \mid u,v \in V\}$, where $c_{uv}$ is the weight of the edge $(u,v)$.


> [!idea] Types of Graphs
>
> - A **directed graph**, also known as a digraph, is a graph where edges have a specific direction associated with them.
>   - In a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, each edge $e \in E$ is an ordered pair $e=(u,v)$, representing a connection from node $u$ to node $v$.
>   - The edge $e=(u,v)$ is said to be directed from $u$ to $v$, where $u$ is the source (or initial) node and $v$ is the target (or terminal) node.
>
> - In a directed graph, the edges are represented using arrows to indicate the direction of the connection.
>   - For example, an edge $(u,v)$ is represented as $u \rightarrow v$, showing the direction from $u$ to $v$.
>
> - The presence of an edge $(u,v)$ in a directed graph does not imply the existence of an edge $(v,u)$ in the opposite direction, unless explicitly specified.
>
> - A **bidirected graph** $G=(V,E)$ is a directed graph (digraph) where for every edge $(u,v)$, there is also an edge $(v,u)$ in the opposite direction.
>   - In other words, if there is a connection from node $u$ to node $v$, there must also be a connection from node $v$ to node $u$.
>   - We can write an edge in a bidirected graph as an unordered pair $\{u,v\}$ since the direction of the edge is not important.
> 
> - An **undirected graph** can be seen as a simplified representation of a bidirected graph.
>   - In an undirected graph, edges have no specific direction, and the connection between two nodes is represented by a single edge.
>   - An edge in an undirected graph is also written as an unordered pair $\{u,v\}$.
> 

> [!idea] Subgraphs
> 
> A **subgraph** is a graph that is contained within another graph. More formally:
> 
> - A graph $G'=(V',E')$ is a **subgraph** of $G=(V,E)$ if $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.
>   - In other words, the nodes and edges of $G'$ are subsets of the nodes and edges of $G$.
> 
> - Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset of nodes $V' \subseteq V$, the **induced subgraph** $G'=(V',E')$ is defined as:
>   - $V' \subseteq V$
>   - $E' = \{(u,v) \in E \mid u,v \in V'\}$
>   - The induced subgraph contains all the nodes in $V'$ and all the edges from $E$ that connect nodes in $V'$.
> 
> Subgraphs are useful for focusing on specific parts or regions of a larger graph. By extracting a subgraph, we can analyze or process a smaller portion of the graph that is relevant to a particular problem or question.
> 
> > [!consider] Real-life examples
> >
> > - In a social network graph, a subgraph could represent a specific community or group of people with strong connections among themselves.
> > - In a transportation network graph, a subgraph could represent a specific region or a particular mode of transportation, such as a subway system within a larger transportation network.

> > In the image above, the graph on the right is a subgraph of the larger graph on the left. The subgraph focuses on a specific region of interest within the larger graph.

> [!idea] Paths and Cycles
> 
> - A path is a sequence of nodes where each consecutive pair of nodes is connected by an edge. 
> - A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.
>
> > [!consider] Taking a trip
> > 
> > A path is like the route you would take on a road trip from one city to another, passing through other cities along the way. A cycle would be a route that takes you back to your starting point.

> [!idea] Trees and Forests
>
> - A tree is a special undirected graph where there is exactly one path between any two nodes. 
> - A forest is a collection of trees.
>  
>  > [!consider] Family trees
>  >
>  > A family tree is a good example of a tree graph, showing the relationships between family members without any cycles.

> [!idea] Graph Traversal - BFS
> 
> Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a way to traverse or explore a graph by visiting all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the neighbors' neighbors. 
>
> > [!consider] Ripples in a pond
> >
> > BFS is like the way ripples spread out in a pond when you throw a stone. They expand outward uniformly, reaching the closest points before spreading further.

The document would then provide more details and examples for each of these key ideas, maintaining an accessible and engaging tone to make the concepts easy to understand for a general audience.

Let me know if you would like me to actually create the full document with the detailed explanations for each callout! I can generate that as a separate document.
