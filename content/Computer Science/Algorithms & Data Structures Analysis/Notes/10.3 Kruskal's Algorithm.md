> Kruskal's Algorithm is a **greedy algorithm that finds a Minimum Spanning Tree** (MST) in a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. It operates by following these steps:
>
> 1. **Sort all the edges** in increasing order of their weights.
> 2. Initialize an empty set `mst` to store the edges of the MST.
> 3. **Iterate** through the sorted edges:
>    - By running `find` on the two nodes, we can determine if they belong to the same set. 
>    - If they do belong to the same set, discard the current edge and move to the next one.
>    - Otherwise, add the edge to the `mst`
> 1. Repeat step 3 until `mst` contains `|V| - 1` edges, where `|V|` is the number of vertices in the graph.

> The resulting set `mst` contains the edges that form the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph.

>      - Since A and C are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operation), discard this edge to avoid creating a cycle.

>      - Since C and D are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operations), discard this edge to avoid creating a cycle.

>    - (D, E): 7
>      - Find the sets containing vertices D and E.
>      - Since D and E are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operations), discard this edge.

> The resulting MST contains the edges: (B, C), (A, B), (B, D), (C, E), with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13.

> [!consider] Time Complexity Analysis
> 
> Let's analyze the time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm and the Union-Find data structure used in the algorithm.
> 
> **Kruskal's Algorithm:**
> - Sorting the edges of the graph takes $O(E \log E)$ time, where $E$ is the number of edges in the graph. This is typically done using an efficient sorting algorithm like Quicksort or Mergesort.
> - The main loop of Kruskal's Algorithm iterates over the sorted edges, which takes $O(E)$ time.
>   - For each edge, the `find` operation is called twice (once for each vertex) to determine the sets they belong to. The [[Amortized Analysis|amortized]] time complexity of the `find` operation is nearly constant (assumed to be $O(\alpha(n))$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly).
>   - If the vertices belong to different sets, the `union` operation is called to merge the sets. The `union` operation also has a nearly constant amortized time complexity (assumed to be $O(\alpha(n))$).
> - Therefore, the overall time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is $O(E \log E)$ for sorting the edges and $O(E \cdot \alpha(n))$ for the main loop, which simplifies to $O(E \log E)$ since $\alpha(n)$ is nearly constant.
