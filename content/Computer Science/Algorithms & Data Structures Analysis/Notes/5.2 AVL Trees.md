> [!idea]+ Imbalanced BSTs
> Recall than an imbalanced Binary Search Tree can degrade into a structure similar to a linked list, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of $O(n)$ for common operations. To address this issue and ensure optimal performance, we can proactively balance the BST during its construction and modification. By **maintaining a balanced structure with a height of $\log n$, the time complexity of key operations becomes $O(\log n)$** in the worst case, significantly improving upon the linear time complexity of an imbalanced tree.
