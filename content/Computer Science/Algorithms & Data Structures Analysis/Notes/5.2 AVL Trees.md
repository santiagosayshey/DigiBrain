> [!idea]+ Imbalanced BSTs
> Recall than an imbalanced Binary Search Tree can degrade into a structure similar to a linked list, resulting in a worst-case time complexity of $O(n)$ for common operations. To address this issue and ensure optimal performance, we can proactively balance the BST during its construction and modification. By **maintaining a balanced structure with a height of $\log n$, the time complexity of key operations becomes $O(\log n)$** in the worst case, significantly improving upon the linear time complexity of an imbalanced tree. One type of these self balancing trees is an **AVL Tree.**

>An AVL tree says that for any node, the height of it's two subtrees differs by at most, 1 node, i.e. $Balance \; Factor \in {-1,0,1}$

> The `balance` function is a method of the AVL tree class and takes four parameters:
> - `self`: The instance of the AVL tree class.
> - `root`: The root node of the subtree to be balanced.
> - `key`: The key of the newly inserted or deleted node.
> - `balance_factor`: The balance factor of the root node.
>
> The function returns the new root of the balanced subtree after performing the necessary rotations based on the balance factor and the key.

> [!idea]+ Left Rotation
>
> A left rotation is performed when a node's right subtree is causing an imbalance. The node is rotated to the left, making its right child the new root of the subtree, and the old node becomes the left child of the new root. The new root's left subtree becomes the right subtree of the old node.

> [!idea]+ AVL Deletion
 The `delete` function removes a node with the given `key` from the AVL tree. It follows these steps:
>
> 1. If the `root` is `None`, return `root` as there is nothing to delete.
> 2. If the `key` is less than the `root`'s key, recursively delete the key from the left subtree.
> 3. If the `key` is greater than the `root`'s key, recursively delete the key from the right subtree.
> 4. If the `key` is equal to the `root`'s key, we have found the node to delete:
>    - If the `root` has no left child, replace the `root` with its right child and return the right child.
>    - If the `root` has no right child, replace the `root` with its left child and return the left child.
>    - If the `root` has both left and right children:
>      - Find the inorder successor `temp` (the smallest node in the right subtree).
>      - Replace the `root`'s key with the `temp` node's key.
>      - Recursively delete the `temp` node from the right subtree.
> 5. Update the height of the current `root` node.
> 6. Calculate the balance factor of the current `root` node.
> 7. If the balance factor is greater than 1 and the left subtree's balance factor is greater than or equal to 0, perform a right rotation.
> 8. If the balance factor is less than -1 and the right subtree's balance factor is less than or equal to 0, perform a left rotation.
> 9. If the balance factor is greater than 1 and the left subtree's balance factor is less than 0, perform a left-right rotation.
