> - **Process**:
>    1. Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
>    2. For each unvisited vertex, perform a BFS to mark all reachable vertices.
>    3. Each BFS from an unvisited vertex identifies all the vertices in one connected component.
>    4. Repeat until all vertices have been visited and associated with a component.

> - **Example**: Consider an undirected graph with vertices A, B, C, D, and E where edges connect A-B, B-C, and D-E.
>    - Starting BFS from vertex A, we will visit A, B, and C marking them as one connected component.
>    - Then, starting BFS from the next unvisited vertex, D, we visit D and E, marking them as another component.

> 1. **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**:
>    - **Purpose**: To determine the order of nodes based on how "late" they finish being explored. This helps us decide where to start in the second pass.
>    - **Process**: Start a DFS from any node and keep exploring until you can't go further, then backtrack. Record the order in which you finish exploring each node.
>
> 2. **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**:
>    - **Preparation**: Reverse all the arrows (edges) in the graph.
>    - **Purpose**: To find all the nodes that can reach back to the starting node under this reversed setup.
>    - **Process**: Using the order from DFS-1, start another DFS for each unvisited node. The set of nodes you visit before you have to stop is an SCC.
>
> **Example**: Imagine a simple graph with three nodes, A, B, and C, connected in a loop (A → B → C → A):
> - **First Pass**: Suppose we start at A and end up marking the finish order as C, B, A.
> - **Second Pass**: After reversing the edges, we start at A (since it finished last in DFS-1). This DFS will loop through A, B, and C, marking all as part of the same SCC because they are interconnected.

> This method effectively identifies different loops or interconnected clusters within a directed graph, ensuring that each component is recognized based on mutual reachability.
