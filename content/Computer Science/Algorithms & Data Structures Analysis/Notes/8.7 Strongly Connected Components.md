> [!example] Using DFS to Identify Strongly Connected Components in Directed Graphs
>
> **Depth First Search (DFS)** is a powerful method for identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) in directed graphs, which are clusters of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in the cluster. The identification process involves two passes of DFS:
>
> 1. **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**:
>    - **Purpose**: To determine the traversal finish order of nodes based on their exploration depth. This ordering helps in prioritizing nodes for the next DFS pass.
>    - **Process**: Start a DFS from any unvisited node and explore as deep as possible. Record when you finish exploring each node (when it's added to the visited list and all possible explorations are complete).
>
> 2. **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**:
>    - **Preparation**: Reverse all the directions of the edges in the graph.
>    - **Purpose**: To explore how nodes can reach back to the start node under the reversed conditions.
>    - **Process**: Using the finish order from DFS-1, perform DFS starting from the node with the highest finish order. Each complete traversal identifies all nodes in one SCC.
>
> **Example**: Consider a graph with vertices A, B, C connected in a loop (A → B → C → A):
> - **First Pass**: Starting at A might finish in the order of C, B, A. 
> - **Second Pass**: With reversed edges and starting at A (last finished), the DFS will revisit A, B, and C, marking all as part of the same SCC since they are interconnected.
>
> This method effectively segments the graph into components, with each pass of DFS ensuring every node is processed only once, improving efficiency and clarity in identifying interconnected groups.
