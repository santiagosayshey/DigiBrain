> **Breadth First Search (BFS) is a straightforward approach** for finding all connected components in an undirected graph:
>
> - **Process**:
>    1. Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
>    2. For each unvisited vertex, perform a BFS to mark all reachable vertices.
>    3. Each BFS from an unvisited vertex identifies all the vertices in one connected component.
>    4. Repeat until all vertices have been visited and associated with a component.
>
> - **Example**: Consider an undirected graph with vertices A, B, C, D, and E where edges connect A-B, B-C, and D-E.
>    - Starting BFS from vertex A, we will visit A, B, and C marking them as one connected component.
>    - Then, starting BFS from the next unvisited vertex, D, we visit D and E, marking them as another component.

> **Depth First Search (DFS)** can also be used to find these components through a two-pass process:
>
> 1. **First Pass (DFS-1)**:
>    - Perform a DFS on the original graph to get a finish time for each vertex. This helps in identifying which vertices to process first in the next pass.
>    - Vertices are then sorted by their finish times in decreasing order.
>
> 2. **Second Pass (DFS-2)**:
>    - Reverse the directions of all edges in the graph.
>    - Perform a DFS starting from the vertex with the highest finish time (from DFS-1). Each complete DFS from a starting node identifies all vertices in one SCC.
>    - Repeat DFS for each unvisited vertex according to the order determined in the first pass.
>
> **Example**: Consider a graph with vertices A, B, C where there are edges from A to B, B to C, and C to A. 
>
> - In the first DFS, the vertices might be finished in the order C, B, A (depending on the start vertex).
> - In the second pass on the reversed graph, starting a DFS at A (since it has the latest finish time in this example) will visit all vertices (A, B, C), identifying them as a single strongly connected component because they can all reach each other in the reversed graph.
>
> This process ensures that each SCC is identified independently, using the finishing times to guide the order of processing, which is crucial for the correct identification of components.
