> [!example] Using DFS to Identify Strongly Connected Components in Directed Graphs
>
> **Depth First Search (DFS)** is a powerful method for identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) in directed graphs, which are clusters of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in the cluster. The identification process involves two passes of DFS:
>
> 1. **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**:
>    - **Purpose**: To determine the traversal finish order of nodes based on their exploration depth. This ordering helps in prioritizing nodes for the next DFS pass.
>    - **Process**: Start a DFS from any unvisited node and explore as deep as possible. Record when you finish exploring each node (when it's added to the visited list and all possible explorations are complete).
>
> 2. **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**:
>    - **Preparation**: Before this pass, reverse the direction of every edge in the graph. For example, if there is a directed edge from A to B in the original graph, it would be reversed to B to A. This reversal is key to identifying the SCCs.
>    - **Purpose**: To discover groups of nodes that are mutually reachable under the reversed edge conditions.
>    - **Process**: Using the finish order from DFS-1 (starting with the node that finished last), conduct another DFS. The set of nodes you visit before you can no longer traverse further forms one SCC. Once an SCC is fully traversed, move to the next highest node in the finish order that has not yet been visited, and repeat the process.
>
> **Example**: Consider a simple graph with three nodes A, B, and C, where edges direct from A to B, B to C, and C back to A:
> - **First Pass**: Assume we start at A and finish exploring in the order C, B, A.
> - **Reversal**: Reverse all edges, so they now point C to B, B to A, and A to C.
> - **Second Pass**: Begin the second DFS at A (the last finished node). This pass will explore all nodes connected under the new reversed edges, discovering that A, B, and C are still interconnected, confirming they form a single SCC. Once no further traversal is possible, indicating the SCC is fully identified, move to the next node that hasn't been visited in this pass. (There are no more nodes in this example)
>
> This method ensures precise identification of all SCCs, leveraging the finish order to efficiently segment the graph into interconnected groups.
