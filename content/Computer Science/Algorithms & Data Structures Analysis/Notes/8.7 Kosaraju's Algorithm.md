> [!example] Finding Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
> **Breadth First Search (BFS)** is an effective method for identifying all connected components in an undirected graph:
>
> - **Process**:
>   1. Initialize all vertices as unvisited.
>   2. For each unvisited vertex, perform a BFS to mark all reachable vertices.
>   3. Each BFS from an unvisited vertex identifies all the vertices in one connected component.
>   4. Repeat until all vertices have been visited and associated with a component.
>
> - **Example**: In an undirected graph with vertices A, B, C, D, and E where edges connect A-B, B-C, and D-E:
>   - Starting BFS from vertex A will visit A, B, and C, marking them as one connected component.
>   - Starting BFS from D, the next unvisited vertex, will identify D and E as another component.


> [!consider] Finding SCCs in Directed Graphs
> In directed graphs, SCCs are crucial for understanding the deep connectivity between nodes. The identification of SCCs can be complex due to the directional nature of connections. Kosaraju’s algorithm, which involves two passes of Depth First Search (DFS), is a robust method for tackling this complexity:
>
> 1. **First DFS Pass**: Identify the order to process nodes based on when they finish being explored.
> 2. **Second DFS Pass**: Reverse the graph’s edges and use the order from the first pass to explore and identify SCCs.

### Kosaraju's Algorithm for SCCs
> [!idea] Kosaraju’s Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components
> **Depth First Search (DFS)** is used in Kosaraju's Algorithm to identify SCCs in directed graphs through a two-pass process:
>
> 1. **First DFS Pass (DFS-1)**:
>    - **Purpose**: Record the finish order of nodes to prioritize for the second pass.
>    - **Process**: Start DFS from any unvisited node, explore as deep as possible, and record the finish order.
>
> 2. **Second DFS Pass (DFS-2)**:
>    - **Preparation**: Reverse all graph edges.
>    - **Purpose**: Discover groups of nodes that can reach each other under the new edge directions.
>    - **Process**: Use the finish order from DFS-1 to conduct another DFS, identifying SCCs.
>
> **Example**: In a graph with nodes A, B, and C connected in a loop (A → B → C → A):
> - **First Pass**: Finish order might be C, B, A.
> - **Reversal**: Edges are reversed to C → A, B → C, A → B.
> - **Second Pass**: Start DFS at A, discovering that A, B, and C form a single SCC.

These structured callouts efficiently compartmentalize information, making it easier to understand the various aspects of finding connected components and strongly connected components in both undirected and directed graphs, respectively.
