> Balanced Binary Search Trees (BSTs) offer a dynamic, highly efficient way to store data that is always sorted, allowing for fast retrieval similar to that of a sorted array. However, unlike arrays, balanced BSTs are designed to maintain optimal balance through various algorithms, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees, ensuring that operations like **search, insertion and deletion can be performed in logarithmic time complexity**. 

| Operation          | Description                                    | Balanced BST Running Time |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Search             | Find a node with a given value                 | $O(\log n)$               |
| Insert             | Add a node with a given value                  | $O(\log n)$               |
| Delete             | Remove a node with a given value               | $O(\log n)$               |
| Min / Max          | Find the smallest/largest value in the tree    | $O(\log n)$               |
| Predecessor        | Find the next smaller value before a given key | $O(\log n)$               |
| Successor          | Find the next larger value after a given key   | $O(\log n)$               |
| Rank               | Number of keys less than a given value         | $O(\log n)$               |
| Select             | Find the k-th smallest value in the tree       | $O(\log n)$               |
| In-Order Traversal | Output values in sorted order                  | <center>$O(n)$</center>   |
