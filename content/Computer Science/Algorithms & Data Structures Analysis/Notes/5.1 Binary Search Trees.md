> Balanced Binary Search Trees (BSTs) offer a dynamic, highly efficient way to store data that is always sorted, allowing for fast retrieval similar to that of a sorted array. However, unlike arrays, balanced BSTs are designed to maintain optimal balance through various algorithms, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees, ensuring that operations like **search, insertion and deletion can be performed in logarithmic time complexity**.
