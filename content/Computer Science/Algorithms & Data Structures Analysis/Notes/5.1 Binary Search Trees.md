> Balanced Binary Search Trees (BSTs) offer a dynamic, highly efficient way to store data that is always sorted, allowing for fast retrieval similar to that of a sorted array. However, unlike arrays, balanced BSTs are designed to maintain optimal balance through various algorithms, such as [[5.2 AVL Trees|AVL trees]] or Red-Black trees, ensuring that operations like **search, insertion and deletion can be performed in logarithmic time complexity**.

> The **Search Tree Property** is a fundamental characteristic of a Binary Search Tree. It states that for any node x in the BST, **all keys in the left subtree of x must be less than x** , and **all keys in the right subtree of x must be greater than x**. This property should hold at every node of the tree, ensuring that the keys are stored in a sorted manner. By maintaining the Search Tree Property, BSTs enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

> In-Order Traversal is a way to **visit all the nodes of a BST in ascending order of their keys**. It follows a specific sequence: first, it recursively traverses the left subtree, then visits the current node, and finally, it recursively traverses the right subtree. The in-order traversal of a BST produces a sorted sequence of keys, which is particularly useful when you need to process the nodes in sorted order. Some common applications of in-order traversal include printing the keys in ascending order, performing range queries efficiently by leveraging the sorted order of keys, and validating the correctness of a BST by checking if the in-order traversal produces a sorted sequence. The time complexity of in-order traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as it visits each node exactly once.

> [!consider] Consider the height of a BST
> It's important to note that there are multiple possible binary search trees for the same set of keys. The structure of a BST can vary widely, depending on the order of insertion and deletion of keys. The image above shows valid BSTs for a set of elements.
> 
> The height of a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a crucial factor in determining the running time of search, insertion, and deletion operations. In a **perfectly balanced BST** of height $\log{n}$, the height is logarithmic in relation to the number of nodes, resulting in efficient **$O(\log n)$** time complexity for these operations.
>
> However, in the worst-case scenario, when the **BST is skewed or unbalanced,** the height can become linear, leading to a time complexity of **$O(n)$** for search, insertion, and deletion. This occurs when the BST resembles a linked list, with each node having only one child.

> [!idea]+ BST Insertion
> The `insert` function inserts a new node with the given `key` into the AVL tree. It follows these steps:
>
> 1. If the `root` is `None`, create a new node with the given `key` and return it as the new root.
> 2. If the `key` is less than the `root`'s key, recursively insert the key into the left subtree.
> 3. If the `key` is greater than or equal to the `root`'s key, recursively insert the key into the right subtree.
> 10. Return the updated `root` of the subtree.

> ```python
> def insert(self, root, key):
>     if not root:
>         return Node(key)
>     elif key < root.key:
>         root.left = self.insert(root.left, key)
>     else:
>         root.right = self.insert(root.right, key)
