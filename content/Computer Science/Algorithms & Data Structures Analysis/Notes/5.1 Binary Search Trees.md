> Balanced Binary Search Trees (BSTs) offer a dynamic, highly efficient way to store data that is always sorted, allowing for fast retrieval similar to that of a sorted array. However, unlike arrays, balanced BSTs are designed to maintain optimal balance through various algorithms, such as [[5.2 AVL Trees|AVL trees]] or Red-Black trees, ensuring that operations like **search, insertion and deletion can be performed in logarithmic time complexity**.

> The **Search Tree Property** is a fundamental characteristic of a Binary Search Tree. It states that for any node x in the BST, **all keys in the left subtree of x must be less than x** , and **all keys in the right subtree of x must be greater than x**. This property should hold at every node of the tree, ensuring that the keys are stored in a sorted manner. By maintaining the Search Tree Property, BSTs enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

> In-Order Traversal is a way to **visit all the nodes of a BST in ascending order of their keys**. It follows a specific sequence: first, it recursively traverses the left subtree, then visits the current node, and finally, it recursively traverses the right subtree. The in-order traversal of a BST produces a sorted sequence of keys, which is particularly useful when you need to process the nodes in sorted order. Some common applications of in-order traversal include printing the keys in ascending order, performing range queries efficiently by leveraging the sorted order of keys, and validating the correctness of a BST by checking if the in-order traversal produces a sorted sequence. The time complexity of in-order traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as it visits each node exactly once.

> [!consider] Consider the height of a BST
> It's important to note that there are multiple possible binary search trees for the same set of keys. The structure of a BST can vary widely, depending on the order of insertion and deletion of keys. The image above shows valid BSTs for a set of elements.
> 
> The height of a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a crucial factor in determining the running time of search, insertion, and deletion operations. In a **perfectly balanced BST** of height $\log{n}$, the height is logarithmic in relation to the number of nodes, resulting in efficient **$O(\log n)$** time complexity for these operations.
>
> However, in the worst-case scenario, when the **BST is skewed or unbalanced,** the height can become linear, leading to a time complexity of **$O(n)$** for search, insertion, and deletion. This occurs when the BST resembles a linked list, with each node having only one child.

> [!idea]+ BST Deletion
 The `delete` function removes a node with the given `key` from the AVL tree. It follows these steps:
>
> 1. If the `root` is `None`, return `root` as there is nothing to delete.
> 2. If the `key` is less than the `root`'s key, recursively delete the key from the left subtree.
> 3. If the `key` is greater than the `root`'s key, recursively delete the key from the right subtree.
> 4. If the `key` is equal to the `root`'s key, we have found the node to delete:
>    - If the `root` has no left child, replace the `root` with its right child and return the right child.
>    - If the `root` has no right child, replace the `root` with its left child and return the left child.
>    - If the `root` has both left and right children:
>      - Find the inorder successor `temp` (the smallest node in the right subtree).
>      - Replace the `root`'s key with the `temp` node's key.
>      - Recursively delete the `temp` node from the right subtree.
> 11. Return the updated `root` of the subtree.
