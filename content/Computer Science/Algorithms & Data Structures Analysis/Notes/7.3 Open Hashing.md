> Each array index points to a linked list.
> - When a collision happens, the key-value pair is **appended to the linked list** at that index, allowing multiple pairs to be stored.
> - Searching for a key involves **traversing the linked list** at the corresponding index to find the desired value.
> - Deleting a value requires adjusting the pointers in the linkedlist
