> [!idea]+ Linear Sorting
> Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that runs in linear time with respect to two variables, $k$ and $n$. It **ONLY** works with numbers that span from 1 to $k$, i.e. positive numbers only.
> - $k$ is the largest number in the list
> - $n$ is the length of the list
>   
> Counting sort runs in $O(n+k)$ in the worst case. It works by:
> - Counting the occurrence of each number in the list
> - Based on these occurrences, determining the position of each number in the sorted list
