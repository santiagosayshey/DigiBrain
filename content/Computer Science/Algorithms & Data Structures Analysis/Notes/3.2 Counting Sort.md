> [!idea]+ Linear Sorting
> Counting sort is a [[Stable Sort|stable]] sorting algorithm that runs in linear time with respect to two variables, $k$ and $n$. It **ONLY** works with numbers that span from 1 to $k$, i.e. positive numbers only.
> - $k$ is the largest number in the list
> - $n$ is the length of the list
>   
> Counting sort runs in $O(n+k)$ in the worst case. It works by:
> - Counting the occurrence of each number in the list
> - Based on these occurrences, determining the position of each number in the sorted list

> [!idea] Pseudocode - Input `A[1..n]`, Output `B[1..n]`, Storage `C[1..k]`
> ```python
> def CountingSort(A, B, k):
>     # Initialize the count array C[1..k]. O(k)
> 	C = []
> 	for i in range(k + 1):
> 	   C.append(0)
> 
>     # Count the occurrences of each number in array A. O(n)
>     for j in range(1, len(A) + 1):
>         C[A[j]] += 1
> 
>     # Update the count array to contain the position of the number. O(k)
>     for i in range(2, k + 1):
>         C[i] = C[i] + C[i - 1]
> 
>     # Build the output array B. O(n)
>     for j in range(len(A), 0, -1):
>         B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
>         C[A[j]] -= 1

> We don't always want to use counting sort because it has quite a large space complexity. We need an array of size K for storage.
