> A Disjoint Set is a way to **keep track of elements that belong to different sets**. It's like having a bunch of boxes, and each element is placed in one of these boxes. Initially, each element starts in its own separate box.

> 2. **Union(x, y)**: It's like saying, "Let's merge the boxes containing elements x and y into a single bigger box." The Union operation combines the boxes (sets) that contain elements x and y, so they become part of the same group.

> [!idea] Implementation of a Disjoint Set Data Structure
>
> A disjoint set data structure, also known as a union-find data structure, is used to keep track of a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. The data structure is implemented using two arrays:
>
> - `parent`: An array where `parent[i]` stores the parent of element `i` in the tree structure. If an element is the root of a tree (i.e., it is its own parent), then `parent[i] = i`.
>
> - `rank`: An array where `rank[i]` stores the rank (an upper bound on the height) of the subtree rooted at element `i`.
>
> Here's the pseudo code for the disjoint set data structure:
>
> ```python
> function makeSet(x):
>     parent[x] := x
>     rank[x] := 0
>
> function find(x):
>     if parent[x] ≠ x:
>         parent[x] := find(parent[x])  # Path compression
>     return parent[x]
>
> function union(x, y):
>     rootX := find(x)
>     rootY := find(y)
>     if rootX ≠ rootY:
>         if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
>             parent[rootX] := rootY
>         else if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
>             parent[rootY] := rootX
>         else:
>             parent[rootY] := rootX
>             rank[rootX] := rank[rootX] + 1

> - The `makeSet` function initializes a new subset with a single element `x`. It sets the parent of `x` to itself and initializes its rank to 0.
>
> - The `find` function recursively follows the parent pointers until it reaches the root element (where `parent[x] = x`). This condition allows it to iterate over the entire set and return it from the top parent. By running find on two nodes, we can know if the two nodes are in the same set, if the returned sets are equal.
>
> - The `union` function merges two subsets by finding the roots (representatives) of the subsets that contain elements `x` and `y` using the `find` function. If the roots are different (i.e., `x` and `y` belong to different subsets), it attaches the subtree with smaller rank to the root of the subtree with larger rank. If the ranks are equal, either subtree can be attached to the other, and the rank of the resulting subtree is incremented.
