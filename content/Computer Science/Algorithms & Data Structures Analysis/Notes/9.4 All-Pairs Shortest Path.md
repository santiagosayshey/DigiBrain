> [!idea] Introduction to All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)
>
> The All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem aims to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. In other words, for every pair of vertices $(i, j)$ in the graph, we want to find the shortest path from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.
>
> The APSP problem has several important applications, such as:
> - Finding the shortest routes between all locations in a transportation network
> - Analyzing social networks to determine the shortest connections between individuals
> - Identifying the most efficient paths for data flow in computer networks
>
> There are various algorithms to solve the APSP problem, including:
> - Running Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm for each vertex as the source
> - **Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which uses dynamic programming to solve APSP**
> - Johnson's algorithm, which combines Dijkstra's algorithm with the Bellman-Ford algorithm
>
> The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the graph's structure, the presence of negative edge weights, and the desired time complexity.
