> [!motivation] Importance of Efficient Algorithms
> As computational problems grow in size and complexity, the **need for efficient algorithms becomes increasingly crucial**. Inefficient algorithms can lead to impractical running times and resource usage, making certain problems infeasible to solve. By understanding the efficiency of algorithms, we can make **informed decisions about which algorithms to use for specific problems, ensuring that we can obtain solutions in a reasonable amount of time** and with acceptable resource consumption.

> [!idea] P and NP Classes
> - P (Polynomial) is the class of decision problems that can be **solved in polynomial time**.
> 	- Shortest path
> 	- Maximum flow
> 	- Linear programming.
> - NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial) is the class of decision problems for which a solution can be **verified in polynomial time**.
> 	-  Traveling salesman
> 	- Boolean satisfiability
> 	- Graph coloring.
> - All problems in P are also in NP, but it is unknown whether P = NP or P ≠ NP.

> [!consider] Implications of P vs. NP
> - If P = NP, many difficult problems could be solved efficiently, revolutionizing fields such as cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.
> - If P ≠ NP, it would mean that there are problems in NP that cannot be solved efficiently, and approximation algorithms or heuristics would be necessary for such problems.
> - The P vs. NP problem is one of the most important open questions in computer science and has significant implications for the field and beyond.
