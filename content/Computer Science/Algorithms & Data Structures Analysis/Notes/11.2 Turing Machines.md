> [!motivation] Motivation

> In the realm of computational theory, **determining whether a problem can be solved by an algorithm is a fundamental question**. With the diversity of computational devices and programming languages, it becomes essential to have a unified way to **understand what problems can be solved** by any computational means.

> [!idea] Turing Machine
>
> A Turing Machine is a theoretical model of computation introduced by Alan Turing. It consists of an infinite tape, a tape head that can read and write symbols, and **a set of rules (or a finite state machine) that dictate the machine's actions based on the current state** and tape symbol.
> 
> - **Components**: The tape (divided into cells), the tape head (which reads and writes symbols), and the state register (which holds the current state).
> - **Operations**: The machine can move the tape head left or right, read a symbol from the tape, write a new symbol on the tape, and change its state according to the transition function.
> - **Purpose**: It **abstracts the concept of computation and helps define what it means for a function to be computable**. By specifying a set of rules that a machine follows to manipulate symbols, it can be used to show that a problem is computable if a Turing Machine can be designed to solve it. Conversely, if no Turing Machine can solve a problem, that problem is deemed non-computable.
> - **Computability**: Essentially, a Turing Machine acts as **a black box that takes inputs and processes them according to its rules**. If the machine halts and provides outputs for given inputs, it proves that the problem is computable. If no Turing Machine can be constructed to solve a problem, it is considered non-computable.

> [!example] Hello World Turing Machine
>
> Creating a "Hello World" Turing Machine involves designing a set of states and transitions that write "Hello World" on the tape.
>
> - **Initial State**: The machine starts with a blank tape and the tape head at the leftmost position.
> - **Transition Function**: 
>   - State `q0`: Write `H`, move right, go to state `q1`
>   - State `q1`: Write `e`, move right, go to state `q2`
>   - State `q2`: Write `l`, move right, go to state `q3`
>   - State `q3`: Write `l`, move right, go to state `q4`
>   - State `q4`: Write `o`, move right, go to state `q5`
>   - State `q5`: Write ` ` (space), move right, go to state `q6`
>   - State `q6`: Write `W`, move right, go to state `q7`
>   - State `q7`: Write `o`, move right, go to state `q8`
>   - State `q8`: Write `r`, move right, go to state `q9`
>   - State `q9`: Write `l`, move right, go to state `q10`
>   - State `q10`: Write `d`, move right, go to state `q11`
>   - State `q11`: Halt
> - **Result**: The tape will have "Hello World" written on it, demonstrating the machine's ability to perform specific, predefined tasks.

> [!idea] Turing Completeness
>
> A system is Turing complete if it can simulate any Turing Machine. This means it can solve any problem that is computationally solvable, given enough time and resources.
> 
> - **Definition**: A programming language or computational system is Turing complete if it can simulate the computation of any Turing Machine.
> - **Criteria**: The system must have conditional branching (like `if` statements), a form of repetition or looping (like `while` or `for` loops), and the ability to read and write an arbitrary amount of data.

> [!example] Examples of Turing Complete Systems
>
> - **Minecraft Redstone**: Believe it or not, you can build a fully functional computer inside Minecraft using Redstone circuits. Players have created everything from calculators to full-fledged CPUs, making Minecraft a playground for digital logic and Turing completeness.
> - **Magic: The Gathering**: In 2019, researchers proved that a sufficiently complex game of Magic: The Gathering can simulate a Turing Machine. This means you could, in theory, decide computational problems while battling with your favorite cards.
> - **Conway's Game of Life**: This cellular automaton, consisting of simple rules for cell survival and reproduction, can simulate a universal constructor. You could say it's like having a tiny, living computer on your screen!
> - **PowerPoint**: Yes, even PowerPoint can be Turing complete. By using slide transitions and hyperlinks in creative ways, you can simulate computational processes. Who knew your next presentation could double as a computing engine?
> - **Baking Recipes**: Imagine a cookbook that is Turing complete. By meticulously following a set of rules (steps), where each ingredient and instruction acts like a state transition, you can bake a cake while theoretically solving any computable problem. It might not be the most efficient way to compute, but it sure is delicious!
> - **Esoteric Programming Languages (Esolang)**: Languages like Brainfuck and Befunge are intentionally designed to be as confusing and impractical as possible, yet they are Turing complete. Writing code in these languages feels like solving a riddle wrapped in an enigma, but it's computationally powerful!
