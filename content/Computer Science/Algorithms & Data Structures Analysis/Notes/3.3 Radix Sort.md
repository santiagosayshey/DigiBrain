> [!idea]+ Radix Sort
>
> Radix Sort is an efficient, non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. It uses Counting Sort as a stable subroutine to sort the numbers in each pass.
>
> The key advantages of Radix Sort are:
> 1. It has a linear time complexity of $O(d * (n + k))$, where $d$ is the number of digits, $n$ is the number of elements, and $k$ is the range of input.
> 2. It is a stable sort, preserving the relative order of elements with equal keys.
> 3. It can be optimized by using a larger radix, reducing the number of passes required to sort the numbers.
>
> However, Radix Sort has some limitations:
> 1. It is only suitable for integers or elements that can be represented as integers.
> 2. The space complexity is $O(n + k)$, which can be significant for large datasets or a large range of input.
> 3. The performance depends on the number of digits and the radix chosen. Choosing an optimal radix is crucial for efficiency.

> The image explains the Radix Sort algorithm and provides an example of sorting 1 million 64-bit numbers:
> - Radix Sort treats the 64-bit numbers as four-digit radix $2^{16}$ numbers.
> - It can sort these numbers in just four passes using the radix sort algorithm.
> - The time complexity is $\Theta(b/r * (n + 2^r))$, where $n$ is the number of elements, $b$ is the number of bits per element, and $r$ is the base/radix.

> In the given example:
> $n = 1,000,000$ (1 million numbers)
> $b = 64$ (64-bit numbers)
> $r = 16$ (treating as base $2^{16}$)
>
> The Radix Sort time is calculated as:
> $\Theta(64/16 * (1,000,000 + 2^{16}))$
> $= \Theta(4 * 1,065,536)$
> $= \Theta(4,262,144)$
>
> In summary, Radix Sort is a powerful and efficient algorithm for sorting integers, especially when the number of elements is large, and the range of input is known. Its linear time complexity and stability make it a preferred choice in certain scenarios, such as sorting large datasets or as a subroutine in other algorithms.
