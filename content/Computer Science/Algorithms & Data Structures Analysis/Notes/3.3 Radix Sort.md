> [!idea]+ Radix Sort
> Radix sort is used to sort numbers from their least significant digit to their most significant digit. [[3.2 Counting Sort|Counting Sort]] is used as the subroutine to sort the digits, because it is [[Stable Sort|stable]] and asymptotically fast - $O(dn + dk) = O(n)$
> 
> It's important that the sorting subroutine is stable and starts with the least significant digit, because we want to preserve the previously sorted digit's order.
