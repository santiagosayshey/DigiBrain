> Kruskal's Algorithm is a **greedy algorithm that finds a Minimum Spanning Tree** (MST) in a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. It operates by following these steps:
>
> 1. **Sort all the edges** in increasing order of their weights.
> 2. Initialize an empty set `mst` to store the edges of the MST.
> 3. **Iterate** through the sorted edges:
>    - If adding the **current edge to `mst` does not create a cycle, include it in `mst`**. This check is performed using the Union-Find data structure.
>    - Otherwise, discard the current edge and move to the next one.
> 4. Repeat step 3 until `mst` contains `|V| - 1` edges, where `|V|` is the number of vertices in the graph.
>
> The resulting set `mst` contains the edges that form the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph.

> [!motivation] Motivation for Union-Find Data Structure
> 
> We need to **determine whether adding an edge would create a cycle.** This requires keeping track of connected components in the graph and quickly checking if two vertices belong to the same component.
> 
> We can achieve this using a **union-find data structure**. 

> [!idea] Union-Find Data Structure
>
> A union-find data structure is a way to **keep track of elements that belong to different sets**. It's like having a bunch of boxes, and each element is placed in one of these boxes. Initially, each element starts in its own separate box.
>
> The union-find data structure provides two main operations:
>
> 1. **Find(x)**: It's like asking, "Which box is element x in?" The Find operation tells you the representative or label of the box that contains element x. Elements in the same box have the same representative.
>
> 2. **Union(x, y)**: It's like saying, "Let's merge the boxes containing elements x and y into a single bigger box." The Union operation combines the boxes (sets) that contain elements x and y, so they become part of the same group.
>
> You can think of the union-find data structure as a way to partition elements into different groups and keep track of which elements belong together.
>
> In Kruskal's Algorithm, we use the union-find data structure to keep track of connected components in the graph. Each vertex starts in its own separate "box" (set). As we process the edges:
>
> 1. We use the **Find** operation to determine which "boxes" (sets) the two vertices of the current edge belong to.
>
> 2. If the vertices are in different "boxes" (sets), it means they aren't connected yet, so we can safely add the edge to the MST. We then use the **Union** operation to merge the "boxes" (sets) containing the vertices, indicating that they are now connected.
>
> 3. If the vertices are already in the same "box" (set), it means they are already connected, and adding the edge would create a cycle. In this case, we discard the edge.

> [!idea] Implementation of Union-Find Using List-Oriented Approach
> 
> In the list-oriented implementation of the union-find data structure, we utilize an array and a list to manage the sets and their elements effectively:
> 
> - **Array R**: An array of size `n` where `R[i]` indicates the name of the set to which element `i` belongs. This direct association allows quick access to the set identifier for any element.
> 
> - **Linked List L(A)**: For each set `A`, there is a list `L(A)` that contains all elements of set `A`. This list is crucial for merging sets efficiently.
> 
> **Operations**:
> 
> - **Find(x)**: Returns the set name of element `x`, which is directly obtained from the array `R[x]`. This operation is constant time, O(1), because it involves a simple array access.
> 
> - **Union(x, y)**: Merges the sets containing `x` and `y`. The roots of the sets `x` and `y` belong to are found using the `Find` operation. If they are different, the elements of the smaller set are moved to the larger set, and the set identifiers in `R` are updated accordingly. This operation ensures that all elements in the merged set reflect the correct set identifier.
> 
> The list-oriented approach optimizes the union operation by always merging the smaller list into the larger one, thereby minimizing the number of elements that need to be updated. This method effectively supports Kruskal's algorithm by ensuring that merging sets and checking for connected components is done efficiently.

> [!consider] Time Complexity Analysis
> 
> Let's analyze the time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm and the Union-Find data structure used in the algorithm.
> 
> **Kruskal's Algorithm:**
> - Sorting the edges of the graph takes $O(E \log E)$ time, where $E$ is the number of edges in the graph. This is typically done using an efficient sorting algorithm like Quicksort or Mergesort.
> - The main loop of Kruskal's Algorithm iterates over the sorted edges, which takes $O(E)$ time.
>   - For each edge, the `find` operation is called twice (once for each vertex) to determine the sets they belong to. The [[Amortized Analysis|amortized]] time complexity of the `find` operation is nearly constant (assumed to be $O(\alpha(n))$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly).
>   - If the vertices belong to different sets, the `union` operation is called to merge the sets. The `union` operation also has a nearly constant amortized time complexity (assumed to be $O(\alpha(n))$).
> - Therefore, the overall time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is $O(E \log E)$ for sorting the edges and $O(E \cdot \alpha(n))$ for the main loop, which simplifies to $O(E \log E)$ since $\alpha(n)$ is nearly constant.

>      - Find the sets containing vertices A and B.
>      - Since A and B are in different sets, add the edge (A, B) to `mst` and perform the Union operation to merge the sets containing A and B.
>    - (A, C): 3
>      - Find the sets containing vertices A and C.
>      - Since A and C are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operation), discard this edge to avoid creating a cycle.

>      - Find the sets containing vertices B and D.
>      - Since B and D are in different sets, add the edge (B, D) to `mst` and perform the Union operation to merge the sets containing B and D.

>      - Find the sets containing vertices C and D.
>      - Since C and D are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operations), discard this edge to avoid creating a cycle.
>    - (C, E): 6
>      - Find the sets containing vertices C and E.
>      - Since C and E are in different sets, add the edge (C, E) to `mst` and perform the Union operation to merge the sets containing C and E.
>    - (D, E): 7
>      - Find the sets containing vertices D and E.
>      - Since D and E are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operations), discard this edge.
> 
> The resulting MST contains the edges: (B, C), (A, B), (B, D), (C, E), with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13.
