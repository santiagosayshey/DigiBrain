Certainly! Let's revise the example to incorporate the union-find data structure and demonstrate how it is used in Kruskal's Algorithm:

By using the union-find data structure, Kruskal's Algorithm efficiently determines whether adding an edge would create a cycle. The Find operation checks if the vertices of an edge belong to the same set, indicating a connected component. If they are in different sets, the edge is added to the MST, and the Union operation merges the sets. If the vertices are already in the same set, adding the edge would create a cycle, so it is discarded.

The union-find data structure allows Kruskal's Algorithm to efficiently track connected components and build the MST without creating cycles.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations
> 
> - **Time Complexity**: Kruskal's Algorithm has a time complexity of $O(E \log E)$ or $O(E \log V)$, where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph. This complexity arises from the need to sort the edges and perform disjoint set operations to detect cycles.
> 
> - **Disjoint Set Data Structure**: To efficiently detect cycles while adding edges to the MST, Kruskal's Algorithm often uses a disjoint set data structure (also known as a union-find data structure). This data structure allows for quick checks of whether two vertices belong to the same connected component and merges components when necessary.
> 
> - **Uniqueness of MST**: If all edge weights in the graph are distinct, the resulting MST is unique. However, if there are multiple edges with the same weight, there can be multiple valid MSTs. Kruskal's Algorithm will find one of the possible MSTs in such cases.
> 
> - **Disconnected Graphs**: Kruskal's Algorithm can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest in a disconnected graph. In this case, the algorithm will find a minimum spanning tree for each connected component of the graph.
> 
> By understanding these aspects of Kruskal's Algorithm, you can effectively apply it to solve MST problems and optimize network designs in various domains.
