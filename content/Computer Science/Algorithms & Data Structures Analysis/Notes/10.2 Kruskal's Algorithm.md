Hello!

I would like your assistance in writing concise, modular notes on the topic of Kruskal's Algorithm The goal is to create notes that are easy to understand and focused on key ideas rather than verbatim copying from textbooks. 

Please use the following note-taking format. Please understand the way its formatted is only to explain to you HOW you should write it, not the exact format in which you should write it. Ie, you dont need to write, purpose, key elements and example. Thats just to describe what should be covered.

> [!motivation] Motivation
> 
> **Purpose**: Introduce the problem that motivates the need for the main idea. This callout sets the stage, making the upcoming discussion relevant and urgent.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Contextual Introduction**: Start with a real-world scenario or problem that illustrates the need for a solution.
> - **Problem Framing**: Clearly outline the properties or issues that the main idea addresses. Avoid mentioning the solution; focus solely on setting up the problem. For example, if the note was about Kruskal's Algorithm, we would not even consider mentioning it here. It is a solution to this problem.
>

> **Example**:
> - Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm offers a solution to the minimum spanning tree problem in graph theory. It processes edges of a graph in ascending order of their weights and adds them to the spanning tree, ensuring no cycles are formed, until all vertices are connected. This method efficiently addresses the need for minimal connection costs in networks.

> 
> **Example**:
> - Consider a network of five nodes where the goal is to connect all nodes with the least total weight. Using Kruskal's Algorithm, we start by selecting the smallest edge, ensuring no cycles are created, and continue until all nodes are interconnected. This process results in a spanning tree with minimized connection costs.

Additionally, explore how variations of the algorithm might behave in directed graphs or with negative weights. These considerations are crucial for adapting the algorithm to more complex or specialized scenarios.

This structure ensures that each callout is detailed and purposeful, enhancing the clarity and depth of your notes.
You may also include the following elements in the callouts:

- Tables: Please ensure that tables follow markdown formatting rules.
- Images: Indicate where the image should be placed and provide a description so that I can find or create a suitable image (e.g., drawing a graph to illustrate Dijkstra's algorithm in Figma). This is very important. Whenever you want to include an image, You NEED to describe it. Perhaps write the explanation in a codeblock so that I know it can be deleted later. 
- Math: When including mathematical equations, please use Obsidian's formatting rules - `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for equation blocks.

I have provided additional context on the desired notes below. Please use this information as a guide for what you should write:

I have provided PDFs which you should use to follow the list of things you may want to talk about. Also please note that we have already made a note for MSTs, seen below. So theres no need to rehash anything already talked about there.

> [!motivation] Motivation
>
> In many real-world scenarios, we need to connect a set of points or nodes in a way that minimizes the total cost or weight of the connections. For example:
>
> - **Computer Networks**: Connect devices (routers, switches, etc.) with minimal cabling or infrastructure cost.
> - **Transportation Networks**: Build roads or railways to connect cities or locations with minimal construction cost.
> - **Utility Networks**: Connect households or facilities to water, electricity, or communication services with minimal resource usage.
>
> In these situations, we want to **ensure that all points or nodes are connected (forming a single component), while minimizing the overall cost or weight of the connections**. This leads us to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem.

> [!idea] Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Problem
>
> Given a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with positive edge costs/weights:
>
> - Edge costs are positive, implying that the connected subgraph of minimal cost **does not contain a cycle**.
> - It is a **tree spanning all nodes** of the graph (called a spanning tree).
>
> The goal is to find a subset of edges $E' \in E$ that forms a tree $T = (V, E')$ such that:
>
> 1. $T$ **includes all vertices $V$** from the original graph $G$.
> 2. $T$ is a tree, meaning it is a connected graph with **no cycles**.
> 3. The total cost/weight of the **edges in $E'$ is minimised** among all possible spanning trees of $G$.
> - This is called the **Minimal Spanning Tree**
>
> Mathematically, an MST of a given graph $G$ can be constructed using greedy algorithms, based on the following crucial properties:
>
> - **Cut Property:** Let $e$ be an edge of minimum cost in a cut $C$. Then there exists an MST that contains $e$.
> - **Cycle Property:** An edge of maximal cost in any cycle does not need to be considered for computing an MST.

> [!example] Real-World Example
>
> Consider a computer network where nodes represent computers, and edges represent possible connections. Edge costs/weights represent the cost of establishing connections. The goal is to connect all computers while minimizing the total infrastructure cost.
>
> ![[MST Example 2.png]]]
>
> In this example, the original graph has all possible connections with a total cost/weight of 25.
>
> The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) includes the edges (1, 2) with cost 1, (2, 4) with cost 2, (1, 3) with cost 3, (3, 4) with cost 3, and (1, 5) with cost 5. The total cost/weight of this MST is 14, the minimum among all possible spanning trees.
>
> By selecting this subset of edges, we can connect all 5 computers while minimizing the total infrastructure cost. The MST has a lower cost of 14 compared to 25 for the original graph.

> [!consider] Cut Property
>
> A cut in a connected graph is a **set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph into two or more components**. The Cut Property states that an edge of minimum cost/weight in any cut belongs to some Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph.
>
> ![[Cut Example.png|400]]
>
> Consider the graph shown in the image. The dashed line represents a cut that separates the graph into two components: the set of vertices {1, 2, 3} and the set of vertices {4, 5}. The edges crossing the cut are (2, 4) with cost 2, and (3, 4) with cost 3.
>
> The Cut Property says that the **edge of minimum cost/weight in this cut**, which is (2, 4) with cost 2, **must belong to some MST** of the graph.
>
> The Cut Property is **crucial for greedy** algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's, as it **allows them to include the minimum-cost edge in the current cut**, ensuring that the resulting spanning tree is indeed a minimum-cost spanning tree.

> [!consider] Cycle Property
>
> The Cycle Property states that the **maximum-cost edge in any cycle can be excluded** when computing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
>
> ![[Cycle Property.png|400]]
>
> In the graph above, the cycle {1, 2, 3, 4} contains the edge (4, 1) with the maximum cost of 5. This edge can be safely excluded when finding the MST, as removing the maximum-cost edge from a cycle reduces the total cost.
>
> The Cycle Property allows pruning unnecessary edges, potentially improving the efficiency of MST algorithms.


Thanks!

> Kruskal's Algorithm is a specific approach to solving the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. 

> [!idea] Kruskal's Algorithm
> 
> Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. It operates by following these steps:
> 
> 1. Sort all the edges in increasing order of their weights.
> 2. Initialize an empty set `mst` to store the edges of the MST.
> 3. Iterate through the sorted edges:
>    - If adding the current edge to `mst` does not create a cycle, include it in `mst`.
>    - Otherwise, discard the current edge and move to the next one.
> 4. Repeat step 3 until `mst` contains `|V| - 1` edges, where `|V|` is the number of vertices in the graph.
> 
> The resulting set `mst` contains the edges that form the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph.
> 
> Kruskal's Algorithm leverages the Cut Property of MSTs, which states that the minimum-weight edge across any cut in the graph must be part of an MST. By selecting edges in non-decreasing order of weights and avoiding cycles, Kruskal's Algorithm ensures that it always includes the minimum-weight edge that connects two disjoint components of the graph, ultimately leading to an MST.

> [!example] Example of Kruskal's Algorithm
> 
> Let's consider the following example graph to illustrate how Kruskal's Algorithm works:
> 
> ```
> [Describe an example graph with 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E) and the following weighted edges:
> - (A, B): 2

> - (B, C): 1
> - (B, D): 4
> - (C, D): 5
> - (C, E): 6
> - (D, E): 7]
> ```
> 
> Now, let's apply Kruskal's Algorithm to find the MST:
> 
> 1. Sort the edges in non-decreasing order of weights:
>    - (B, C): 1
>    - (A, B): 2
>    - (A, C): 3
>    - (B, D): 4
>    - (C, D): 5
>    - (C, E): 6
>    - (D, E): 7
> 
> 2. Initialize an empty set `mst`.
> 
> 3. Iterate through the sorted edges:
>    - (B, C): 1 - Add to `mst` since it doesn't create a cycle.
>    - (A, B): 2 - Add to `mst` since it doesn't create a cycle.
>    - (A, C): 3 - Discard since it creates a cycle (A-B-C-A).
>    - (B, D): 4 - Add to `mst` since it doesn't create a cycle.
>    - (C, D): 5 - Discard since it creates a cycle (B-C-D-B).
>    - (C, E): 6 - Add to `mst` since it doesn't create a cycle.
>    - (D, E): 7 - Discard since `mst` already contains `|V| - 1 = 4` edges.
> 
> The resulting MST contains the edges: (B, C), (A, B), (B, D), (C, E), with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13.

> ```
> [Describe an image illustrating the example graph and the resulting MST, highlighting the selected edges.]
> ```

> [!consider] Additional Considerations
> 
> - **Time Complexity**: Kruskal's Algorithm has a time complexity of $O(E \log E)$ or $O(E \log V)$, where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph. This complexity arises from the need to sort the edges and perform disjoint set operations to detect cycles.
> 
> - **Disjoint Set Data Structure**: To efficiently detect cycles while adding edges to the MST, Kruskal's Algorithm often uses a disjoint set data structure (also known as a union-find data structure). This data structure allows for quick checks of whether two vertices belong to the same connected component and merges components when necessary.
> 
> - **Uniqueness of MST**: If all edge weights in the graph are distinct, the resulting MST is unique. However, if there are multiple edges with the same weight, there can be multiple valid MSTs. Kruskal's Algorithm will find one of the possible MSTs in such cases.
> 
> - **Disconnected Graphs**: Kruskal's Algorithm can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest in a disconnected graph. In this case, the algorithm will find a minimum spanning tree for each connected component of the graph.
> 
> By understanding these aspects of Kruskal's Algorithm, you can effectively apply it to solve MST problems and optimize network designs in various domains.
