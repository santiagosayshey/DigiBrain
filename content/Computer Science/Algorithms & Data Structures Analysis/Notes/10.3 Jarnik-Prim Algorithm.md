Hello!

I would like your assistance in writing concise, modular notes on the topic of Jarnik-Prim Algorithm The goal is to create notes that are easy to understand and focused on key ideas rather than verbatim copying from textbooks. 

I would like you to format the note using 'callouts'. An explanation for how you should write (not how the callout should be formatted and organised) is given below. 

> [!motivation] Motivation
> 
> **Purpose**: Introduce the problem that motivates the need for the main idea. This callout sets the stage, making the upcoming discussion relevant and urgent.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Contextual Introduction**: Start with a real-world scenario or problem that illustrates the need for a solution.
> - **Problem Framing**: Clearly outline the properties or issues that the main idea addresses. Avoid mentioning the solution; focus solely on setting up the problem. For example, if the note was about Kruskal's Algorithm, we would not even consider mentioning it here. It is a solution to this problem.
> 
> **Example**:
> - In project management and network planning, there's often a need to minimize resource usage while achieving maximum efficiency. Imagine trying to connect multiple offices with the least amount of cabling. 
> 
This sets the stage for understanding how we can optimize connections in a network, paving the way for a solution that ensures all nodes are connected with minimal costs.

> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept
> 
> **Purpose**: Explain the core concept or idea that addresses the problem introduced in the motivation callout.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Definition**: Provide a clear, concise definition or explanation of the main concept.
> - **Mechanics**: Describe how the concept works in theoretical or abstract terms.
> - **Relevance**: Tie back to the motivation by explaining how this idea effectively solves the problem.
> 
> **Example**:
> - Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm offers a solution to the minimum spanning tree problem in graph theory. It processes edges of a graph in ascending order of their weights and adds them to the spanning tree, ensuring no cycles are formed, until all vertices are connected. This method efficiently addresses the need for minimal connection costs in networks.

> [!example] Example or Illustration
> 
> **Purpose**: Provide a concrete example or visualization that elucidates the main idea.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Illustrative Example**: Use a specific case, possibly with visual aids or diagrams, to show the idea in action.
> - **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Break down how the example fits or demonstrates the main idea.
> - **Relevance**: Highlight the practical impact or benefits observed in the example.
> 
> **Example**:
> - Consider a network of five nodes where the goal is to connect all nodes with the least total weight. Using Kruskal's Algorithm, we start by selecting the smallest edge, ensuring no cycles are created, and continue until all nodes are interconnected. This process results in a spanning tree with minimized connection costs.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas
> 
> **Purpose**: Expand on the main idea by introducing related concepts, further implications, or advanced considerations.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Broader Implications**: Discuss the broader impact or applications of the main idea.
> - **Related Concepts**: Introduce and explain additional theories or ideas that complement or contrast with the main idea.
> - **Complex Considerations**: Address any complexities or nuances that add depth to the understanding of the main idea.
> 
> **Example**:
> - While implementing Kruskal's Algorithm, consider the union-find data structure for efficient cycle detection. Additionally, explore how variations of the algorithm might behave in directed graphs or with negative weights. These considerations are crucial for adapting the algorithm to more complex or specialized scenarios.

This structure ensures that each callout is detailed and purposeful, enhancing the clarity and depth of your notes.
You may also include the following elements in the callouts:

- Tables: Please ensure that tables follow markdown formatting rules.
- Images: Indicate where the image should be placed and provide a description so that I can find or create a suitable image (e.g., drawing a graph to illustrate Dijkstra's algorithm in Figma). This is very important. Whenever you want to include an image, You NEED to describe it. Perhaps write the explanation in a codeblock so that I know it can be deleted later. 
- Math: When including mathematical equations, please use Obsidian's formatting rules - `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for equation blocks.

I have provided additional context on the desired notes below. Please use this information as a guide for what you should write:

I have already completed notes on Minumum Spanning Trees and Kruskal's Algorithm. This note follows on from them. They can be found below. 



> [!motivation] Motivation
>
> In many real-world scenarios, we need to connect a set of points or nodes in a way that minimizes the total cost or weight of the connections. For example:
>
> - **Computer Networks**: Connect devices (routers, switches, etc.) with minimal cabling or infrastructure cost.
> - **Transportation Networks**: Build roads or railways to connect cities or locations with minimal construction cost.
> - **Utility Networks**: Connect households or facilities to water, electricity, or communication services with minimal resource usage.
>
> In these situations, we want to **ensure that all points or nodes are connected (forming a single component), while minimizing the overall cost or weight of the connections**. This leads us to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem.
> 
> 

> [!idea] Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Problem
>
> Given a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with positive edge costs/weights:
>
> - Edge costs are positive, implying that the connected subgraph of minimal cost **does not contain a cycle**.
> - It is a **tree spanning all nodes** of the graph (called a spanning tree).
>
> The goal is to find a subset of edges $E' \in E$ that forms a tree $T = (V, E')$ such that:
>
> 1. $T$ **includes all vertices $V$** from the original graph $G$.
> 2. $T$ is a tree, meaning it is a connected graph with **no cycles**.
> 3. The total cost/weight of the **edges in $E'$ is minimised** among all possible spanning trees of $G$.
> - This is called the **Minimal Spanning Tree**
>
> Mathematically, an MST of a given graph $G$ can be constructed using greedy algorithms, based on the following crucial properties:
>
> - **Cut Property:** Let $e$ be an edge of minimum cost in a cut $C$. Then there exists an MST that contains $e$.
> - **Cycle Property:** An edge of maximal cost in any cycle does not need to be considered for computing an MST.

> [!example] Real-World Example
>
> Consider a computer network where nodes represent computers, and edges represent possible connections. Edge costs/weights represent the cost of establishing connections. The goal is to connect all computers while minimizing the total infrastructure cost.
>
> ![[MST Example 2.png]]]
>
> In this example, the original graph has all possible connections with a total cost/weight of 25.
>
> The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) includes the edges (1, 2) with cost 1, (2, 4) with cost 2, (1, 3) with cost 3, (3, 4) with cost 3, and (1, 5) with cost 5. The total cost/weight of this MST is 14, the minimum among all possible spanning trees.
>
> By selecting this subset of edges, we can connect all 5 computers while minimizing the total infrastructure cost. The MST has a lower cost of 14 compared to 25 for the original graph.

> [!consider] Cut Property
>
> A cut in a connected graph is a **set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph into two or more components**. The Cut Property states that an edge of minimum cost/weight in any cut belongs to some Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph.
>
> ![[Cut Example.png|400]]
>
> Consider the graph shown in the image. The dashed line represents a cut that separates the graph into two components: the set of vertices {1, 2, 3} and the set of vertices {4, 5}. The edges crossing the cut are (2, 4) with cost 2, and (3, 4) with cost 3.
>
> The Cut Property says that the **edge of minimum cost/weight in this cut**, which is (2, 4) with cost 2, **must belong to some MST** of the graph.
>
> The Cut Property is **crucial for greedy** algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's, as it **allows them to include the minimum-cost edge in the current cut**, ensuring that the resulting spanning tree is indeed a minimum-cost spanning tree.

> [!consider] Cycle Property
>
> The Cycle Property states that the **maximum-cost edge in any cycle can be excluded** when computing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
>
> ![[Cycle Property.png|400]]
>
> In the graph above, the cycle {1, 2, 3, 4} contains the edge (4, 1) with the maximum cost of 5. This edge can be safely excluded when finding the MST, as removing the maximum-cost edge from a cycle reduces the total cost.
>
> The Cycle Property allows pruning unnecessary edges, potentially improving the efficiency of MST algorithms.



> [!idea] Kruskal's Algorithm
>
> Kruskal's Algorithm is a **greedy algorithm that finds a Minimum Spanning Tree** (MST) in a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. It operates by following these steps:
>
> 1. **Sort all the edges** in increasing order of their weights.
> 2. Initialize an empty set `mst` to store the edges of the MST.
> 3. **Iterate** through the sorted edges:
>    - If adding the **current edge to `mst` does not create a cycle, include it in `mst`**. This check is performed using the Union-Find data structure.
>    - Otherwise, discard the current edge and move to the next one.
> 4. Repeat step 3 until `mst` contains `|V| - 1` edges, where `|V|` is the number of vertices in the graph.
>
> The resulting set `mst` contains the edges that form the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph.
>
> ```c
> function kruskal(graph):
>     edges = sort(graph.edges)  // Step 1
>     uf = UnionFind(graph.vertices)  // Step 2
>     mst = []
>
>     for each edge (u, v, weight) in edges:  // Step 3
>         set_u = uf.find(u)
>         set_v = uf.find(v)
>
>         if set_u â‰  set_v:
>             add edge (u, v, weight) to mst
>             uf.union(set_u, set_v)
>
>     return mst
> ```

> [!motivation] Motivation for Union-Find Data Structure
> 
> We need to **determine whether adding an edge would create a cycle.** This requires keeping track of connected components in the graph and quickly checking if two vertices belong to the same component.
> 
> We can achieve this using a **union-find data structure**. 

> [!idea] Union-Find Data Structure
>
> A union-find data structure is a way to **keep track of elements that belong to different sets**. It's like having a bunch of boxes, and each element is placed in one of these boxes. Initially, each element starts in its own separate box.
>
> The union-find data structure provides two main operations:
>
> 1. **Find(x)**: It's like asking, "Which box is element x in?" The Find operation tells you the representative or label of the box that contains element x. Elements in the same box have the same representative.
>
> 2. **Union(x, y)**: It's like saying, "Let's merge the boxes containing elements x and y into a single bigger box." The Union operation combines the boxes (sets) that contain elements x and y, so they become part of the same group.
>
> You can think of the union-find data structure as a way to partition elements into different groups and keep track of which elements belong together.
>
> In Kruskal's Algorithm, we use the union-find data structure to keep track of connected components in the graph. Each vertex starts in its own separate "box" (set). As we process the edges:
>
> 1. We use the **Find** operation to determine which "boxes" (sets) the two vertices of the current edge belong to.
>
> 2. If the vertices are in different "boxes" (sets), it means they aren't connected yet, so we can safely add the edge to the MST. We then use the **Union** operation to merge the "boxes" (sets) containing the vertices, indicating that they are now connected.
>
> 3. If the vertices are already in the same "box" (set), it means they are already connected, and adding the edge would create a cycle. In this case, we discard the edge.

> [!idea] Implementation of Union-Find Using List-Oriented Approach
>
> This union-find implementation utilizes an array and lists within a class structure, allowing efficient management of disjoint sets. The structure uses a list for each set and an array to quickly map elements to their corresponding set identifiers.
>
> **Class Structure**:
> - **Array R**: Stores the set identifier for each element. This direct mapping allows for O(1) complexity for the `find` operation.
> - **List L(A)**: Maintains a list of elements for each set `A`, which helps in efficient merging of sets.
>
> **Pseudocode**:
> ```c
> class UnionFind:
>     function __init__(n):
>         self.R = new array of size n
>         self.L = new array of lists of size n
>         for i from 0 to n-1 do
>             self.R[i] = i  // Initially, each element is its own set
>             self.L[i] = new list containing i  // Initialize list for each element
>
>     function find(x):
>         return self.R[x]  // Direct lookup of the set identifier
>
>     function union(x, y):
>         rootX = self.find(x)
>         rootY = self.find(y)
>         if rootX â‰  rootY then
>             if length(self.L[rootX]) < length(self.L[rootY]) then
>                 self.merge(rootX, rootY)  // Merge smaller list into the larger one
>             else
>                 self.merge(rootY, rootX)  // Merge smaller list into the larger one
>
>     function merge(smaller, larger):
>         for element in self.L[smaller] do
>             self.R[element] = larger  // Update the set identifier in R
>         self.L[larger].extend(self.L[smaller])  // Extend the larger list with elements of the smaller
>         self.L[smaller] = []  // Clear the smaller list after merging
> ```
>
> **Explanation**:
> - The `UnionFind` class initializes with every element in its own set. The `find` method provides an efficient way to determine the set identifier for any element.
> - The `union` method checks if two elements belong to different sets and merges the smaller set into the larger one to maintain a balanced structure. This minimizes the number of elements that need to be moved during a merge, optimizing the process.
> - The `merge` method handles the actual merging of two sets. It updates the set identifiers for all elements in the smaller set and transfers these elements to the larger set's list, ensuring the structure remains efficient for future operations.




> [!consider] Time Complexity Analysis
> 
> Let's analyze the time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm and the Union-Find data structure used in the algorithm.
> 
> **Kruskal's Algorithm:**
> - Sorting the edges of the graph takes $O(E \log E)$ time, where $E$ is the number of edges in the graph. This is typically done using an efficient sorting algorithm like Quicksort or Mergesort.
> - The main loop of Kruskal's Algorithm iterates over the sorted edges, which takes $O(E)$ time.
>   - For each edge, the `find` operation is called twice (once for each vertex) to determine the sets they belong to. The [[Amortized Analysis|amortized]] time complexity of the `find` operation is nearly constant (assumed to be $O(\alpha(n))$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly).
>   - If the vertices belong to different sets, the `union` operation is called to merge the sets. The `union` operation also has a nearly constant amortized time complexity (assumed to be $O(\alpha(n))$).
> - Therefore, the overall time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is $O(E \log E)$ for sorting the edges and $O(E \cdot \alpha(n))$ for the main loop, which simplifies to $O(E \log E)$ since $\alpha(n)$ is nearly constant.

>    - (D, E): 7
>      - Find the sets containing vertices D and E.
>      - Since D and E are now in the same set (due to the previous Union operations), discard this edge.
> 
> The resulting MST contains the edges: (B, C), (A, B), (B, D), (C, E), with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13.
