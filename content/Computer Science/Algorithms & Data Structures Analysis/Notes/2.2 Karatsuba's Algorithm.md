> Recall in the [[2.1 Standard Multiplication Algorithm|Recursive Multiplication Method]], our time complexity is actually not reduced below $O(n^2)$. Enter the [Karatsuba Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm), a faster Divide and Conquer multiplication algorithm $\approx O(n^{1.59})$.
>
> The method is quite similar to its predecessor, but instead of calculating 4 partial products, we only need 3. On the surface, this single multiplication decrease seems trivial, but we must understand that there is an entire operation removed PER sub level. This greatly reduces the worst-case complexity of the algorithm.

> If you can prove the base case and the inductive step, then you have successfully proven that the solution holds for all values of $n$ using the substitution method.

> In the Karatsuba method, leaf nodes are reached more quickly compared to the recursive school method. The Karatsuba algorithm has a shallower tree structure with fewer levels, allowing it to arrive at the base cases (leaf nodes) faster.
