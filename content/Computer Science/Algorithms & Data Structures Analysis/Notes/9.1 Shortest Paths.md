> [!idea] Shortest Paths
> 
> Shortest path algorithms aim to **find the path with the minimum total cost or distance between two nodes in a graph**. Given a starting vertex, the goal is to determine the shortest path to reach any other vertex.

> [!consider] Real-World Applications
>
> - **Navigation systems**: Finding the quickest route between locations.
> - **Network routing**: Determining efficient paths for data packets in computer networks.
> - **Robot motion planning**: Calculating optimal paths for robots to navigate environments.

> [!idea] Problem Statement
>
> - Given a **directed graph G = (V, E)** with vertices V and edges E.
> - Given a **cost function c(u, v)** representing the cost or distance of each edge (u, v) ∈ E.
> - Given a **starting vertex s ∈ V**, find the shortest path from s to every other vertex v ∈ V.

> [!consider] Non-Negative Edge Costs
>
> For simplicity, shortest path algorithms often assume **non-negative edge costs**. This allows the use of efficient algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm. Variations like the Bellman-Ford algorithm handle negative edge costs.

> [!idea] Properties of Shortest Paths
>
> **Subpaths of a shortest path are also shortest paths**. If the shortest path from s to v passes through u, then the subpath from s to u and the subpath from u to v are also shortest paths.
