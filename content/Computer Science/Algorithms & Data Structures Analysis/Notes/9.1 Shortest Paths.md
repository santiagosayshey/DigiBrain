> In a graph, the **route that minimises the total weight of the edges between any two nodes** is the shortest path between those two nodes.
 > 
> In mathematical terms: 
> - We have a graph $G$ with nodes $V$ and edges $E$. 
> - Each edge has a weight associated with it. 
> 	- Weight can be distance, cost, etc.
> - The shortest path **minimises the sum of the edge weights along the path**.

>    - A -> B -> E -> G = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8
>   - **A -> C -> E -> G = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4**
>   - A -> C -> F -> G = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7


> [!consider] Real-World Applications
>
> Shortest path algorithms have numerous practical applications:
> 
> - **Navigation systems**: Finding the quickest route between locations.
> - **Network routing**: Determining efficient paths for data packets in computer networks.
> - **Robot motion planning**: Calculating optimal paths for robots to navigate environments.
> 
> In these scenarios, the graph represents the network or environment, vertices represent locations or nodes, and edge weights represent distances or costs. Finding the shortest path helps optimize routes, minimize travel time, or reduce resource consumption.

> [!idea] Properties of Shortest Paths
>
> **A segment of the shortest path between two nodes is itself the shortest path between any two nodes located within that segment.**
> 
> Mathematically, if the shortest path from node $s$ to node $v$ passes through an intermediate node $u$, then:
> - The portion of the path from s to u is the shortest path from s to u.
> - The portion of the path from u to v is the shortest path from u to v.
> 
> This property is crucial for understanding and developing shortest path algorithms. It allows algorithms to build shortest paths incrementally by extending known shortest paths.

> In the image, if the shortest path from s to v is s → a → b → v, then:
> - The subpath s → a → b is the shortest path from s to b.
> - The subpath a → b → v is the shortest path from a to v.
>
> The subpath property ensures that the shortest path from s to v can be constructed by combining the shortest paths from s to b and from a to v.
