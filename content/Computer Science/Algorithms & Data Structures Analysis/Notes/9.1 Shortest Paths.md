> - **Navigation systems**: Finding the quickest route between locations.
> - **Network routing**: Determining efficient paths for data packets in computer networks.
> - **Robot motion planning**: Calculating optimal paths for robots to navigate environments.

> In these scenarios, the graph represents the network or environment, vertices represent locations or nodes, and edge weights represent distances or costs. Finding the shortest path helps optimize routes, minimize travel time, or reduce resource consumption.

> [!idea] Properties of Shortest Paths

> **A segment of the shortest path between two nodes is itself the shortest path between any two nodes located within that segment.**
>
> Mathematically, if the shortest path from node $s$ to node $v$ passes through an intermediate node $u$, then:
> - The portion of the path from s to u is the shortest path from s to u.
> - The portion of the path from u to v is the shortest path from u to v.
>
> This property is crucial for understanding and developing shortest path algorithms. It allows algorithms to build shortest paths incrementally by extending known shortest paths.

> In the image, if the shortest path from s to v is s → a → b → v, then:
> - The subpath s → a → b is the shortest path from s to b.
> - The subpath a → b → v is the shortest path from a to v.
>
> The subpath property ensures that the shortest path from s to v can be constructed by combining the shortest paths from s to b and from a to v.
>
> [!consider] Non-Negative Edge Costs
>
> Many shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, assume that all edge weights in the graph are non-negative. This means that the weight of each edge is greater than or equal to zero.
>
> In mathematical terms:
> - For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the weight w(u, v) ≥ 0.
>
> The assumption of non-negative edge weights simplifies the problem and allows for more efficient algorithms. It ensures that as we explore the graph, the shortest path distances cannot decrease.

> [!consider] Negative Cycles and Shortest Path Algorithms
>
> Shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm, assume that there are no negative cycles in the graph. A negative cycle is a cycle in the graph where the sum of the edge weights along the cycle is negative.
>
> The presence of negative cycles can cause these algorithms to fail or produce incorrect results. Here's why:
>
> 1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
>    - Dijkstra's algorithm relies on the property that the shortest path from the source to any vertex always passes through vertices with non-decreasing shortest path estimates.
>    - If there is a negative cycle, the algorithm may keep updating the shortest path estimates of vertices in the cycle indefinitely, as each traversal of the cycle would decrease the estimate further.
>    - This leads to the algorithm getting stuck in an infinite loop and failing to terminate.
>
> 2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:**
>    - The Bellman-Ford algorithm can detect negative cycles by checking if the shortest path estimates continue to change after `|V| - 1` iterations, where `|V|` is the number of vertices.
>    - However, if there is a negative cycle reachable from the source vertex, the algorithm will report that there is no shortest path because the shortest path distance to vertices in the cycle can be arbitrarily small by repeatedly traversing the negative cycle.
>
> In the presence of negative cycles, the concept of the shortest path becomes ill-defined, as the path length can be made arbitrarily small by repeatedly traversing the negative cycle. Therefore, these algorithms are not applicable in such scenarios.
>
> To handle graphs with negative cycles, specialized algorithms like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to detect the presence of negative cycles and report them explicitly. Alternatively, the graph can be preprocessed to remove negative cycles before applying shortest path algorithms.
