For the image, you can create a simple graph with vertices s, a, b, and v, and edges connecting them to illustrate the subpath property. The image should clearly show that the shortest path from s to v passes through vertices a and b, and that the subpaths s → a → b and a → b → v are also shortest paths between their respective endpoints.
