> In mathematical terms: 
> - We have a graph $G$ with nodes $V$ and edges $E$. 
> - Each edge has a weight associated with it.

> [!consider] Real-World Applications

> Shortest path algorithms have numerous practical applications:
> 
> - **Navigation systems**: Finding the quickest route between locations.
> - **Network routing**: Determining efficient paths for data packets in computer networks.
> - **Robot motion planning**: Calculating optimal paths for robots to navigate environments.
> 
> In these scenarios, the graph represents the network or environment, vertices represent locations or nodes, and edge weights represent distances or costs. Finding the shortest path helps optimize routes, minimize travel time, or reduce resource consumption.

> [!idea] Properties of Shortest Paths
>
> **A segment of the shortest path between two nodes is itself the shortest path between any two nodes located within that segment.**
> 
> Mathematically, if the shortest path from node $s$ to node $v$ passes through an intermediate node $u$, then:
> - The portion of the path from s to u is the shortest path from s to u.
> - The portion of the path from u to v is the shortest path from u to v.
> 
> This property is crucial for understanding and developing shortest path algorithms. It allows algorithms to build shortest paths incrementally by extending known shortest paths.

> [!example] Subpath Property Illustration
>
> ![[Subpaths.png|500]]
>
> In the image, if the shortest path from s to v is s → a → b → v, then:
> - The subpath s → a → b is the shortest path from s to b.
> - The subpath a → b → v is the shortest path from a to v.
>
> The subpath property ensures that the shortest path from s to v can be constructed by combining the shortest paths from s to b and from a to v.


> [!consider] Non-Negative Edge Costs
>
> Many shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, assume that all edge weights in the graph are non-negative. This means that the weight of each edge is greater than or equal to zero.
>
> In mathematical terms:
> - For every edge (u, v) in the graph, the weight w(u, v) ≥ 0.
>
> The assumption of non-negative edge weights simplifies the problem and allows for more efficient algorithms. It ensures that as we explore the graph, the shortest path distances cannot decrease.
