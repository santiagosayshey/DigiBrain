Motivation: To introduce the concept of shortest paths and their real-world applications.

> [!idea] Shortest Paths
> 
> Given a starting node, the goal is to **determine the shortest path to reach any other vertex**.
> 
> In mathematical terms: 
> - We have a graph $G$ with nodes $V$ and edges $E$. 
> - Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it. The shortest path from a starting node $s$ to any other node $v$ is the path that minimizes the sum of the edge weights along the path.

Motivation: To highlight the practical applications of shortest path algorithms and their importance in various domains.

> [!consider] Real-World Applications
>
> Shortest path algorithms have numerous practical applications:
> 
> - **Navigation systems**: Finding the quickest route between locations.
> - **Network routing**: Determining efficient paths for data packets in computer networks.
> - **Robot motion planning**: Calculating optimal paths for robots to navigate environments.
> 
> In these scenarios, the graph represents the network or environment, vertices represent locations or nodes, and edge weights represent distances or costs. Finding the shortest path helps optimize routes, minimize travel time, or reduce resource consumption.

Motivation: To introduce the properties of shortest paths, focusing on the subpath property, which is essential for understanding and developing shortest path algorithms.

> [!idea] Properties of Shortest Paths
>
> Shortest paths have an important property known as the subpath property: any subpath of a shortest path is also a shortest path between its endpoints.
> 
> Mathematically, if the shortest path from vertex s to vertex v passes through an intermediate vertex u, then:
> - The portion of the path from s to u is the shortest path from s to u.
> - The portion of the path from u to v is the shortest path from u to v.
> 
> This property is crucial for understanding and developing shortest path algorithms. It allows algorithms to build shortest paths incrementally by extending known shortest paths.

Motivation: To visually illustrate the subpath property and reinforce the concept.

> In the image, if the shortest path from s to v is s → a → b → v, then:
> - The subpath s → a → b is the shortest path from s to b.
> - The subpath a → b → v is the shortest path from a to v.
>
> The subpath property ensures that the shortest path from s to v can be constructed by combining the shortest paths from s to b and from a to v.

By providing motivations and explanations using simple language and mathematical terms, the concepts become more accessible and easier to understand. The focus is on conveying the key ideas and properties of shortest paths without diving into rigorous mathematical definitions.
