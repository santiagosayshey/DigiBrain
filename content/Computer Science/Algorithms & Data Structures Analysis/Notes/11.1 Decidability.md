> [!motivation] Significance of Decidability
>
> Determining whether a computational problem is decidable  has profound implications for understanding the capabilities and limitations of computational systems. It allows us to:
>
> 1. Identify problems that can be solved algorithmically, guiding resource allocation towards developing efficient solutions.
> 2. Recognize inherently unsolvable problems, preventing futile efforts in seeking algorithmic solutions.
> 3. Explore the fundamental boundaries of computability, advancing our theoretical understanding of what is computable.

> [!example] Decidability of Printing "Hello World"
>
> Let's consider the problem of determining if a given program can print the string "Hello World":
>
> **Simple Case:**
> ```python
> print("Hello World")
> ```
> This program is decidable since we can easily analyze the code and conclude that it will definitely print "Hello World".
>
> **Complex Case:**
> ```python
> def print_hello_world():
>     n = 3
>     while True:
>         for a in range(1, n+1):
>             for b in range(1, n+1):
>                 for c in range(1, n+1):
>                     if a**n + b**n == c**n:
>                         print("Hello World")
>                         return
>         n += 1
>
> print_hello_world()
> ```
> This program attempts to find a counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem by iterating through all possible values of n, a, b, and c to find integers satisfying a^n + b^n = c^n for n > 2. If such a counterexample exists, it would print "Hello World".
>
> However, since Fermat's Last Theorem has been proven true for all n > 2, the program will run indefinitely without printing "Hello World" for inputs where n > 2.
>
> In this case, determining if the program can print "Hello World" becomes an undecidable problem. No algorithm can provide a definite answer for inputs where n > 2, as the program will never terminate or print the desired string.
>
> This example highlights how the decidability of a problem can depend on the specific program implementation and the presence of undecidable components or infinite loops within the code.
