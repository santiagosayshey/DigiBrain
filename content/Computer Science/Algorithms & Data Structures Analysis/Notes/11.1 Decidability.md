> [!motivation] Significance of Decidability
>
> Determining whether a computational problem is decidable  has profound implications for understanding the capabilities and limitations of computational systems. It allows us to:
>
> 1. Identify problems that can be solved algorithmically, guiding resource allocation towards developing efficient solutions.
> 2. Recognize inherently unsolvable problems, preventing futile efforts in seeking algorithmic solutions.
> 3. Explore the fundamental boundaries of computability, advancing our theoretical understanding of what is computable.

> [!idea] Decidable and Undecidable Decision Problems
>
> A decision problem is a **type of computational problem with a binary (yes/no) answer**. Decision problems are classified as either decidable or undecidable:
>
> **Decidable decision problems have an algorithm that can provide a definite yes or no** answer in finite time for any valid input instance. Examples include determining if a string is a palindrome or checking if a number is prime.
>
> **Undecidable decision problems are those for which no algorithm can exist** that can solve the problem for all possible inputs. For some inputs, no computational solution can provide a definite answer. The Halting Problem and determining program equivalence are well-known undecidable problems.

> [!example] Illustrative Examples
>
> **Decidable Problems:**
> - Checking if a given string is a palindrome (e.g., "racecar")
> - Testing if a number is prime (e.g., 7, 11, 13)
> - Verifying if a context-free grammar generates a specific string
>
> **Undecidable Problems:**
> - The Halting Problem: Determining if a given program will halt (finish executing) or run forever on a specific input
> - Deciding if two arbitrary programs compute the same function for all possible inputs
> - Checking if an arbitrary Turing machine will accept or reject a given input string
