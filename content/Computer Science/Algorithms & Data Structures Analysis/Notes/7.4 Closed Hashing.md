> [!idea] Closed Hashing - Probing
>
> In closed hashing, when a collision occurs, **probing** is used to find an alternative empty slot in the array. ⊥ is used to indicate empty slots that values can be placed in.
> - Common probing techniques include:
>   - Linear Probing: Incrementally search for the next empty slot.
>   - Quadratic Probing: Use quadratic function to determine the next slot.
>   - Double Hashing: Use a secondary hash function to calculate the step size for probing.

>**Insertion in Linear Probing:**
>- Start at the initial index obtained by applying the hash function.
>- If the slot is occupied, increment the the next available slot and place the key there.

When deleting a key-value pair in a hash table using linear probing, the process involves shifting elements to maintain the integrity of the probing sequence. Here's how the deletion process works:
>1. Get the index `i` by applying the hash function `h` to the key `k`.
>2. If the slot at index `i` is empty (denoted by `⊥`), the key is not present in the hash table, so we return.
>3. If the element `e` at index `i` has a key different from `k`, we linearly probe to the next slot by incrementing `i` by 1 and go back to step 2.
>4. If the key at index `i` matches `k`, we have found the key-value pair to be deleted. We set the slot at index `i` to `⊥` to mark it as empty.
>5. We set the index `j` to `i+1` to start shifting elements.
>6. If the slot at index `j` is empty (`⊥`), we have finished shifting and can return.
>7. If the hash value of the element at index `j` is greater than `i`, it means the element at `j` was not probed to its current position and should not be shifted. We increment `j` by 1 and go back to step 6.
>8. If the hash value of the element at index `j` is less than or equal to `i`, it means the element at `j` was probed to its current position and needs to be shifted. We move the element from index `j` to index `i` and set the slot at index `j` to `⊥`.
>9. We update the index `i` to `j` and go back to step 5 to continue shifting elements.
