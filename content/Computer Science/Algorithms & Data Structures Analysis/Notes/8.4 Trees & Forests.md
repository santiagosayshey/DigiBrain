> - A **tree** is a connected undirected graph with no cycles.
>   - In a tree, there exists **a unique path between any pair of nodes**.
>   - A tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges.
>   - Trees have a hierarchical structure and are often used to represent hierarchical relationships or dependencies.
>
> - A **forest** is a disjoint union of trees.
>   - In other words, a forest is an undirected graph where each subgraph is a tree. There **may exist a unique path between any pair of nodes.**
>   - There are no cycles in a forest, and there may be multiple disconnected subgraphs.
