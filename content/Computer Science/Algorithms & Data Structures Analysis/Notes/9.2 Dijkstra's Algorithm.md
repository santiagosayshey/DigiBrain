> Dijkstra's algorithm is a way to **find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph**, where each edge has a non-negative weight. The algorithm **keeps track of the distances from the starting node to each node in the graph** and updates these distances as it progresses.
>
> Here's how the algorithm works:
> 1. Maintain two sets - visited nodes and unvisited nodes.
>
> 2. Choose a starting node and mark it as visited. Consider the distance from the starting node to itself as 0 and the distances to all other nodes as infinity.
>
> 3. Look at the edges coming out of the starting node. Update the distances to the nodes connected by these edges. If there's no edge between the starting node and a particular node, the distance remains infinity.
>
> 4. For each node updated in step 3, record the starting node as its predecessor.
>
> 5. Pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the starting node and mark it as visited.
>
> 6. Update the distances to the other nodes by considering the edges coming out of the newly visited node. If the distance to a node through the newly visited node is smaller than the current distance, update the distance and set the newly visited node as the predecessor for these nodes.
>
> 7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until all nodes are visited or the destination node is reached.
>
> 8. To reconstruct the shortest path to any node, trace back from the node to the starting node using the predecessors recorded.

> In the example above, we start at node 0. We mark 0 as visited and update the distances to its neighbours 1 and 2. Then, we pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance (2) and mark it as visited. We update the distances to B's neighbours (1, 3 and 4). We continue this process until all nodes are visited.

> By repeatedly selecting the unvisited node with the smallest distance and updating the distances based on the edges, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

> - Using a binary heap: O((V + E) log V)
>   - Inserting and extracting nodes from the priority queue takes O(log V) time.
>   - In the worst case, we may insert and extract all nodes, resulting in O(V log V) time.
>   - We also process each edge once, which takes O(E) time.
>
> - Using a Fibonacci heap: O(V log V + E)
>   - Inserting nodes into the priority queue takes O(1) amortized time.
>   - Extracting nodes takes O(log V) amortized time.
>   - Processing edges takes O(E) time.

> Here, V represents the number of nodes (vertices) and E represents the number of edges in the graph.
