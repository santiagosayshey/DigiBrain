> Similarly, Dijkstra's algorithm starts from the starting node and expands the shortest path tree incrementally. It explores the graph by visiting the node with the shortest distance from the starting node and updating the distances of its neighbors. This process continues until all nodes are visited or the desired destination is reached.

> 1. Initialize distances:

>    - Set the distances of all other nodes to infinity.

> 2. Create a priority queue to store nodes based on their distances.

>    - For each unvisited neighbor of the current node:
>      - Calculate the tentative distance to the neighbor through the current node.
>      - If the tentative distance is smaller than the current distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.

> 4. Once the priority queue is empty, the shortest paths from the starting node to all other nodes have been found.
