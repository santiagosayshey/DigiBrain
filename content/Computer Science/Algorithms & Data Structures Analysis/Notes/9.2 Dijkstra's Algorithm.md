> Dijkstra's algorithm is a way to **find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph**, where each edge has a non-negative weight. The algorithm **keeps track of the distances from the starting node to each node in the graph** and updates these distances as it progresses.
>
> Here's how the algorithm works:
> 1. Maintain two sets - visited nodes and unvisited nodes.
>
> 2. Choose a starting node and mark it as visited. Consider the distance from the starting node to itself as 0 and the distances to all other nodes as infinity.
>
> 3. Look at the edges coming out of the starting node. Update the distances to the nodes connected by these edges. If there's no edge between the starting node and a particular node, the distance remains infinity.
>
> 4. For each node updated in step 3, record the starting node as its predecessor.
>
> 5. Pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the starting node and mark it as visited.
>
> 6. Update the distances to the other nodes by considering the edges coming out of the newly visited node. If the distance to a node through the newly visited node is smaller than the current distance, update the distance and set the newly visited node as the predecessor for these nodes.
>
> 7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 until all nodes are visited or the destination node is reached.
>
> 8. To reconstruct the shortest path to any node, trace back from the node to the starting node using the predecessors recorded.

> In the example above, we start at node 0. We mark 0 as visited and update the distances to its neighbours 1 and 2. Then, we pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance (2) and mark it as visited. We update the distances to B's neighbours (1, 3 and 4). We continue this process until all nodes are visited.

> By repeatedly selecting the unvisited node with the smallest distance and updating the distances based on the edges, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest paths from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.


> [!consider] **Using a Priority Queue in Dijkstra's Algorithm**
>
> **Queues** are a type of data structure where elements are added (enqueued) at the back and removed (dequeued) from the front, following a First In, First Out (FIFO) order. A **priority queue** differs by allowing elements to be processed according to their priority instead of the order they were added. Specifically, in Dijkstra’s algorithm, a priority queue is typically implemented as a **min-heap**. This structure ensures that the element with the highest priority (in this case, the smallest distance) is always at the front, allowing for efficient access and removal.
>
> 1. **Initialize the Priority Queue:** Enqueue the starting node with a distance of zero into the priority queue. All other nodes are enqueued with a distance of infinity.
>
> 2. **Process the Queue:** Efficiently dequeue the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue for processing.
>
> 3. **Update Distances:** If a neighboring node can be reached more quickly via the current node, update its distance. If this new distance is shorter, adjust its position in the priority queue to reflect the updated priority. This adjustment may involve re-enqueuing the node with its new, shorter distance.
>
> 4. **Mark as Visited:** After a node is dequeued and processed, mark it as visited to prevent reprocessing.
>
> 5. **Repeat:** Continue this process until the priority queue is empty.
>
> 6. **Path Reconstruction:** Follow the recorded predecessors to trace the shortest path from the start node to any other.
>
> **Example:**
> - Nodes `A`, `B`, and `C` are interconnected. Starting at `A`, enqueue it with a distance of `0`. `B` and `C` start with infinity.
> - Dequeue `A` and update the distances for `B` (1) and `C` (4). Enqueue `B` and `C` with these new distances.
> - Dequeue `B`, update `C`'s distance to `3` via `B`. If this new distance of `3` is shorter than the previous distance of `4`, re-enqueue `C` with the updated distance.
> - Finally, dequeue `C`.
>
> This utilization of a priority queue implemented as a min-heap optimizes Dijkstra's algorithm, ensuring it processes nodes in an order that rapidly advances towards the shortest path solutions, especially beneficial in graphs with numerous nodes or extensive connectivity.

> Here, V represents the number of nodes (vertices) and E represents the number of edges in the graph.
