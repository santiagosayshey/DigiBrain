>
> Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that **finds a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** for a connected, undirected, and weighted graph. It operates by **iteratively building the MST**, starting from an arbitrary vertex and **adding the shortest possible edge at each step** that connects a new vertex to the growing tree.
>
> The algorithm follows these steps:
>
> 1. Initialize an empty set `visited` to keep track of visited vertices, and an empty set `mst` to store the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree.
> 2. Choose an arbitrary starting vertex `A` and add it to `visited`.
> 3. Examine every node reachable from nodes inside `visited` and choose the smallest edge. Add the node that connects from this edge to `visited`, and add the edge to the `mst` set.
>    - If the smallest edge connects two nodes that have already been visited, we discard this edge.
> 4. Repeat this process until all nodes have been reached. The `mst` set will now contain all the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree.

>     mst = []
>     pq = priorityQueue()

> 3. Initialize a priority queue `pq` to store the edges, ordered by their weights.
> 4. Add the starting vertex `s` to `visited`.

>     2. Add `v` to `visited`.
>     3. Add `(u, v)` to `mst`.
>     4. Add all the edges incident on `v` (that are not already in `pq`) to `pq`.
> 7. Return `mst`.

> [!consider] The Cut Property at Work
>
> The key insight that makes Prim's Algorithm work is the cut property. At **each step, the algorithm separates the graph into two disjoint sets - the visited nodes and the unvisited nodes**. This separation forms a "cut" across the graph. 
>
> The cut property states that for any such cut in a connected, weighted graph, at least one of the minimum-weight edges crossing the cut must be part of the Minimum Spanning Tree.
>
> By **always choosing the minimum-weight edge that crosses the cut** between visited and unvisited nodes, Prim's Algorithm is essentially leveraging the cut property to grow the Minimum Spanning Tree one edge at a time. This greedy approach, guided by the cut property, is what enables the algorithm to correctly construct the MST.

> [!consider] Time Complexity Analysis
>
> Let's analyze the time complexity of Prim's Algorithm and the priority queue data structure used in the algorithm.
>
> **Prim's Algorithm:**
> - The main loop of Prim's Algorithm iterates over the edges in the priority queue. In the worst case, it processes all edges in the graph, which takes $O(E)$ time, where $E$ is the number of edges.
> - For each processed edge, the following operations are performed:
>   - Extracting the minimum-weight edge from the priority queue takes $O(\log V)$ time, where $V$ is the number of vertices, assuming an efficient priority queue implementation like a binary heap or Fibonacci heap.
>   - Checking if the vertices are in the same connected component takes $O(\alpha(V))$ time using a union-find data structure, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
>   - Adding edges to the priority queue takes $O(\log V)$ time per edge.
> - Therefore, the overall time complexity of Prim's Algorithm is $O((E + V) \log V)$ when using a binary heap for the priority queue and union-find for connected component tracking. This can be further optimized to $O(E \log V)$ using a Fibonacci heap for the priority queue.


> [!consider] Comparison with Kruskal's Algorithm
>
> Both Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm are greedy algorithms used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, and weighted graph. However, they differ in their approaches and underlying data structures:
>
> **Kruskal's Algorithm:**
>
> - Processes edges in increasing order of their weights.
> - Starts with an empty set and adds edges that do not create cycles, using a union-find data structure to detect cycles.
> - Time complexity: $O(E \\log E)$, where $E$ is the number of edges, due to sorting and union-find operations.
>
> **Prim's Algorithm:**
>
> - Grows a single tree from a starting vertex by adding the shortest possible edge that connects a new vertex to the growing tree.
> - Uses a priority queue to efficiently find the minimum-weight edge at each step.
> - Time complexity: $O((E + V) \\log V)$ or $O(E \\log V)$ when using a Fibonacci heap, where $V$ is the number of vertices.
>
> In terms of efficiency, Prim's Algorithm is generally more suitable for dense graphs, where $E$ is close to $V^2$, as its time complexity becomes $O(V^2 \\log V)$. Kruskal's Algorithm is typically more efficient for sparse graphs, where $E$ is much smaller than $V^2$, with a time complexity of $O(E \\log E)$.
