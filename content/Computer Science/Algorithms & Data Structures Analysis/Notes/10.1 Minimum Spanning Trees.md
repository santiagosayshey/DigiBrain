> [!consider] Motivation
>
> In many real-world scenarios, we need to connect a set of points or nodes in a way that **minimises the total cost or weight of the connections**. For example:
>
> - **Computer Networks**: Connect devices (routers, switches, etc.) with minimal cabling or infrastructure cost.
> - **Transportation Networks**: Build roads or railways to connect cities or locations with minimal construction cost.
> - **Utility Networks**: Connect households or facilities to water, electricity, or communication services with minimal resource usage.
>
> In these situations, we want to ensure that all points or nodes are connected (forming a single component), while minimizing the overall cost or weight of the connections. This leads us to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem.

> [!idea] Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Problem
>
> Given a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with positive edge costs/weights, find a subset of edges $E' \in E$ that forms a tree $T = (V, E')$ such that:
>
> 1. $T$ includes all vertices $V$ from the original graph $G$.
> 2. $T$ is a tree, meaning it is a connected graph with no cycles.
> 3. The total cost/weight of the edges in $E'$ is minimized among all possible spanning trees of $G$.

> [!example] Real-World Example
>
> Consider a computer network where nodes represent computers, and edges represent possible connections between them. The costs/weights on the edges represent the cost of establishing those connections. The goal is to connect all computers while minimizing the total cost of the network infrastructure.

> [!consider] Properties and Considerations
>
> - **Cut Property:** An edge of minimum cost/weight in any cut (a set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph) belongs to some MST. This property is crucial for greedy algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's.
> - **Cycle Property:** An edge of maximum cost/weight in any cycle is not part of any MST. This property helps prune unnecessary edges during the MST construction.
> - **No Cycles:** Since edge costs are positive, the subgraph of minimum cost must be a tree (no cycles). If cycles were allowed, removing the maximum-cost edge from the cycle would yield a lower-cost subgraph.
> - **Applications:** MSTs are widely used in network design, circuit design, clustering, approximation algorithms, and more. Finding an efficient and low-cost way to connect a set of points/nodes is a fundamental problem in many domains.

> [!idea] Kruskal's Algorithm
>
> Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy approach to find the MST of a given graph. It works by sorting the edges in ascending order of their costs/weights and iteratively adding edges that do not form a cycle to the growing MST.

> Sorted edges: [(1, 2, 1), (2, 4, 2), (1, 3, 3), (3, 4, 3), (2, 3, 4), (1, 5, 5), (4, 5, 7)]
>
> 1. Start with an empty MST.
> 2. Add the edge (1, 2, 1) to the MST.
> 3. Add the edge (2, 4, 2) to the MST.
> 4. Skip the edge (1, 3, 3) as it forms a cycle.
> 5. Add the edge (3, 4, 3) to the MST.
> 6. Skip the edge (2, 3, 4) as it forms a cycle.
> 7. Add the edge (1, 5, 5) to the MST.
> 8. Skip the edge (4, 5, 7) as it forms a cycle.
>
> The resulting MST has a total cost of 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations for Kruskal's Algorithm
>
> - **Time Complexity:** Kruskal's algorithm has a time complexity of O(m log m), where m is the number of edges. This is due to the sorting step, which takes O(m log m) time using a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
> - **Union-Find Data Structure:** To efficiently detect cycles during the algorithm's execution, Kruskal's algorithm uses a Union-Find data structure. This data structure supports efficient `FIND` and `UNION` operations, which are used to determine if adding an edge would create a cycle.
> - **Implementation Details:** The Union-Find data structure can be implemented using various techniques, such as a list-oriented approach or a tree-based approach. The choice of implementation can affect the overall time complexity and performance of the algorithm.

> [!idea] Prim's Algorithm (JarnÃ­k's Algorithm)
>
> Prim's algorithm is another greedy approach to find the MST of a given graph. It starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the MST by iteratively adding the minimum-cost edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.

> [!example] Prim's Algorithm Example

> Given the following graph:
>
> ```
>      4
>   1 --- 9
>   |     |
>   3     2
>   |     |
>   6 --- 5 --- 7
>       2
> ```
>
> 1. Start with an arbitrary vertex, say 1, and initialize the MST with vertex 1.
> 2. Add the minimum-cost edge (1, 3, 3) to the MST, connecting vertex 3.
> 3. Add the minimum-cost edge (3, 6, 6) to the MST, connecting vertex 6.
> 4. Add the minimum-cost edge (6, 5, 2) to the MST, connecting vertex 5.
> 5. Add the minimum-cost edge (5, 2, 2) to the MST, connecting vertex 2.
> 6. Add the minimum-cost edge (2, 4, 1) to the MST, connecting vertex 4.
> 7. Add the minimum-cost edge (4, 9, 4) to the MST, connecting vertex 9.
>
> The resulting MST has a total cost of 3 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 18.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations for Prim's Algorithm
>
> - **Time Complexity:** Prim's algorithm has a time complexity of O((m + n) log n), where m is the number of edges, and n is the number of vertices. This is due to the use of a priority queue data structure to efficiently find the minimum-cost edge at each step.
> - **Priority Queue Implementation:** The choice of priority queue implementation, such as a binary heap or a Fibonacci heap, can impact the overall time complexity and performance of the algorithm.
> - **Comparison with Kruskal's Algorithm:** Prim's algorithm is generally more efficient than Kruskal's algorithm for dense graphs, where the number of edges (m) is close to n^2. For sparse graphs, Kruskal's algorithm may be more efficient.

> [!consider] General Considerations for MSTs
>
> - **Parallel Algorithms:** Both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms can be parallelized to take advantage of multi-core or distributed computing environments, potentially improving their performance for large graphs.
> - **Approximation Algorithms:** In some cases, finding an exact MST may be computationally expensive or infeasible. Approximation algorithms can be used to find near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time.
> - **Dynamic Graphs:** In scenarios where the graph structure or edge costs/weights change over time, incremental algorithms or dynamic data structures may be needed to efficiently update the MST.
> - **Variations:** There are variations of the MST problem, such as the Euclidean MST problem, where the edge costs are Euclidean distances between points in a plane or higher-dimensional space. These variations may require specialized algorithms or techniques.

By considering these various aspects, we can better understand the strengths, limitations, and potential applications of minimum spanning tree algorithms in different contexts.
