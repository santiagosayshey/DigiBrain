> Order statistics tell us the position of an element in a set relative to other elements. The $i'th$ order statistic in a set of $n$ elements is the $i'th$ smallest element.
> - The minimum element is the $1st$ order statistic
> - The maximum element is the $n'th$ order statistic
> - The median is the $n/2'th$ order statistic. If n is even, there are 2 medians

> [!consider] Minimum and Maximum Time Complexity

> - How many comparisons are needed to find the minimum element in a set? The maximum? We need $n-1$ comparisons at $O(n)$ in the worst case
> - Can we simultaneously find the minimum and maximum with less than twice the cost?
> - Yes:
>   - Walk through elements by pairs
>     - Compare each element in pair to the other
>     - Compare the largest to maximum, smallest to minimum
>   - Total cost: 3 comparisons per 2 elements = $O(\frac{3n}{2})$
