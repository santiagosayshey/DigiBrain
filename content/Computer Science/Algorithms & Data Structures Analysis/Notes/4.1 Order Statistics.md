> Order statistics tell us the position of an element in a set relative to other elements. The $i'th$ order statistic in a set of $n$ elements is the $i'th$ smallest element.
> - The minimum element is the $1st$ order statistic
> - The maximum element is the $n'th$ order statistic
> - The median is the $n/2'th$ order statistic. If n is even, there are 2 medians
