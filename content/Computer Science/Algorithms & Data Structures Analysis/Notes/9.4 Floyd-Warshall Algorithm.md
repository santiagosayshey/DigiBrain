> The All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem aims to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. In other words, for every pair of vertices $(i, j)$ in the graph, we want to find the shortest path from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.
>
> The APSP problem has several important applications, such as:
> - Finding the shortest routes between all locations in a transportation network
> - Analyzing social networks to determine the shortest connections between individuals
> - Identifying the most efficient paths for data flow in computer networks
>
> There are various algorithms to solve the APSP problem, including:
> - Running Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm for each vertex as the source
> - **Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which uses dynamic programming to solve APSP**
> - Johnson's algorithm, which combines Dijkstra's algorithm with the Bellman-Ford algorithm
>
> The choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the graph's structure, the presence of negative edge weights, and the desired time complexity.

> [!idea] Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
>
> The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an [All-Pairs Shortest Path algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It is an example of [[Dynamic Programming|dynamic programming]], where the shortest path problem is solved by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
>
> The key idea behind the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is to gradually **build up the solution by considering the intermediate vertices in the paths**. It starts by considering paths that use no intermediate vertices, then paths that use vertex 1 as an intermediate, then paths that use vertex 2 and so on, until all vertices have been considered as intermediates.
>
> The algorithm maintains a distance matrix that stores the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices. It iteratively updates the distance matrix by considering the effect of including each vertex as an intermediate node in the paths.
>
> The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can handle graphs with negative edge weights but not negative cycles. If a negative cycle is present, the algorithm will detect it and report that no solution exists.

> [!consider] Intermediates
> When we say "intermediate" vertices, we mean the vertices that are allowed to be used as part of the path between two other vertices. For example, when we consider vertex A as an intermediate, we update the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices by checking if going through vertex A results in a shorter path.
>
> Let's consider a small example to illustrate this concept. Suppose we have vertices B and C, and the current shortest path distance from B to C is 10. Now, when we consider vertex A as an intermediate, we check if the path B → A → C is shorter than the current shortest path distance of 10. If the sum of the distances B → A and A → C is less than 10, we update the shortest path distance from B to C to this new value.

> The Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a time complexity of $O(V^3)$, where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph.
>
> The algorithm uses three nested loops, each iterating over the vertices of the graph. In each iteration, it performs a constant number of operations to update the distance matrix. Therefore, the total number of operations is proportional to $V^3$.
> 
> The space complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is $O(V^2)$ since it uses a distance matrix of size $V \times V$ to store the shortest path distances between all pairs of vertices.

> Here's the pseudocode for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm:

```python
function FloydWarshall(graph):
    n = number of vertices in graph
    dist = n x n matrix initialized with infinity
    
    # Initialize the distance matrix
    for each edge (u, v) with weight w in graph:
        dist[u][v] = w
    
    for each vertex v in graph:
        dist[v][v] = 0
    
    # Update the distance matrix considering each vertex as intermediate
    for k from 1 to n:
        # Consider vertex k as an intermediate
        for i from 1 to n:
            for j from 1 to n:
                # If the path from i to j through k is shorter than the current shortest path,
                # update the shortest path distance
                if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
    
    return dist
