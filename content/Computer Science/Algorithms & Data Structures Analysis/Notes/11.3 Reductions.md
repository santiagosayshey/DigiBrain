> Reductions are **used to prove non-computability by leveraging known foundational non-computable problems**.
> 
> - **Concept**: If problem A is known to be undecidable and we can show that solving problem B would allow us to solve problem A, then problem B is also undecidable.
> - **Foundation**: The process relies on foundational non-computable problems, such as the Halting Problem, which have been directly proven to be undecidable without reductions.
