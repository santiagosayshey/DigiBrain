> [!idea] Recurrence Relations
> 
> Recurrence relations are mathematical equations that describe the running time or space complexity of recursive algorithms by expressing the performance of the algorithm in terms of its input size. They offer a structured way to analyze and predict the efficiency of recursive algorithms as the size of the input data changes.
> 
> Recurrence relations are useful for understanding and analyzing various types of recursive algorithms, including those that break down a problem into smaller subproblems, solve these subproblems recursively, and then combine the solutions to solve the original problem (e.g., divide and conquer algorithms). They are also applicable to other recursive paradigms such as decrease and conquer, dynamic programming, and backtracking.

> This recurrence relation states that the nth Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers, plus some work (+1) to combine them, with the base cases of $F(0) = 0$ and $F(1) = 1$.

>     }
>     else
>     {
>         return n * factorial(n - 1);

> This recurrence relation states that the factorial of $n$ (denoted as $n!$) is equal to $n$ multiplied by the factorial of $(n-1)$ plus some work to combine them (+1), with the base case of $F(0) = 1$.

> [!idea]+ Solving Recurrence Relations
> 
> There are many ways to solve recurrence relations, including:
> 
> 1. Plugging and chugging (iteration)
>    - This method involves iteratively expanding the recurrence relation by substituting the formula back into itself until a pattern emerges.
> 
> 2. Substitution and proof by induction
>    - In this approach, you guess a solution for the recurrence relation and then prove its correctness using mathematical induction.
> 
> 3. Recursive tree method
>    - This technique involves drawing a tree that represents the recursive calls and their associated costs. By summing up the costs at each level of the tree, you can determine the overall time complexity.
> 
> 4. Master theorem
>    - The master theorem provides a formula for solving certain types of divide-and-conquer recurrences. It allows you to quickly determine the time complexity of a recursive algorithm based on its structure.
> 
> 5. Akra-Bazzi method
>    - The Akra-Bazzi method is a generalization of the master theorem and can be used to solve a wider range of divide-and-conquer recurrences. It provides a formula for solving recurrences of the form:
>      $$T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i T(\frac{n}{b_i}) + f(n)$$
>      where $a_i > 0$, $b_i > 1$, and $f(n)$ is a positive function.
