> [!idea] Graph Operations and Storage
>
> Working with graphs computationally involves a variety of operations that require efficient execution for practical use. It is essential to select an appropriate data structure that allows for the following operations:
>
> - **Accessing associated information**: Retrieve data associated with specific nodes and edges.
> - **Navigation**: Explore the graph by following edges from one node to another.
> - **Edge queries**: Determine if a connection exists between two nodes.
> - **Construction, conversion, and output**: Build new graphs, transform one graph representation into another, and output graph data.
> - **Update**: Add or remove nodes and edges to reflect changes in the graph.
>
> Different storage structures offer various trade-offs in terms of memory usage and the efficiency of operations. Choosing the right one depends on the specific needs of the application and the nature of the graph.


> [!consider] Linked List Representation
>
> This structure involves storing edges in an unordered sequence, such as a linked list. While it's suitable for simply outputting the edges of a graph, most operations, like checking the existence of an edge, require $O(m)$ time, where $m$ is the number of edges.
>
> **Example**:
>
> Consider the directed graph $G = (V, E)$ from the previous example:
>
> - $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$
> - $E = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 4)\}$
>
> Here's how the graph might be represented using a linked list:
>
> $$
> \begin{array}{ccccccc}
> \text{[Head]} & \rightarrow & (1, 2) & \rightarrow & (2, 3) & \rightarrow & (3, 1) & \rightarrow & (3, 4) & \rightarrow & (4, 4) & \rightarrow & \text{[Tail]}
> \end{array}
> $$
>
> In this representation:
>
> - Each edge is stored as a node in the linked list.
> - The nodes are connected in an arbitrary order.
> - To output the edges of the graph, we can traverse the linked list and print each edge.
> - However, operations like checking if an edge exists between two vertices would require traversing the entire list, resulting in $O(m)$ time complexity.
>
> While the linked list representation is simple to implement, it may not be the most efficient for certain graph operations. Alternative representations, such as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list, can provide better performance for specific tasks.



> [!consider]  Adjacency Arrays (Static Graphs Only)
>
> The adjacency array organizes the edges of a static graph using two main components, which we can represent as follows:
>
> - The **Vertex Array (V)** serves as a guide, indicating the starting point for each vertex's edges in the Edge Array. 
> $$
> V = \begin{bmatrix}
> 1 & 3 & \ldots
> \end{bmatrix}
> $$
> In this array, the number at each position tells us where the edges for that vertex start in the Edge Array. For instance, if the first vertex's edges start at index 1 in the Edge Array, that's where we'll find it in  $E[1]$.
> 
>
> - The **Edge Array (E)** lists all the edges in the graph sequentially:
> $$
> E = \begin{bmatrix}
> 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & \ldots
> \end{bmatrix}
> $$
> Here, the edges are arranged one after another for each vertex. If vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 3, and vertex 2 to vertices 3 and 4, these edges are laid out in $E$ just as listed.
>
> Together, these arrays allow for efficient traversal and querying of the graph. However, keep in mind that inserting or deleting edges would necessitate adjustments throughout the Edge Array, which is why this structure is best suited for graphs that do not change often.
 

> [!idea] Adjacency Lists
>
> Adjacency lists store nodes inside a node array. Each element inside this array points to a linked list which contains the edges for that node.
>
> $$
> \begin{array}{c}
> \text{Node Array} \\
> \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
> \hline
> 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
> \hline
> \downarrow & \downarrow & \downarrow & \downarrow \\
> \end{array} \\
> \text{Linked Lists} \\
> \begin{array}{cccc}
> \begin{array}{|c|c|}
> \hline
> 2 & 3 \\
> \hline

> Advantages:
> - Edge insertion and deletion can be done in $O(1)$ time.
> - Memory usage is proportional to the number of edges, making it efficient for sparse graphs.
>
> Disadvantages:
> - Edge queries (checking if an edge exists) require traversing the linked lists, taking $O(n)$ time in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices.
> - Not as cache-friendly as adjacency matrices due to the non-contiguous memory layout of linked lists.
>
> Adjacency lists strike a balance between space efficiency and the ability to modify the graph structure dynamically, making them a popular choice for many graph algorithms.


> [!idea] Adjacency Matrices
>
> An adjacency matrix is a 2D array that represents a graph's connections. For a graph with $n$ vertices, the matrix has dimensions $n \times n$. The entry at row $i$ and column $j$ is 1 if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and 0 otherwise.
