> Consider a scenario of finding the $i'th$ [[Order Statistics|order statstic]] in a set. We know we can find this element in $O(n \cdot \log(n))$ time using a divide and conquer comparison sort. Can we do this faster?
> 
> Using a selection algorithm rather than a sorting algorithm, we can do this in linear time - $O(n)$. We do this by modifying the [[6.5 Quick Sort|Quick Sort]] algorithm, and worrying only about one of partitions on either side of the pivot.
