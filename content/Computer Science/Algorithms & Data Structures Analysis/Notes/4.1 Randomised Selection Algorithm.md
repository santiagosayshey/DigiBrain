> Consider a scenario of finding the $i'th$ [[Order Statistics]] in a set. We know we can find this element in $O(n \cdot \log(n))$ time using a divide and conquer comparison sort - [[6.4 Merge Sort]] or [[6.5 Quick Sort]]. Can we do this faster?

> Using a selection algorithm rather than a sorting algorithm, we can do this in linear time - $O(n)$
