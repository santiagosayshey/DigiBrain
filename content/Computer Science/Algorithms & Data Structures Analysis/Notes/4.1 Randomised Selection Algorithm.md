> Consider a scenario of finding the $i'th$ [[Order Statistics|order statstic]] in a set. We know we can find this element in $O(n \cdot \log(n))$ time using a divide and conquer comparison sort. Can we do this faster?
> 
> Using a selection algorithm rather than a sorting algorithm, we can do this in linear time - $O(n)$. We do this by modifying the [[6.5 Quick Sort|Quick Sort]] algorithm, and worrying only about one of partitions on either side of the pivot.

> [!consider] Consider the Running Time of `RSelect`
> Depends on how 'well' we pick the pivot. A poorly chosen pivot can result in an at worst $O(n^2)$ running time, but this incredibly unlikely. Your computer is more likely to be struck by a meteor than for this to happen.

> **The best pivot is the median element.**  But this is circular. We prove that the recurrence $T(n) \le T(\frac{n}{2} + O(n))$ = $O(n)$ using the second case of the [[2.4 Master Theorem|Master Theorem]].

| Scenario        | Running Time        | Note                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Best Case       | $O(n)$              | The pivot always splits the array in half     |
| Average Case    | $O(n)$              | On average, splits are reasonably good         |
| Worst Case      | $O(n^2)$            | The pivot is the smallest or largest element   |
| Expected Time   | $O(n)$              | Average case, assuming random pivot selection  |
