> [!idea] Linked Lists
>
> Linked lists are a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.

> class Node:
>     def __init__(self, data):
>         self.data = data
>         self.next = None

> class LinkedList:
>     def __init__(self):
>         self.head = None

> Linked lists can be classified into three main types:
>
> 1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains a single reference to the next node in the sequence.
> 2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes, allowing for traversal in both directions.
> 3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node in the sequence points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
>
> **Pros of Linked Lists:**
>
> - **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, which makes them more flexible when dealing with data whose size changes over time.
> - **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is generally faster than an array, especially for operations at the beginning of the list or in the middle, assuming you have direct access to the point of insertion/deletion.
> - **No Memory Wastage**: Linked lists allocate memory as needed, so there's no need to allocate excess memory upfront, as is often the case with arrays.
>
>**Cons of Linked Lists:**
>
> - **Sequential Access**: Accessing an element in a linked list requires traversing from the beginning of the list, which can be slow compared to the direct access provided by arrays.
> - **Memory Overhead**: Each element in a linked list requires extra memory for storing the reference (pointer) to the next (and possibly previous) node, which can be significant, especially with a large number of elements.
> - **Complexity**: Implementing and managing linked lists can be more complex than arrays, especially when it comes to more sophisticated operations or types of linked lists (e.g., doubly linked or circular linked lists).
> - **Poor Cache Performance**: The non-contiguous storage of linked list elements can lead to poor cache performance, making linked list operations slower than those on arrays for certain tasks.

> | Insertion       | O(1) at Start or End (with tail pointer in singly-linked list or in doubly-linked lists)<br>O(n) between two nodes or at End without tail pointer in singly-linked list |
> | Deletion        | O(1) at Start<br>O(n) at End without tail pointer in singly-linked list or between two nodes<br>O(1) at End in doubly-linked lists or singly-linked lists with tail pointer |
> Accessing or searching for an element in a linked list requires traversing the nodes sequentially, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). However, insertion and deletion operations can be performed efficiently in constant time O(1) by adjusting the references between nodes.
