> [!idea] Skip Lists
> 
> Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that provides efficient **search, insertion, and deletion operations with complexity of $O(\log n)$**. They are a variation of [[6.1 Linked Lists|linked lists]] that offer improved performance by maintaining multiple levels of linked lists, allowing for faster traversal.
> 
> Key characteristics of skip lists:
> 
> 1. **Balanced**: Skip lists are designed to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search and insertion operations.
> 
> 2. **Ordered**: Elements in a skip list are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search and retrieval.
> 
> 3. **Dynamic**: Skip lists support dynamic insertion and deletion of elements, allowing the data structure to adapt to changes in the dataset.
> 
> 4. **Randomized**: The levels of each node in a skip list are determined randomly, providing a probabilistic guarantee of efficiency.
> 
> Skip lists consist of **multiple levels of linked lists**, with **each level being a subset of the level below it**. The bottom level (level 0) contains all the elements, while higher levels contain fewer elements, acting as express lanes for faster traversal. The topmost level typically consists of a single node.

> [!consider] Express Subways
>
> Skip lists can be conceptually compared to the express lanes in subway systems:
> 
> 1. **Multiple Levels**: Just as skip lists have multiple levels of linked lists, subway systems often have multiple tracks or lines, with some lines serving as express lanes that skip certain stations.
> 
> 2. **Faster Traversal**: In a skip list, higher levels allow for faster traversal by skipping over elements in lower levels. Similarly, express lanes in subways skip certain stations, enabling faster travel times between distant stations.
> 
> 3. **Efficient Search**: Searching for an element in a skip list starts from the topmost level and moves down to lower levels when needed. This is analogous to a subway rider who starts their journey on an express lane and switches to a local lane when approaching their destination, optimizing their travel time.
> 
> 4. **Reduced Stops**: Higher levels in a skip list contain fewer elements, reducing the number of "stops" during traversal. Express subway lanes also have fewer stops, allowing for quicker trips between major stations.
> 
> 5. **Probabilistic Efficiency**: The levels in a skip list are determined randomly, providing a probabilistic guarantee of efficient search and traversal. Similarly, the efficiency of express lanes in subways depends on factors like the distribution of riders and the frequency of trains, which may have probabilistic elements.
> 
> While the analogy is not perfect, the concept of express lanes in subways provides a helpful mental model for understanding the structure and benefits of skip lists in terms of faster traversal and efficient search.
