> Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that provides efficient **search, insertion, and deletion operations with complexity of $O(\log n)$**. They are a variation of [[6.1 Linked Lists|linked lists]] that offer improved performance by maintaining multiple levels of linked lists, allowing for faster traversal.

> Key characteristics of skip lists:
> 
> 1. **Balanced**: Skip lists are designed to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search and insertion operations.
> 
> 2. **Ordered**: Elements in a skip list are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search and retrieval.
> 
> 3. **Dynamic**: Skip lists support dynamic insertion and deletion of elements, allowing the data structure to adapt to changes in the dataset.
> 
> 4. **Randomized**: The levels of each node in a skip list are determined randomly, providing a probabilistic guarantee of efficiency.
> 
> Skip lists consist of **multiple levels of linked lists**, with **each level being a subset of the level below it**. The bottom level (level 0) contains all the elements, while higher levels contain fewer elements, acting as express lanes for faster traversal. The topmost level typically consists of a single node.

> To search a skip list (ride the subway), start with the most express level (L1), look right until you've gone too far, then go back 1 node and down to the next list (T2). Repeat.

> The optimal number of linked lists in a skip list is determined by balancing the trade-off between the additional space complexity introduced by having multiple levels and the improved search and traversal efficiency.

> Having $\log_2 n$ linked lists in a skip list, where $n$ is the number of elements, provides an optimal balance and results in efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with an average time complexity of $O(\log n)$. Here's why:
>
> 1. **Probabilistic Distribution**: In a skip list, the probability of a node being present at a higher level decreases geometrically. Typically, the probability is set to 1/2, meaning that each node has a 50% chance of being promoted to the next higher level. This probabilistic distribution ensures that the number of nodes at each level decreases exponentially as we move up the levels.
>
> 2. **Height of the Skip List**: With $\log_2 n$ linked lists, the expected height of the skip list becomes $O(\log n)$. This means that the number of levels grows logarithmically with the number of elements in the skip list. Having a logarithmic height allows for efficient search and traversal operations.
>
> 3. **Search Efficiency**: During a search operation, the skip list is traversed starting from the topmost level. If the desired element is not found at the current level, the search moves down to the next lower level. With $\log_2 n$ linked lists, the expected number of steps required to find an element becomes $O(\log n)$, as the search can skip over a significant portion of elements at each level. // todo: mention search complexity intuitively = height of skiplist * width of each level
>
> 4. **Insertion and Deletion Efficiency**: Insertion and deletion operations in a skip list also benefit from having $\log_2 n$ linked lists. When inserting a new element, the number of levels for the new node is determined probabilistically. On average, the number of levels modified during an insertion or deletion operation is $O(\log n)$, resulting in an efficient time complexity.
>
> 5. **Space Complexity**: While having multiple linked lists increases the space complexity compared to a single linked list, the space overhead is still relatively low. With $\log_2 n$ linked lists, the expected space complexity becomes $O(n)$, as each element appears in $O(\log n)$ levels on average. This space complexity is acceptable considering the improved search and traversal efficiency.

> It's important to note that the choice of $\log_2 n$ linked lists is based on theoretical analysis and provides an optimal balance between efficiency and space complexity. In practice, the actual number of linked lists may vary depending on the specific implementation and requirements of the skip list.

This explanation delves into the reasons why having $\log_2 n$ linked lists in a skip list is considered optimal. It covers the probabilistic distribution of nodes, the logarithmic height of the skip list, the resulting search efficiency, insertion and deletion efficiency, and the acceptable space complexity trade-off.
