>
> Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that provides efficient **search, insertion, and deletion operations with complexity of $O(\log n)$**. They are a variation of [[6.1 Linked Lists|linked lists]] that offer improved performance by maintaining multiple levels of linked lists, allowing for faster traversal.

> Key characteristics of skip lists:
>
> 1. **Balanced**: Skip lists are designed to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search and insertion operations.
>
> 2. **Ordered**: Elements in a skip list are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search and retrieval.
>
> 3. **Dynamic**: Skip lists support dynamic insertion and deletion of elements, allowing the data structure to adapt to changes in the dataset.
>
> 4. **Randomized**: The levels of each node in a skip list are determined randomly, providing a probabilistic guarantee of efficiency.
>
> 5. **Probabilistic Structure**: Skip lists are built based on probabilistic principles. Each element in the skip list has a probability $p$ (usually 1/2) of being promoted to the next higher level. This probabilistic promotion of elements creates a hierarchical structure with multiple levels, where the expected number of nodes at each level decreases geometrically.

> Skip lists consist of **multiple levels of linked lists**, with **each level being a subset of the level below it**. The bottom level (level 0) contains all the elements, while higher levels contain fewer elements, acting as express lanes for faster traversal. The topmost level typically consists of a single node. Each node contains pointers to every node on it's side (left, right, above and below)

> The probabilistic nature of skip lists enables efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. The expected number of levels in a skip list is $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements. This probabilistic structure allows skip lists to maintain a balance between the number of levels and the overall performance, providing an efficient alternative to other balanced search structures like self-balancing binary search trees.

> [!idea]+ Riding the Subway (Searching)
>
> To search a skip list (ride the subway), start with the top most level. If the next element in the current level is less than the target element, go to that element. Otherwise, go down a level.

> [!idea]+ Splitting / Concatenating
> Search through list, and update pointers. A 2nd head points to where the end of the first list used to point to.  End of the first list points to null.

> [!idea]+ Deletion
> Search for the predecessor of the node to be deleted. Update pointers for this node to be what the deleted node points to.
