Here's the callout with the pseudocode implementation of the Node and SkipList classes added:

> [!idea] Skip Lists
> 
> Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that provides efficient **search, insertion, and deletion operations with complexity of $O(\log n)$**. They are a variation of [[6.1 Linked Lists|linked lists]] that offer improved performance by maintaining multiple levels of linked lists, allowing for faster traversal.
> 
> Key characteristics of skip lists:
> 
> 1. **Balanced**: Skip lists are designed to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search and insertion operations.
> 
> 2. **Ordered**: Elements in a skip list are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search and retrieval.
> 
> 3. **Dynamic**: Skip lists support dynamic insertion and deletion of elements, allowing the data structure to adapt to changes in the dataset.
> 
> 4. **Randomized**: The levels of each node in a skip list are determined randomly, providing a probabilistic guarantee of efficiency.
> 
> 5. **Probabilistic Structure**: Skip lists are built based on probabilistic principles. Each element in the skip list has a probability $p$ (usually 1/2) of being promoted to the next higher level. This probabilistic promotion of elements creates a hierarchical structure with multiple levels, where the expected number of nodes at each level decreases geometrically.
> 
> Skip lists consist of **multiple levels of linked lists**, with **each level being a subset of the level below it**. The bottom level (level 0) contains all the elements, while higher levels contain fewer elements, acting as express lanes for faster traversal. The topmost level typically consists of a single node. Each node contains pointers to every node on it's side (left, right, above and below)

> [!idea]+ Searching
> 
> To search a skip list, start with the top most level. If the next element in the current level is less than the target element, go to that element. Otherwise, go down a level.

> [!idea]+ Insertion
> 
> To insert a new element into a skip list, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Create a new node with the value to be inserted.
> 2. Flip a coin repeatedly until a head is obtained. The number of flips determines the height (level) of the new node.
> 3. Start at the highest level of the skip list and traverse horizontally until finding the appropriate position to insert the new node at that level.
> 4. Insert the new node at the current level and update the pointers of the neighboring nodes accordingly.
> 5. Move down to the next level and repeat steps 3-4 until the lowest level is reached.

>         newNode = new Node(value)

> Explanation:
> 1. Create a new node `newNode` with the value to be inserted.
> 2. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the nodes at each level where the new node will be inserted.
> 3. Start at the head node of the skip list.
> 4. Traverse the skip list from the highest level to the lowest level.
> 5. For each level, move horizontally to the right until finding the position where the new node should be inserted (the node with the largest value less than the new node's value).
> 6. If the current level is less than the new node's level (determined by coin flips), push the current node onto the stack.
> 7. If the current level is not the lowest level, move down to the next level.
> 8. After traversing all levels, start inserting the new node at each level where it belongs (popped from the stack).
> 9. Update the pointers (`left`, `right`, `above`, `below`) of the new node and its neighboring nodes accordingly.
> 10. If the new node's level is higher than the current maximum level of the skip list, update `maxLevel`.
> 
> The insertion operation ensures that the new node is inserted at the appropriate position at each level while maintaining the proper pointers between nodes. The coin flips determine the height of the new node, allowing for a probabilistic balance of the skip list.


> [!idea]+ Splitting / Concatenating
> Search through list, and update pointers. A 2nd head points to where the end of the first list used to point to.  End of the first list points to null.

> [!idea]+ Deletion
> Search for the predecessor of the node to be deleted. Update pointers for this node to be what the deleted node points to.
