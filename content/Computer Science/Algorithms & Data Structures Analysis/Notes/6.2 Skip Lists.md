> [!idea] Skip Lists
> 
> Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that provides efficient **search, insertion, and deletion operations with complexity of $O(\log n)$**. They are a variation of [[6.1 Linked Lists|linked lists]] that offer improved performance by maintaining multiple levels of linked lists, allowing for faster traversal.
> 
> Key characteristics of skip lists:
> 
> 1. **Balanced**: Skip lists are designed to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring efficient search and insertion operations.
> 
> 2. **Ordered**: Elements in a skip list are stored in sorted order, enabling efficient search and retrieval.
> 
> 3. **Dynamic**: Skip lists support dynamic insertion and deletion of elements, allowing the data structure to adapt to changes in the dataset.
> 
> 4. **Randomized**: The levels of each node in a skip list are determined randomly, providing a probabilistic guarantee of efficiency.
> 
> Skip lists consist of **multiple levels of linked lists**, with **each level being a subset of the level below it**. The bottom level (level 0) contains all the elements, while higher levels contain fewer elements, acting as express lanes for faster traversal. The topmost level typically consists of a single node.

> [!idea]+ Riding the Subway (Searching for 59)
> To search a skip list (ride the subway), start with the most express level (L1), look right until you've gone too far, then go back 1 node and down to the next list (T2). Repeat.

> [!idea]+ Splitting / Concatenating
> Search through list, and update pointers. A 2nd head points to where the end of the first list used to point to.  End of the first list points to null.

> Do the opposite for concatenating.

> [!idea]+ Deletion
> Search for the predecessor of the node to be deleted. Update pointers for this node to be what the deleted node points to.

> [!consider] Optimal Number of Linked Lists in a Skip List
>
> The optimal number of linked lists in a skip list is determined by balancing the trade-off between the additional space complexity introduced by having multiple levels and the improved search and traversal efficiency.
>
> Having $\log_2 n$ linked lists in a skip list, where $n$ is the number of elements, provides an optimal balance and results in efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with an average time complexity of $O(\log n)$.
