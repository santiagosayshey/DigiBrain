> Graph traversal is the process of **visiting each node in a graph**. It is a fundamental operation in graph algorithms and is used for tasks such as searching for a specific vertex, determining connectivity, or exploring the structure of the graph.

> Efficient graph traversal algorithms should be able to visit all vertices in a graph in **linear time, i.e., $O(V + E)$**, where $V$ is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

> Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level. Starting from a source node, BFS visits all the neighbours of the current node before moving on to the next level of unvisited nodes.

> The key idea behind BFS is to use a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited. The algorithm works as follows:

> 1. Choose a starting vertex and enqueue it.
> 2. While the queue is not empty:
>    - Dequeue a vertex from the queue.
>    - Mark the dequeued vertex as visited.
>    - Enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the dequeued vertex.

> BFS guarantees that vertices closer to the starting vertex will be visited before vertices farther away. This property makes BFS useful for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs or for exploring the graph in a level-wise manner.

Now, let's create a series of images to illustrate how BFS works on an example graph. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Create a simple graph with 6 vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. Add edges between the following pairs of vertices: (A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, F).

2. In the first image, highlight vertex A as the starting vertex and show it being enqueued.

3. In the second image, dequeue vertex A and mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors, B and C.

4. In the third image, dequeue vertex B and mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors, D and E.

5. In the fourth image, dequeue vertex C and mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbor, F.

6. In the fifth image, dequeue vertex D and mark it as visited. It has no unvisited neighbors, so nothing is enqueued.

7. In the sixth image, dequeue vertex E and mark it as visited. It has no unvisited neighbors, so nothing is enqueued.

8. In the final image, dequeue vertex F and mark it as visited. The queue is now empty, and all vertices have been visited.

These images will demonstrate the level-by-level exploration of the graph using BFS, showing how vertices are enqueued, dequeued, and marked as visited throughout the traversal process.
