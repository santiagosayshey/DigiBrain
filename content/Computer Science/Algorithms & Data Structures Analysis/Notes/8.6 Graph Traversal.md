> [!consider] Graph Traversal
> 
> Graph traversal is the process of **visiting each node in a graph**. It is a fundamental operation in graph algorithms and is used for tasks such as searching for a specific vertex, determining connectivity, or exploring the structure of the graph.
>
> Efficient graph traversal algorithms should be able to visit all vertices in a graph in **linear time, i.e., $O(V + E)$**, where $V$ is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
>
> There are two primary approaches to graph traversal:
> 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
> 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

> [!idea] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
>
> Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that **explores the graph level by level**, ensuring it visits all vertices at the present "breadth" or layer before moving on to nodes at the next layer.

>    - Enqueue all the unvisited neighbours of the dequeued vertex.

> The `BFS` function takes the graph and the starting node as input. It initializes a queue, a visited array, a distance array (to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node), and a parent array (to store the parent of each node in the BFS tree).
>
> The starting node is enqueued, marked as visited, and its distance is set to 0. Then, the algorithm enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, it dequeues a node, marks it as visited, and enqueues all its unvisited neighbors. It also updates the distance and parent information for each newly visited node.
>
> Finally, the function returns the visited array, distance array, and parent array, which can be used for further analysis or to reconstruct the shortest paths from the start node to any other node in the graph.


> [!idea] Depth-First Search (DFS)

> Depth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that **explores the graph as far as possible along each branch before backtracking**. It visits the deepest nodes in the graph first before gradually visiting nodes at shallower depths.

> The key idea behind DFS is to use a stack data structure (often implemented recursively) to keep track of the nodes to be visited. The algorithm works as follows:
