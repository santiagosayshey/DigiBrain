> [!consider] Graph Traversal
> 
> Graph traversal is the process of **visiting each node in a graph**. It is a fundamental operation in graph algorithms and is used for tasks such as searching for a specific vertex, determining connectivity, or exploring the structure of the graph.
>
> Efficient graph traversal algorithms should be able to visit all vertices in a graph in **linear time, i.e., $O(V + E)$**, where $V$ is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
>
> There are two primary approaches to graph traversal:
> 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
> 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

> [!idea] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
>
> Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level. Starting from a source node, BFS visits all the neighbours of the current node before moving on to the next level of unvisited nodes.

> The key idea behind BFS is to use a queue data structure to keep track of the vertices to be visited. The algorithm works as follows:
>
> 1. Choose a starting node and add it to the queue.
> 2. While the queue is not empty:
>    - Dequeue a vertex from the queue.
>    - Mark the dequeued vertex as visited.
>    - Enqueue all the unvisited neighbours of the dequeued vertex.
> 3. Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.
>
> BFS guarantees that vertices closer to the starting vertex will be visited before vertices farther away. This property makes BFS useful for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs or for exploring the graph in a level-wise manner.
