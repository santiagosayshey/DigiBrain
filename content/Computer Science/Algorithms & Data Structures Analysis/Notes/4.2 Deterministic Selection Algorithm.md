> We already found a selection algorithm in [[4.1 Randomised Selection Algorithm|RSelect]] that can sort on average in $O(n)$ time, why bother with anything else? Because DSelect is fucking cool, that's why. Ok but really, DSelect provides an at worst $O(n)$ running time by carefully selecting the pivot, rather than at random.
