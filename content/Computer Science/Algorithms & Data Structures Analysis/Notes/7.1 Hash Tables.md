> [!idea]+ Hash Tables
> 
> A hash table is a dynamic data structure that allows for **efficient insertion, deletion, and searching** of elements using a **unique key**. It achieves **constant time $O(1)$** for these basic operations by using a **hash function** to map keys to indices in an underlying array. This makes hash tables **highly useful for maintaining and manipulating sets of data** where quick access is essential.

> | Operation | Time Complexity |
> |-----------|----------------|
> | Insertion | O(1)           |
> | Deletion  | O(1)           |
> | Search    | O(1)           |

> Hash tables are also known as **dictionaries** and **do not maintain any particular order** of elements. They are designed to provide **consistent performance without any worst-case scenarios** when implemented properly.

> Imagine your parents' friends are incredibly unimaginative and decide to name their children using integers. In this scenario, you can easily store and retrieve their phone numbers using an **array**, where the **index corresponds to the child's name**. For example, to find the phone number of the child named "15," you simply look at index 15 in the array, achieving **immediate access $O(1)$**.

> Hash tables work similarly, but instead of using only integers as keys, you can **use any data type**, such as strings for names. This allows for **efficient storage and retrieval of various types of data**, making hash tables a **versatile and powerful tool** in computer science.

> [!application] Application: De-Duplication
>
> - **Given**: A stream of objects (linear scan through a file line by line, or objects arriving in real-time, such as packets in a router).
> - **Goal**: Remove duplicates and keep track of unique objects.
> - **Solution**: When a new object `x` arrives, look up `x` in a hash table. If it exists, ignore it. Otherwise, add it to the hash table.

> [!application] Application: 2-SUM Problem
>
> - **Input**: An unsorted array `A` of `n` integers and a target sum `T`.
> - **Goal**: Determine whether or not there are two numbers `x` and `y` in `A` such that `x + y = T`.
> - **Naive solution**: Exhaustive search, which has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.
> - **Better solution**: Sort the array `A` $O(n \cdot log n)$ and use binary search $O(\log n)$ to find the complement of each number.
> - **Best solution**: Use a hash table. For each element in the array, search for the difference of the target minus the current number. This operation takes constant time. By iterating through each number in the array, the overall time complexity becomes $O(n)$.
