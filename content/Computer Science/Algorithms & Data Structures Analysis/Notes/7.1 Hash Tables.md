Super useful in the things it does, but does not do a lot (constant time for basic operations, but very simple operations)
Think of it like an array - immediate access at any position (O(1))
Lets say your parents friends are wildly unimaginative and name their kids integers. its super easy to find friend named 15's phone number at position 15 in your array

This is the basic gist of a hash table, but instead of using integers as keys, you can use anything you want - strings for name if you wish

purpose: maintain a possibly evolving set of stuff. transactions, people + data, ip addresses, etc. Needs to be able to insert, delete and search using a key for constant time.

Also known as a dictionary. 

Does not maintain an order (i.e. not sorted)
