> [!idea]+ Hash Tables
> 
> A hash table is a dynamic data structure that allows for **efficient insertion, deletion, and searching** of elements using a **unique key**. It achieves **constant time $O(1)$** for these basic operations by using a **hash function** to map keys to indices in an underlying array. This makes hash tables **highly useful for maintaining and manipulating sets of data** where quick access is essential.

> Hash tables are also known as **dictionaries** and **do not maintain any particular order** of elements. They are designed to provide **consistent performance without any worst-case scenarios** when implemented properly.

> Imagine your parents' friends are incredibly unimaginative and decide to name their children using integers. In this scenario, you can easily store and retrieve their phone numbers using an **array**, where the **index corresponds to the child's name**. For example, to find the phone number of the child named "15," you simply look at index 15 in the array, achieving **immediate access $O(1)$**.

> Hash tables work similarly, but instead of using only integers as keys, you can **use any data type**, such as strings for names. This allows for **efficient storage and retrieval of various types of data**, making hash tables a **versatile and powerful tool** in computer science.


Application: De-Duplication

Given:  a stream of objects (linear scan through a file line by line, or objects arriving in real time - packets in a router)

Goal: you want to remove duplicates (keep track of unique objects)

Solution: when new object x arrives, lookup x in hash table. If exists, ignore it. Otherwise, add it.
