> A problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. In other words, an NP-complete problem is a problem in NP that is at least as hard as any other problem in NP.
>
> To prove that a problem $X$ is NP-complete, we need to show two things:
> 1. $X$ is in NP, meaning that given a solution, we can verify its correctness in polynomial time.
> 2. $X$ is NP-hard, meaning that every problem in NP can be reduced to $X$ in polynomial time.
>
> NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP because if we find a polynomial-time algorithm for any NP-complete problem, we would have a polynomial-time algorithm for all problems in NP, proving that P = NP.

> [!example] NP-Completeness: The Jigsaw Puzzle Problem
> Consider a jigsaw puzzle with a large number of pieces. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to assemble the puzzle in a specific way, given a picture of the completed puzzle.
>
> This problem is NP-complete because:
> 1. Given a proposed solution (an arrangement of the puzzle pieces), you can easily verify whether it matches the completed picture in polynomial time, so the problem is in NP.
> 2. The problem is also NP-hard, as many other problems in NP, such as the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, can be reduced to the jigsaw puzzle problem. For example, you could encode a Hamiltonian Cycle problem as a jigsaw puzzle, where each piece represents a node in the graph, and the connections between pieces represent the edges. Solving the puzzle would then be equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the original graph.

> The jigsaw puzzle problem demonstrates the concept of NP-completeness because it is both in NP (verifiable in polynomial time) and NP-hard (other NP problems can be reduced to it).
