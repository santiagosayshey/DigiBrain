>[!idea] Why Does Cyber Crime Exist?
>- **Heavy Reliance on IT Systems**: Society has critical online systems, making them targets
>- **Exploitation for Profit**: Cyber-criminals exploit vulnerabilities for illicit gains.
>- **Diverse Motivations**: Beyond profit, motivations include digital piracy for archival purposes, highlighting the variety in cyber-criminal activities.
>- **Ease of Execution**: Cyber-crime can be relatively easy to commit with minimal skill required, lowering the barrier to entry for potential criminals.


We can explain this type of behaviour with a MAO model - **Motivation, Opportunity, Ability**

## Threat Actors

Outside of *for profit*, there are many motivations to engage in cyber crime.

# Why Choose a Career in Cybersecurity?

# How Does Cyber Crime Keep Up?

- Programmers prioritize efficiency, leading to code that's intuitive and reusable but may overlook security.
- Society's success is built on trust, leading to cooperation and market freedom. This inherent trust, however, makes people susceptible to social engineering.
- Asymmetric Sides

|                    | The Good Guys                                                               | **The Bad Guys**                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**           | Must  prevent intrusions 24/7/365                                           | Have all the time in the world to plan, research and execute    |
| **Money**          | Have a limited budget to prepare and respond to multiple attacks            | Organised crime can fun large and complex attacks               |
| **Law**            | Must follow laws (can't hack back)                                          | Have every trick in the book to use                             |
| **Success Factor** | All or nothing. Every attack must be thwarted all the time to be succesful. | Only need to find and exploit ONE weakness to exploit ANY TIME. |

# Two Sides of Hacking

**Hacker vs. Cracker:**
- "Crackers" are cyber criminals, differentiated from the original "hacker" community.
- The term didn't catch on with media and public; "hacker" often retains a negative connotation.

**Ethical Hackers:**
- Ethical hackers use their skills for good.
- They conduct activities like penetration testing to protect against cyber threats.

**Color-Coded Hacker Hats:**
- **Black Hat Hacker:** Engages in illegal cyber activities.
- **White Hat Hacker:** Uses skills to protect and defend against cyber attacks.
- **Grey Hat Hacker:** Operates between legal and illegal boundaries, may break into systems to identify flaws but not for personal gain, often reporting back the vulnerabilities to the owner.
