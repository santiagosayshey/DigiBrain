> [!consider]+ The Need for Defense
>
> Memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free bugs can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or leak sensitive data. While secure coding practices and testing are essential, it's nearly impossible to eliminate all vulnerabilities from complex codebases.
>
> Defense in depth is a security principle that advocates **layering multiple protection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of any single vulnerability**. In the context of memory corruption, this means employing a combination of compile-time, runtime, and operating system-level defenses.
>
> Key defense mechanisms include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), stack canaries, non-executable memory (DEP), Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), and Control Flow Integrity (CFI). These defenses work together to prevent exploitation and raise the bar for attackers.


> [!idea] **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**
>
> - **Purpose**: Increases security by randomizing the memory space locations of code and data, complicating exploit attempts.
> - **Mechanism**: Randomly shifts base addresses of executable, libraries, stack, and heap in a process's memory upon loading.
> - **Benefits**: Makes predicting memory layout difficult for attackers, enhancing protection against memory corruption vulnerabilities.
> - **Limitations**: Its effectiveness can be diminished by memory disclosure flaws or non-position-independent code, which may reveal memory layouts or be incompatible with ASLR.

> [!idea] **Stack Canaries (StackGuard)**
>
> - **Purpose**: Provides runtime protection against stack-based buffer overflow attacks by detecting stack corruptions.
> - **Mechanism**:
>   1. Inserts a secret, random "canary" value on the stack between local variables and stack frame metadata.
>   2. Checks the canary's integrity before function returns; program terminates if the canary is altered.
>   3. The canary, generated randomly at program start, is kept secret to thwart attacker predictions.
> - **Types**:
>   - **Random canaries**: Hard-to-guess random values.
>   - **Terminator canaries**: Composed of special characters to prevent string overflows.
> - **Limitations**: Only guards against contiguous stack-based overflows, not other exploits like arbitrary memory writes or heap corruptions. Does not protect against non-control-flow data alterations.

> [!idea] **Executable Space Protection (DEP) Overview**
>
> - **Purpose**: Prevents execution of code in non-executable memory regions to block attacks.
> - **How DEP Works**: Uses hardware features (e.g., NX bit) to mark areas like the stack and heap as non-executable. Unauthorized execution attempts lead to process termination.
> - **Effectiveness**: Strong against shellcode in protected areas, though not foolproof against all attack techniques, such as exploiting executable regions or ret2libc tactics.

> [!idea] **Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection **
>
> - **Objective**: This Windows security feature aims to prevent attackers from exploiting the system's way of managing errors and exceptions to execute harmful code.
> - **How Attacks Work**: In an attack, the wrongdoers target the system's error handling mechanism, specifically aiming to overwrite certain areas where error handlers are listed. This allows them to redirect the program to execute malicious code.
> - **Defense Mechanism**: To counter this, Windows introduces a safeguard in the form of a verification step at the end of the error handler list. If any tampering is detected—meaning the safeguard doesn't check out—the system promptly halts the program to block the execution of any unauthorized code.





Certainly! Here are the callouts for the content in the image:

> [!idea] **Shadow Stack**
>
> - **Function**: Copies the stack in memory to protect the return addresses.
> - **Process**: On a function call, the return address is copied to the shadow stack. On function return, the return address is verified against the shadow stack; mismatches result in a crash.
> - **Security**: The integrity of the shadow stack is crucial; it must remain unaffected by memory corruption.
> - **Implementation**: Uses Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) on Windows 10, 2020 update. The shadow stack pointer (SSP) register and dedicated shadow stack pages are introduced, with specific read/write access.

> [!note] **Tags for Memory Safety**
>
> - **Usage**: Prevent buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.
> - **How It Works**: Memory is tagged with specific codes. Actions causing tag mismatches, like overflows or use-after-free, trigger exceptions.

> [!idea] **Control Flow Integrity (CFI)**
>
> - **Goal**: To ensure that the program's execution follows the predefined paths laid out in the code's flow graph.
> - **Technique**: During compile-time, a list of valid targets is established for indirect calls. At runtime, before such a call, the target is verified to be in the list.
> - **CFI Types**:
>   - **Coarse CFI**: Checks if an indirect call or branch leads to a valid function entry point.

> [!check] **Coarse CFI: Control Flow Guard (CFG) in Windows 10**
>
> - **Protection**: CFG secures indirect calls by comparing them against a list of valid function entry points in the executable.
> - **How It's Done**: Implemented through a guard function (e.g., `@_guard_check_icall`) that verifies if the target address is valid.

> [!warning] **Limitations of CFG, EndBranch, BTI**
>
> - **Issues**:
>   - They do not prevent redirection to a legitimate but incorrect function.
>   - It's challenging to determine all valid targets at compile-time accurately.
