> - **Purpose**: Increases security by randomizing the memory space locations of code and data, complicating exploit attempts.
> - **Mechanism**: Randomly shifts base addresses of executable, libraries, stack, and heap in a process's memory upon loading.

> [!idea] **Stack Canaries (StackGuard)**
>
> - **Purpose**: Provides runtime protection against stack-based buffer overflow attacks by detecting stack corruptions.
> - **Mechanism**:
>   1. Inserts a secret, random "canary" value on the stack between local variables and stack frame metadata.
>   2. Checks the canary's integrity before function returns; program terminates if the canary is altered.
>   3. The canary, generated randomly at program start, is kept secret to thwart attacker predictions.
> - **Types**:
>   - **Random canaries**: Hard-to-guess random values.
>   - **Terminator canaries**: Composed of special characters to prevent string overflows.
> - **Support**: Implemented by major compilers (GCC, Clang, Visual C++).
> - **Limitations**: Only guards against contiguous stack-based overflows, not other exploits like arbitrary memory writes or heap corruptions. Does not protect against non-control-flow data alterations.
> - **Effectiveness**: An essential layer in defense strategies, especially potent when used with ASLR and non-executable stacks, despite some limitations.

> [!idea]+ Executable Space Protection (DEP)
>
> Executable Space Protection, also known as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), is a security feature that marks certain areas of memory as non-executable, preventing the execution of code injected into those regions.
>
> How DEP works:
> - DEP leverages hardware support (e.g., the NX bit on modern CPUs) to mark memory pages as non-executable.
> - When a program attempts to execute code from a marked page, the processor generates an exception, and the operating system terminates the process.
> - Typically, DEP is applied to the stack, heap, and other data regions, while allowing execution from the code section.
>
> Effectiveness and limitations:
> - DEP is highly effective at preventing the execution of shellcode injected into non-executable regions like the stack.
> - However, attackers can still inject code into executable regions like the heap or use techniques like return-to-libc (ret2libc) to bypass DEP.
> - Ret2libc involves redirecting execution to existing code in the program's memory, such as system functions in the C library (libc), rather than injecting new code.
>
> Deployment:
> - DEP is widely supported by modern operating systems, including Windows (since XP SP2), Linux (via the NX bit), and macOS.
> - Administrators can configure DEP policies to be always on, opt-in, or opt-out for specific applications.
>
> While DEP is a powerful defense against code injection, it's not a complete solution on its own. Attackers can still exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities to manipulate existing code or data. Therefore, DEP is most effective when combined with other defenses like ASLR, CFI, and secure coding practices.


> [!idea]+ Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP)
>
> Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) is a security feature implemented by Microsoft Windows to defend against the abuse of structured exception handling (SEH) for exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities.
> 
> SEH exploitation:
> - Windows uses SEH to handle hardware and software exceptions, with a chain of exception handlers stored on the stack.
> - Attackers can exploit stack-based buffer overflows to overwrite SEH records and gain control of the exception handling process.
> - By pointing an exception record to attacker-controlled code on the stack or heap, exploits can bypass stack protections and execute arbitrary code.
>  
> How SEHOP works:
> 1. SEHOP adds a special exception handler record at the end of the SEH chain, serving as a "canary" to detect SEH overwrites.
> 2. When an exception occurs, the dispatcher walks the SEH chain to find a suitable handler. With SEHOP enabled, it checks for the presence of the canary record.
> 3. If the canary is not found (indicating SEH corruption), the dispatcher immediately terminates the process, preventing any attacker-controlled code from executing.
>
> Deployment and limitations:
> - SEHOP is enabled by default on modern Windows versions starting from Windows Vista SP1.
> - It is a valuable defense against SEH-based exploits, which have been a prevalent technique for circumventing stack protections like /GS (stack canaries).
> - However, SEHOP does not prevent the initial memory corruption vulnerability itself. Attackers may still be able to exploit it through other vectors, such as ROP or heap-based techniques.
>
> SEHOP is an important component of Microsoft's multi-layered exploit mitigation strategy. When used in combination with other defenses like DEP, ASLR, and CFG, it helps to significantly reduce the attack surface for memory corruption vulnerabilities on Windows platforms.
