> Network Scanning is an intent and methodical process of uncovering the structure of the network (including firewalls), hosts and applications on it. It helps us to:
> - Reveal new vulnerabilities
> - Detect vulnerable hosts
> - Monitor services deployment
> 
> Scanning helps us find:
> - IP addresses
> - OS versions
> - MAC Addresses
> - Services information
> - Port data
> 
> Scanners should be **fast, scalable and non-intrusive**

| Scan Type | Description | Characteristics | Syntax |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| TCP Full Connect | Completes the full TCP three-way handshake to determine port status | - Most accurate<br>- Easily logged | nmap -sT -v <target IP> |
| Half Open | Begins like full connect but doesn't complete handshake | - Faster than full connect<br>- Lower chance of being logged | nmap -sS -v <target IP> |
| XMAS | Sends packet with PSH, URG, and FIN flags set simultaneously | - Uses illegal flag combination<br>- Doesn't work on most modern systems | nmap -sX -v <target IP> |
| FIN | Sends packet with only FIN flag set to probe ports | - Responses indicate port state<br>- May not function on newer targets<br>- Can be blocked by firewalls | N/A |
| Banner Grabbing | Retrieves information about target system and services | - Identifies OS and running services<br>- Collects application-specific details from services<br>- Can use Telnet or SSH | N/A |
