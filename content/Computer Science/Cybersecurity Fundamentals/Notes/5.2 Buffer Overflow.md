> [!idea]+ Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
>
> A buffer overflow is a security vulnerability that **occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer (array) than it can hold**, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations.

>
> Why buffer overflows are dangerous:
> - The overflowed data **can corrupt important program information** stored in memory
> - Attackers can intentionally overflow buffers to **overwrite control data like return addresses or function pointers**
> - By carefully crafting their input, **attackers can hijack program execution and run arbitrary code**
>
> **Example:** Consider an ATM program in C that prompts users to enter their name:
>
> ```c
> void getName() {
>     char name[20];
>     printf("Enter your name: ");
>     gets(name);
>     // ...
> }
> ```
>
> The `name` buffer can only hold 20 characters, but `gets()` allows writing an arbitrary length string. An attacker could input a very long name:
>
> ```
> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x10\x21\x51\x31...
> ```
>
> The `A`s overflow the buffer, and the `\x10\x21\x51\x31` bytes overwrite the return address. When `getName()` returns, execution jumps to the attacker's code instead of the intended location.

> **Potential outcomes of buffer overflow attacks**:
> - Crashing the program (benign case)
> - Redirecting execution to an existing function (e.g. `dispenseMoney()`)
> - **Injecting and executing custom shellcode** (e.g. spawning a shell, stealing data) 
>
> **Solutions and mitigations**:
> - Use **runtime bounds checking** to validate array indices and sizes (performance overhead) (Implemented in Python, Rust, Java but not C, C++)
> - Employ secure string handling functions that limit input length
> - Enable compiler protections like stack canaries, ASLR, and DEP
> - Most importantly, write secure code that validates untrusted input 
>
> In summary, buffer overflows allow attackers to corrupt memory and hijack program control flow. Careful programming practices are essential to prevent these dangerous vulnerabilities.
