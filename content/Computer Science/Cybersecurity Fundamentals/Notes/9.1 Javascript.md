> [!motivation] Understanding JavaScript's Role in Web Exploits
> 
> JavaScript, a client-side programming language, is a **powerful tool for creating interactive web experiences**. However, its versatility and browser support also make it a **prime target for attackers seeking to exploit web applications**. 
>
> By understanding how JavaScript can be misused, developers can better protect their applications from common vulnerabilities like **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. 

> [!idea] JavaScript: A Double-Edged Sword
> 
> JavaScript is a scripting language that runs in the user's web browser, allowing for dynamic and interactive web pages. It can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), make HTTP requests, and access browser features like cookies and local storage.
>
> While these capabilities enable rich web experiences, they can also be abused by attackers. Malicious JavaScript code injected into a web page can steal sensitive data, hijack user sessions, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. 
>
> Understanding JavaScript's potential for misuse is the first step in defending against web exploits that leverage this powerful language.

> [!example] A Simple JavaScript Exploit
> 
> Imagine a web page with a search form that includes the user's query in the results page without proper sanitization:
>
> ```html
> <p>You searched for: <?php echo $_GET['query']; ?></p>
> ```
>
> An attacker could craft a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the query parameter:
>
> ```
> https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS');</script>
> ```
>
> When a user visits this URL, the browser will execute the injected JavaScript, displaying an alert popup. While this example is harmless, it demonstrates the potential for more dangerous exploits.

The diagram should have three components: Attacker, Web Server, and User's Browser, with arrows indicating the flow of the malicious payload.]

> [!consider] JavaScript's Role in Advanced Web Exploits
>
> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) are two common web exploits that heavily rely on JavaScript:
> 
> - In XSS attacks, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a web page, which is then executed by the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions.
>
> - CSRF attacks trick users into making unintended requests to a web application using their authenticated session. JavaScript can be used to automatically submit forms or make API calls on behalf of the user.
>  
> To defend against these exploits, developers must implement proper input validation, output encoding, and security headers like `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` for cookies. By understanding how JavaScript can be abused, developers can create more secure web applications.
