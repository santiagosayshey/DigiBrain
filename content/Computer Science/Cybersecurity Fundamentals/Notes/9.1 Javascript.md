> [!motivation] Understanding JavaScript's Role in Web Exploits
> 
> JavaScript, a client-side programming language, is a **powerful tool for creating interactive web experiences**. However, its versatility and browser support also make it a **prime target for attackers seeking to exploit web applications**. 
>
> By understanding how JavaScript can be misused, developers can better protect their applications from common vulnerabilities like **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. 

> [!idea] JavaScript: A Double-Edged Sword
> 
> JavaScript is a **scripting language that runs in the user's web browser**, allowing for dynamic and interactive web pages. It can **manipulate the DOM**, **make HTTP requests**, and **access cookies and local storage**.
>
> While these capabilities enable rich web experiences, they can also be abused by attackers. Malicious JavaScript code injected into a web page can **steal sensitive data**, **hijack user sessions**, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. 
>

> [!example] A Simple JavaScript Exploit
>
> Imagine a web page with a search form that includes the user's query in the results page without proper sanitization:
>
> ```js
> <p>You searched for: <span id="query-output"></span></p>
>
> <script\>
>   // Get the query parameter from the URL
>   const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
>   const query = urlParams.get('query');
>
>   // Render the user's query on the page without sanitization
>   const queryOutput = document.getElementById('query-output');
>   queryOutput.textContent = query;
> </script\>
> ```
>
> An attacker could craft a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the query parameter:
>
> ```js
> https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS');</script\>
> ```
>
> When a user visits this URL, the browser will execute the injected JavaScript, displaying an alert popup. While this example is harmless, it demonstrates the potential for more dangerous exploits.

> [!consider] JavaScript's Role in Advanced Web Exploits
>
> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) are two common web exploits that heavily rely on JavaScript:
> 
> - In XSS attacks, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a web page, which is then executed by the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions.
>
> - CSRF attacks trick users into making unintended requests to a web application using their authenticated session. JavaScript can be used to automatically submit forms or make API calls on behalf of the user.
>  
> To defend against these exploits, developers must implement proper input validation, output encoding, and security headers like `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` for cookies. By understanding how JavaScript can be abused, developers can create more secure web applications.![[JS Exploit Example.png]]
