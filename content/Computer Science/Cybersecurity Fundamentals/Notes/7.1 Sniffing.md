> [!idea] Sniffing
> 
> Sniffing is the process of **capturing and analysing network traffic**. It involves monitoring and recording the data packets that are transmitted over a network. Sniffers, also known as packet analyzers, are tools used to perform sniffing.
> 
> - Sniffing can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network troubleshooting and monitoring, but it can also be used maliciously to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data.
> - In a network, data packets are transmitted in plain text unless encryption is used. Sniffers can capture these unencrypted packets and extract information from them.
> - Sniffing can be performed on both wired and wireless networks.

> [!idea] Examples and Tools for Sniffing
> 
> Examples of Sniffing:
> 1. Network Troubleshooting: Diagnosing network issues by capturing and analyzing traffic.
> 2. Password Sniffing: Capturing packets containing login credentials in unsecured networks.
> 3. Email Sniffing: Intercepting and extracting sensitive information from unencrypted emails.
> 4. VoIP Sniffing: Recording unencrypted Voice over IP calls, compromising privacy.
> 
> Tools for Sniffing:
> 1. Wireshark: Popular open-source packet analyzer with a graphical user interface.
> 2. tcpdump: Command-line packet analyzer for Unix-based systems.
> 3. Kismet: Wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system.
> 4. Ettercap: Comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks and network sniffing.
> 5. Dsniff: Collection of command-line tools for network auditing and penetration testing.
> 
> Encryption protocols like HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and VPN can help protect sensitive data from unauthorized sniffing. Use secure communication channels whenever possible.

> [!example] Case Study 1: Starbucks Public Wi-Fi Sniffing
>
> In 2019, a security researcher conducted an experiment to demonstrate the risks of using public Wi-Fi networks. He visited a Starbucks coffee shop and used a sniffing tool called Wireshark to capture network traffic on the public Wi-Fi.
>
> The researcher discovered that many customers were using the Wi-Fi network without any encryption, exposing their sensitive information. He was able to capture the following data:
> - Usernames and passwords for various online services
> - Email messages and attachments
> - Social media interactions and private messages
> - Unencrypted HTTP traffic revealing browsing history
>
> The researcher did not use or disclose any of the captured information and reported his findings to raise awareness about the risks of using public Wi-Fi without proper security measures, such as using a VPN or only accessing encrypted websites (HTTPS).

> [!example] Case Study 2: Firesheep Extension for Session Hijacking
>
> In 2010, a developer released a Firefox extension called Firesheep, which demonstrated the ease of session hijacking attacks on unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. Session hijacking involves stealing the session cookies of authenticated users to gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
>
> Firesheep automated the process of sniffing and hijacking sessions by capturing unencrypted session cookies transmitted over the network. The extension provided a user-friendly interface that allowed anyone to select a victim's session and impersonate them with a single click.
>
> The impact of Firesheep was significant:
> - It highlighted the widespread lack of encryption on popular websites, including Facebook, Twitter, and others.
> - It demonstrated how easily an attacker could compromise user accounts on unencrypted networks.
> - It raised awareness about the importance of using encryption (HTTPS) to protect user sessions.
>
> The release of Firesheep prompted many websites to adopt HTTPS encryption by default, improving the overall security of web browsing. It also emphasized the need for users to be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks and to ensure they are accessing secure websites.
