> 
> Sniffing is the process of **capturing and analysing network traffic**. It involves monitoring and recording the data packets that are transmitted over a network. Sniffers, also known as packet analyzers, are tools used to perform sniffing.
> 
> - Sniffing can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network troubleshooting and monitoring, but it can also be used maliciously to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data.
> - In a network, data packets are transmitted in plain text unless encryption is used. Sniffers can capture these unencrypted packets and extract information from them.
> - Sniffing can be performed on both wired and wireless networks.

> [!example] Case Study 1: Starbucks Public Wi-Fi Sniffing
>
> In 2019, a security researcher conducted an experiment to demonstrate the risks of using public Wi-Fi networks. He visited a Starbucks coffee shop and used a sniffing tool called Wireshark to capture network traffic on the public Wi-Fi.
>
> The researcher discovered that many customers were using the Wi-Fi network without any encryption, exposing their sensitive information. He was able to capture the following data:
> - Usernames and passwords for various online services
> - Email messages and attachments
> - Social media interactions and private messages
> - Unencrypted HTTP traffic revealing browsing history
>
> The researcher did not use or disclose any of the captured information and reported his findings to raise awareness about the risks of using public Wi-Fi without proper security measures, such as using a VPN or only accessing encrypted websites (HTTPS).
