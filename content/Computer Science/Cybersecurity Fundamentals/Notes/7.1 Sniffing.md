> [!idea] Sniffing
> 
> Sniffing is the process of **capturing and analysing network traffic**. It involves monitoring and recording the data packets that are transmitted over a network. Sniffers, also known as packet analyzers, are tools used to perform sniffing.
> 
> - Sniffing can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network troubleshooting and monitoring, but it can also be used maliciously to capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data.
> - In a network, data packets are transmitted in plain text unless encryption is used. Sniffers can capture these unencrypted packets and extract information from them.
> - Sniffing can be performed on both wired and wireless networks.

> [!idea] Examples and Tools for Sniffing
> 
> Examples of Sniffing:
> 1. Network Troubleshooting: Diagnosing network issues by capturing and analyzing traffic.
> 2. Password Sniffing: Capturing packets containing login credentials in unsecured networks.
> 3. Email Sniffing: Intercepting and extracting sensitive information from unencrypted emails.
> 4. VoIP Sniffing: Recording unencrypted Voice over IP calls, compromising privacy.
> 
> Tools for Sniffing:
> 1. Wireshark: Popular open-source packet analyzer with a graphical user interface.
> 2. tcpdump: Command-line packet analyzer for Unix-based systems.
> 3. Kismet: Wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system.
> 4. Ettercap: Comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks and network sniffing.
> 5. Dsniff: Collection of command-line tools for network auditing and penetration testing.
> 
> Encryption protocols like HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and VPN can help protect sensitive data from unauthorized sniffing. Use secure communication channels whenever possible.
