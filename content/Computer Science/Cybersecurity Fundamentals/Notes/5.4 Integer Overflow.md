> [!idea]+ Integer Overflow
>
> An integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is **outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits**.
>
> Why integer overflows are dangerous:
> - They can **lead to unexpected behavior**, such as incorrect calculations or values.
> - Attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities to **bypass security checks** or cause a system to crash.
> - In some cases, it can allow **privilege escalation** or **remote code execution**.
>
> **Example:** The Gandhi Nuke Bug in Civilization
>
> In the original Civilization game, each leader's aggression level was represented by an 8-bit unsigned integer. Gandhi's aggression was set at the lowest possible value to reflect his peaceful nature. However, adopting democracy reduces a leader's aggression by 2. This reduction caused Gandhi's aggression level to underflow from 0 to 255 (the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer), making him extremely aggressive and more likely to use nuclear weapons.
> **Solutions and mitigations**:
> - Use **safe arithmetic operations** that check for overflow conditions.
> - Validate all inputs and ensure they do not cause overflows when processed.
> - Employ programming languages or libraries that offer built-in protection against integer overflow.
>
> In summary, integer overflows can cause programs to behave unpredictably, leading to security vulnerabilities and logical errors. Understanding and guarding against these issues are essential for robust software development.****
