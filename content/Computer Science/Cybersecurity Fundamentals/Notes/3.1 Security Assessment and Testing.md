>     - Social engineering
>     - Phishing
> 
> **Protecting C.I.A**
> - Firewall and Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)
> - Antimalware solutions
> - Educating users on security best practices
> - Designing secure systems from the ground up
> - Implementing robust access control measures
> - System configuration hardening
> - Regular patches and upgrades
> - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
> - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
> - Advanced user/entity behavior analytics
> - Comprehensive incident response planning
> 
> Security tests are conducted to find [[Vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] in applications / infrastructure before the bad guys do.


> [!idea]+ Security Assessment
> Testing your application periodically to make sure they are:
> - Implemented correctly
> - Operating as intended
> - Producing the right outcome
>   
>  Produces a list of actions to improve the security of the application. Types of assessments include:
>  - Vulnerability Scanning
>  - Configuration Review
>  - Penetration Testing
>  - Code Review
>  - Read Teaming
>  - Architecture Review
