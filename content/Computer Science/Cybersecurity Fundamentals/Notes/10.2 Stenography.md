> [!idea] Steganography
> 
> **Definition**: Steganography is the practice of **concealing messages or information within other non-secret text** or data.
> 
> **In Text**: Hidden messages can be embedded in text by manipulating fonts, spacing, or using invisible characters.
> 
> **In Images**: Information can be hidden within images by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel values, making the changes imperceptible to the human eye.

> [!idea] Steganalysis
> 
> **Definition**: Steganalysis is the process of **detecting the presence of steganography** within files.
> 
> **Techniques**: Common techniques include statistical analysis of files to detect anomalies, examining pixel patterns in images, and using machine learning algorithms to identify hidden data.

> [!example] Example: Video Steganography to Catch Pirates
> 
> **Illustrative Example**: Movie studios embed unique canaries within video files to identify the source of leaks. These canaries can be **slight alterations in frame data or watermarks that are invisible** to viewers but detectable through analysis.
> 
> **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
> 1. Original video: A high-definition movie file.
> 2. Embedded canaries: Unique identifiers such as slightly altered frames, invisible watermarks, or modified audio samples.
> 3. Leak detection: When a pirated copy is found, studios analyze the video file to extract the embedded canaries and trace back to the source of the leak.
> 
> **Practical Impact**: This method allows movie studios to identify and take action against individuals or groups responsible for leaking content, thereby protecting their intellectual property.

> [!example] Example: Image Steganography
> 
> **Illustrative Example**: An image file where the LSB of each pixel's color value is altered to encode the hidden message.
> 
> **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
> 1. Original image: A standard JPEG image.
> 2. Hidden message: The binary data of the hidden message is split and embedded into the LSB of each pixel.
> 3. Extracting the hidden message involves reading the LSBs of the image pixels and reconstructing the binary data.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations
> 
> **Steganographic Tools**: Various software tools are available for implementing steganography, such as OpenPuff, Steghide, and SilentEye.
> 
> **Legal and Ethical Implications**: While steganography can be used for legitimate privacy protection, it can also be misused for hiding illicit activities. Understanding the legal and ethical boundaries is crucial.
