> [!idea] Steganography
> 
> **Definition**: Steganography is the practice of **concealing messages or information within other non-secret text** or data.
> 
> **In Text**: Hidden messages can be embedded in text by manipulating fonts, spacing, or using invisible characters.
> 
> **In Images**: Information can be hidden within images by modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of pixel values, making the changes imperceptible to the human eye.

> [!idea] Steganalysis
> 
> **Definition**: Steganalysis is the process of **detecting the presence of steganography** within files.
> 
> **Techniques**: Common techniques include statistical analysis of files to detect anomalies, examining pixel patterns in images, and using machine learning algorithms to identify hidden data.

> [!example] Example: Text Steganography
> 
> **Illustrative Example**: Consider a simple text document where every nth character is part of the hidden message. For instance, in the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," selecting every third character reveals the hidden message.
> 
> **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
> 1. Original text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
> 2. Hidden message: Extracting every third character gives "eikoojs e aly."
> 3. Reconstructing the hidden message based on the predetermined pattern.

> [!example] Example: Image Steganography
> 
> **Illustrative Example**: An image file where the LSB of each pixel's color value is altered to encode the hidden message.
> 
> **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
> 1. Original image: A standard JPEG image.
> 2. Hidden message: The binary data of the hidden message is split and embedded into the LSB of each pixel.
> 3. Extracting the hidden message involves reading the LSBs of the image pixels and reconstructing the binary data.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations
> 
> **Steganographic Tools**: Various software tools are available for implementing steganography, such as OpenPuff, Steghide, and SilentEye.
> 
> **Legal and Ethical Implications**: While steganography can be used for legitimate privacy protection, it can also be misused for hiding illicit activities. Understanding the legal and ethical boundaries is crucial.
