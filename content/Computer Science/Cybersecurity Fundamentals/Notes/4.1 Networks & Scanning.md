> [!idea]+ The Internet
> A global network that provides best effort delivery of packets between connected hosts.
> - **Packet**: A structured sequence of bytes -> [[Pasted image 20240312071549.png|Image]]
> - **Header**: metadata used by network
> - **Payload:** user data to be transported
> - **IP Address:** A unique identifier for every host
> 
> A series of routers receive packets, look at the destination address in the headers, and send it one hope towards the destination of the IP address.


> [!idea]+ Network Protocols
> We define how hosts communicate using established network protocols.
> - **Syntax:** how communication is structured - the format and order of messages
> - **Semantics:** What communication means, Actions taken on transmit or receipt of message, or when a timer expires. What assumptions can be made.
> 
> Networks use a stack of protocol layers.
> - Each layer has different responsibilities
> - Layers define abstraction boundaries
>   
> Lower layers provide services to layers above
> - Don't care what higher layers do
>   
> Higher layers use services of layers below
> - Don't worry about how it works

# OSI 5 Layer Model

| Layer | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Application | Defines how individual applications communicate. For example, HTTP defines how browsers send requests to web servers. | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| Transport | Allows a client to establish a connection to specific services (e.g., web server on port 80). Provides reliable communication. | TCP, UDP |
| Network | Packet forwarding. How to get a packet to the final destination when there are many hops along the way. | IP, ICMP, IPSec |
| Data Link | How to get packet to the next hop. Transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical link. | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP |
| Physical | How do bits get translated into electrical, optical, or radio signals | Ethernet physical layer, DSL, Bluetooth |

> [!idea]+ Internet Protocol (IP)
> Defines what packets that cross the internet need to look like to be processed by routers.
> - Every host is assigned a unique identifier (IP Address)
> - Every packet has an IP header that indicates its sender and receiver
> - Routers forward packets along to *try* and get it to the destination host
> - Rest of the packet should be ignored by the router
>

> [!consider] Consider Two Problems
> **Local:** How does a host know what MAC address their destination has given an IP address?
> **Internet:** How does each router know where to send each packet next?


> [!idea]+ Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
> 
> ARP is a network protocol that **maps IP addresses to MAC addresses**. When a host needs to find the MAC address for an IP, it broadcasts an ARP packet asking, "Who has IP address N?" The host with IP address N replies, "IP N is at MAC address M." This allows devices on a network to communicate using both logical (IP) and physical (MAC) addressing.

> [!idea]+ Dynamic Assignment of IP Address (DHCP)
> 
> DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to **dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network**. When a device connects to the network, it sends a broadcast message requesting an IP address. The DHCP server responds by leasing an available IP address to the device for a set period of time. This automates the process of IP address assignment, reducing configuration errors and saving administrators time. DHCP also provides additional network configuration parameters to devices, such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses.

> [!idea]+ Ports
> 
> Applications on a host machine are identified by a **port number.**. TCP connection established between port A on host X to port B on host Y
> 
> - Ports are 1-65535 (16 bits)
> - Some destination port numbers used for specific applications by convention
> 
> | Port | Application           |
> |------|----------------------|
> | 80   | HTTP (Web)           |
> | 443  | HTTPS (Web)          |
> | 25   | SMTP (mail)          |
> | 22   | SSH (secure shell)   |
> | 23   | Telnet               |


> [!idea]+ User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
> A transport layer protocol that is a wrapper around IP. It adds ports to demultiplex traffic by application.

> [!idea]+ TCP Three Way Handshake (SYN-ACK) and Connection Reset
> 
> The TCP three-way handshake is the process used to establish a TCP connection between two hosts. It involves the exchange of three specific segments: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK.
> 
> 1. **SYN**: The client sends a SYN (Synchronize) segment to the server, proposing to start a new connection.
> 
> 2. **SYN-ACK**: If the server accepts the connection, it responds with a SYN-ACK segment.
> 
> 3. **ACK**: Finally, the client acknowledges the server's SYN-ACK by sending an ACK segment.
> 
> After these three segments are exchanged, the TCP connection is considered established, and both the client and server can start sending data.
> 
> **TCP Connection Reset:**
> - TCP is designed to handle the possibility of previous TCP packets
> - Packets that are invalid given the current state of the session generate a reset.
>   - If a connection exists, it is torn down.
>   - If a packet with the RST flag is sent in response, it indicates that no such connection exists.
> - If a host receives a TCP packet with the RST flag, it tears down the connection.

> [!idea]+ TCP Connection Termination (FIN-ACK)
> 
> The TCP connection termination process involves the exchange of FIN and ACK segments to gracefully close a connection between two hosts.
> 
> 1. **FIN**: When one host (let's say the client) decides to close the connection, it sends a FIN segment to the other host (the server). This segment indicates that the client has finished sending data and wants to close the connection.
> 
> 2. **ACK**: The server, upon receiving the FIN segment, acknowledges it by sending an ACK segment back to the client. This ACK segment confirms that the server has received the client's request to close the connection.
> 
> 3. **FIN**: After sending the ACK, the server also sends its own FIN segment to the client, indicating that it has finished sending data and is ready to close the connection from its side.
> 
> 4. **ACK**: Finally, the client acknowledges the server's FIN segment by sending an ACK segment back to the server. This confirms that the client has received the server's request to close the connection.
> 
> After this exchange of FIN and ACK segments, the TCP connection is considered closed, and both the client and server can release the resources associated with the connection.
