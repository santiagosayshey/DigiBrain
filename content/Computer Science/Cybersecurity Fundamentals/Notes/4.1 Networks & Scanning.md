> [!idea]+ The Internet
> A global network that provides best effort delivery of packets between connected hosts.
> - **Packet**: A structured sequence of bytes -> [[Pasted image 20240312071549.png|Image]]
> - **Header**: metadata used by network
> - **Payload:** user data to be transported
> - **IP Address:** A unique identifier for every host
> 
> A series of routers receive packets, look at the destination address in the headers, and send it one hope towards the destination of the IP address.


> [!idea]+ Network Protocols
> We define how hosts communicate using established network protocols.
> - **Syntax:** how communication is structured - the format and order of messages
> - **Semantics:** What communication means, Actions taken on transmit or receipt of message, or when a timer expires. What assumptions can be made.
> 
> Networks use a stack of protocol layers.
> - Each layer has different responsibilities
> - Layers define abstraction boundaries
>   
> Lower layers provide services to layers above
> - Don't care what higher layers do
>   
> Higher layers use services of layers below
> - Don't worry about how it works

# OSI 5 Layer Model

| Layer | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Application | Defines how individual applications communicate. For example, HTTP defines how browsers send requests to web servers. | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| Transport | Allows a client to establish a connection to specific services (e.g., web server on port 80). Provides reliable communication. | TCP, UDP |
| Network | Packet forwarding. How to get a packet to the final destination when there are many hops along the way. | IP, ICMP, IPSec |
| Data Link | How to get packet to the next hop. Transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical link. | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP |
| Physical | How do bits get translated into electrical, optical, or radio signals | Ethernet physical layer, DSL, Bluetooth |
