> [!motivation] The Need for Security Engineering
> In today's **increasingly connected digital landscape, software systems face a myriad of cybersecurity threats**. Data breaches, malware attacks, and unauthorized access can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised user privacy. A**ddressing these risks early in the development lifecycle is crucial** for building secure and resilient systems.

> [!idea] Security Engineering
> Security Engineering is the **practice of designing, implementing, and maintaining software systems with a focus on protecting against potential security threats**. It involves integrating security considerations into every phase of the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. By adopting a **proactive approach to security, organizations can identify and mitigate risks early**, reducing the cost and complexity of addressing vulnerabilities later in the development process.

> [!example] Applying Security Engineering Principles
> Consider a web application that handles sensitive user data, such as financial information. By applying security engineering principles, the development team can:
> 1. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access.
> 2. Employ encryption techniques to protect data in transit and at rest.
> 3. Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
> 4. Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
> By incorporating these security measures from the outset, the application can provide a more secure and trustworthy user experience.

> [!consider] Frameworks and Standards
> To guide security engineering efforts, various frameworks and standards have been developed. Some notable examples include:
> - OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project): Provides guidelines, tools, and best practices for web application security.
> - NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology): Offers a comprehensive framework for managing information security risks.
> - ISO/IEC 27001: Specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an information security management system.
> Adhering to these frameworks and standards helps organizations align their security practices with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

| Principle                 | Explanation                                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keep Security Simple      | Use simple, well-understood security controls and avoid complex, error-prone solutions.                          | Implement a straightforward role-based access control system instead of a complex, custom authorization mechanism.                        |
| Make Security Usable      | Design security features that are user-friendly and intuitive to encourage adoption and proper usage.            | Provide clear, concise instructions for setting up multi-factor authentication to ensure users can easily enable and use the feature.     |
| Least Privilege           | Grant users and processes only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.                         | Restrict access to sensitive data based on job roles, ensuring employees can only access information relevant to their responsibilities. |
| Segregation of Duties     | Divide critical tasks among multiple individuals to prevent any single person from having excessive control.     | Require separate individuals to initiate and approve financial transactions to reduce the risk of fraud.                                 |
| Defence in Depth          | Implement multiple layers of security controls to provide comprehensive protection.                              | Combine firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security updates to create a multi-layered defence against cyber threats.    |
| Zero Trust                | Assume all users, devices, and networks are untrusted until proven otherwise.                                    | Require authentication and authorization for all access attempts, regardless of the source or location.                                  |
| Security by Default       | Configure systems and applications with secure default settings to minimize the attack surface.                  | Disable unnecessary services and ports by default and require explicit configuration to enable them.                                     |
| Fail Securely             | Design systems to fail in a secure manner, minimizing the exposure of sensitive information or functionality.    | Display a generic error message instead of revealing technical details when an application encounters an unexpected condition.            |
| Avoid Security by Obscurity| Rely on well-tested, open security mechanisms rather than obscure or hidden techniques.                          | Use standard encryption algorithms like AES instead of proprietary or custom algorithms that lack thorough security analysis.            |
| Risk-Informed             | Prioritize security efforts based on a thorough understanding of the risks and potential impacts to the business.| Conduct regular risk assessments to identify and address the most critical security vulnerabilities and threats to the organization.     |

By understanding and applying these security principles, organizations can develop a strong foundation for their security engineering practices, ensuring that security is an integral part of the software development lifecycle.
