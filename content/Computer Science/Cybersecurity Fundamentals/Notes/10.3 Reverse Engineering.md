> [!motivation] Need for Reverse Engineering
> 
> Often, we encounter **software or systems without documentation or access to the original source code**. This situation presents several challenges:
> 
> - **Identifying and fixing bugs or vulnerabilities** in the software
> - Integrating the software with other systems or components
> - Assessing the software's security and reliability
> - **Learning from the software's design** and implementation techniques


> [!idea] Reverse Engineering
>
> Reverse engineering is the **process of analysing a software system to identify the system's components** and their interrelationships, **creating representations of the system at a higher level** of abstraction (i.e. binary to source code). This process involves:
> 
> - **Disassembly**: Breaking down compiled executable code into assembly code.
> - **Decompilation**: Transforming machine code back into high-level code.
> - **Static Analysis**: Examining the code without executing it to understand its structure and behavior.
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the code and observing its behavior during execution to understand its functionality.
> 
> Reverse engineering is crucial for understanding undocumented software, integrating systems, and assessing security, but it also has legal and ethical implications.

> [!consider] Legal and Ethical Aspects
> 
> Reverse engineering involves several legal and ethical considerations. It can be used for legitimate purposes, such as:
> 
> - **Security analysis**: Finding and fixing vulnerabilities
> - **Interoperability**: Ensuring compatibility between different systems
> - **Research and learning**: Understanding software design and implementation
> 
> However, it can also be used maliciously:
> 
> - **Software piracy**: Creating unauthorized copies of software
> - **Exploiting vulnerabilities**: Finding and using flaws for malicious purposes
> - **Intellectual property theft**: Stealing proprietary algorithms and techniques

> [!idea] x86 Architecture and Assembly Language
> 
> **What is an Architecture?**
> 
> An architecture **specifies how software and hardware interact, determining how instructions are processed and data is managed.**
> 
> **Why x86 for Reverse Engineering?**
> 
> - **Prevalence**: x86 is widely used in many devices and systems, making it a frequent target for reverse engineering.
> - **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and community support make it easier to learn and understand.
> - **Compatibility**: Understanding x86 helps in analyzing and modifying a wide range of software.
> 
> **Special Registers in x86**:
> 
> - **EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer)**: Points to the current instruction being executed. Crucial for tracing program execution.
> - **ESP (Extended Stack Pointer)**: Points to the top of the stack. Important for managing function calls and local variables.
> - **EBP (Extended Base Pointer)**: Used to reference function parameters and local variables in the stack frame.
> 
> These registers are essential for managing the execution flow and stack operations, allowing precise control and manipulation of data and instructions during reverse engineering.
> 
> **Important Instructions**:
> 
> | Instruction              | Description |
> |--------------------------|-------------|
> | `add eax, 0x5`           | Adds 0x5 to the `eax` register. `eax` is a general-purpose register used in arithmetic and data manipulation. |
> | `sub eax, 0x5`           | Subtracts 0x5 from the `eax` register. |
> | `mul eax, edx`           | Multiplies `eax` by `edx`, storing the result in `edx`. |
> | `div eax, edx`           | Divides `eax` by `edx`, storing the quotient in `eax` and the remainder in `edx`. |
> | `cmp eax, 0x10`          | Compares `eax` with 0x10, setting flags based on the result. |
> | `mov eax, edx`           | Moves the contents of `edx` into `eax`. |
> | `mov eax, [edx]`         | Moves the contents of the memory address pointed to by `edx` into `eax`. |
> | `lea eax, [ebx+4*edx]`   | Loads the effective address represented by `ebx + 4*edx` into `eax`. |
> | `call 0x8004bc`          | Calls the function at address `0x8004bc`, storing the return address on the stack. |
> | `ret`                    | Returns from the function, restoring the address from the stack. |
> | `jmp 0x8004bc`           | Unconditionally jumps to address `0x8004bc`. |

> [!example] Example: Assembly Instructions
> 
> Let's look at a simple program that adds two numbers and returns the result. The equivalent assembly code helps understand what each instruction does.
> 
> **C Code**:
> ```c
> int add(int a, int b) {
>     return a + b;
> }
> ```
> 
> **Assembly Code**:
> ```assembly
> _add:
>     push ebp             ; Save the base pointer
>     mov ebp, esp         ; Set the base pointer to the current stack pointer
>     mov eax, [ebp+8]     ; Move the first argument (a) into eax
>     add eax, [ebp+12]    ; Add the second argument (b) to eax
>     pop ebp              ; Restore the base pointer
>     ret                  ; Return from the function, result is in eax
> ```
> 
> **Explanation**:
> 
> | Instruction           | Description |
> |-----------------------|-------------|
> | `push ebp`            | Saves the current base pointer (`ebp`) on the stack to preserve the calling function's stack frame. |
> | `mov ebp, esp`        | Sets the base pointer (`ebp`) to the current stack pointer (`esp`), establishing a new stack frame for the called function. |
> | `mov eax, [ebp+8]`    | Moves the first argument, located at `[ebp+8]`, into the `eax` register. This is the first parameter of the function. |
> | `add eax, [ebp+12]`   | Adds the second argument, located at `[ebp+12]`, to the value in the `eax` register. |
> | `pop ebp`             | Restores the previous base pointer from the stack, reverting to the caller's stack frame. |
> | `ret`                 | Returns from the function, with the result of `a + b` in the `eax` register. The return address is restored, and control goes back to the calling function. |

> [!idea] Disassemblers and Decompilers
>
> Disassemblers and decompilers are tools for **reverse engineering software without source cod**e.
>
> **Disassemblers**:
> - **Function**: **Convert machine code (binary) into assembly language**, allowing for low-level analysis of the program's instructions.
> - **Usage**: Useful for understanding how a program operates at the instruction level and for identifying specific functions and control flows.
>
> **Decompilers**:
> - **Function**: **Transform machine code into high-level code**, such as C or C++, providing a more abstract and human-readable view of the software.
> - **Usage**: Useful for getting an overview of the software's logic and for identifying higher-level constructs and algorithms.

> [!example] Example: OpenGoal Project for Jak and Daxter Games
>
> The OpenGoal project is an excellent example of reverse engineering without source code. The project aims to decompile the Jak and Daxter games, converting their binary code back into a readable and modifiable form.
>
> **Process**:
> - **Disassembly**: The project begins by disassembling the game's binary files to understand the low-level instructions and control flow.
> - **Decompilation**: The next step involves using a decompiler to convert these instructions into high-level code, making it easier to analyze and modify.
> - **Reconstruction**: The decompiled code is then reconstructed and refined to match the original game's logic and functionality.
>
> **Benefits**:
> - **Preservation**: Helps preserve classic games by making them accessible and modifiable.
> - **Learning**: Provides insights into game design and programming techniques used in the original games.
> - **Modding**: Allows the community to create mods and improvements for the game.

> [!consider] Static vs. Dynamic Analysis
> 
> - **Static Analysis**: Involves examining the code without executing it, useful for understanding structure and detecting potential vulnerabilities.
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Involves executing the code and observing its behavior, useful for understanding runtime behavior and identifying hidden issues.
