> [!motivation] Reading Between the Lines
> 
> In various scenarios, we may encounter software or systems that **lack documentation or access to the original source code**. This can pose challenges when attempting to:
> 
> - **Identify and fix bugs or vulnerabilities** in the software
> - Integrate the software with other systems or components
> - Assess the software's security and reliability
> - **Learn from the software's design** and implementation techniques
> 
> However, it's important to note that the **same techniques can also be employed maliciously**, such as:
> 
> - Analyzing software to **identify and exploit vulnerabilities**
> - **Reverse engineering proprietary software** to create unauthorized copies or bypass licensing mechanisms
> - Studying code to **plagiarize or steal intellectual property**

> [!idea] Reverse Engineering
>
> Reverse engineering is the **process of analysing a software system to identify the system's components** and their interrelationships, **creating representations of the system at a higher level** of abstraction (i.e. binary to source code). This process involves:
> 
> - **Disassembly**: Breaking down compiled executable code into assembly code.
> - **Decompilation**: Transforming machine code back into high-level code.
> - **Static Analysis**: Examining the code without executing it to understand its structure and behavior.
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the code and observing its behavior during execution to understand its functionality.
> 
> Reverse engineering is crucial for understanding undocumented software, integrating systems, and assessing security, but it also has legal and ethical implications.

> [!example] Example: Hello World in Assembly
>
> Consider a simple "Hello World" program in C and its equivalent in assembly language. This illustrates the translation from high-level code to low-level instructions:
> 
> **C Code**:
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
> int main() {
>     printf("Hello, World!\n");
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
> 
> **Assembly Code**:
> ```assembly
> section .data
>     hello db 'Hello, World!', 0
> 
> section .text
> global _start
> _start:
>     mov edx, 13        ; message length
>     mov ecx, hello     ; message to write
>     mov ebx, 1         ; file descriptor (stdout)
>     mov eax, 4         ; system call number (sys_write)
>     int 0x80           ; call kernel
> 
>     mov eax, 1         ; system call number (sys_exit)
>     int 0x80           ; call kernel
> ```
> 
> **Explanation**:
> 
> | Instruction           | Description |
> |-----------------------|-------------|
> | `mov edx, 13`         | Set the length of the message to 13 bytes |
> | `mov ecx, hello`      | Point to the message string |
> | `mov ebx, 1`          | Set the file descriptor to stdout |
> | `mov eax, 4`          | Set the system call number for write |
> | `int 0x80`            | Invoke the kernel to perform the write |
> | `mov eax, 1`          | Set the system call number for exit |
> | `int 0x80`            | Invoke the kernel to exit the program |

> [!consider] Legal and Ethical Aspects
> 
> Reverse engineering has both legal and ethical considerations. It can be used for legitimate purposes, such as:
> 
> - **Security analysis**: Finding and fixing vulnerabilities
> - **Interoperability**: Ensuring compatibility between different systems
> - **Research and learning**: Understanding software design and implementation
> 
> However, it can also be used maliciously:
> 
> - **Software piracy**: Creating unauthorized copies of software
> - **Exploiting vulnerabilities**: Finding and using flaws for malicious purposes
> - **Intellectual property theft**: Stealing proprietary algorithms and techniques

> [!idea] Assembly Language Overview
> 
> Assembly language provides a direct way to manipulate hardware with low-level instructions. Common architectures include x86 (Intel and AT&T syntax). Important instructions for reverse engineering include:
> 
> | Instruction              | Description |
> |--------------------------|-------------|
> | `add eax, 0x5`           | Add 0x5 to eax |
> | `sub eax, 0x5`           | Subtract 0x5 from eax |
> | `mul eax, edx`           | Multiply eax by edx, store result in edx |
> | `div eax, edx`           | Divide eax by edx, store quotient in eax, remainder in edx |
> | `cmp eax, 0x10`          | Compare eax with 0x10, setting flags |
> | `mov eax, edx`           | Move contents of edx to eax |
> | `mov eax, [edx]`         | Move contents of memory pointed by edx to eax |
> | `lea eax, [ebx+4*edx]`   | Load effective address (ebx + 4*edx) into eax |
> | `call 0x8004bc`          | Call function at address 0x8004bc |
> | `ret`                    | Return from function, restore address |
> | `jmp 0x8004bc`           | Unconditional jump to address 0x8004bc |

> [!example] Example: Assembly Instructions
>
> Consider the instruction `add eax, 0x5`:
> - **Instruction**: `add eax, 0x5`
> - **Operation**: Adds the immediate value 0x5 to the eax register.
> - **Importance**: Modifies the value of eax, which can affect subsequent operations.

> [!consider] Static vs. Dynamic Analysis
> 
> - **Static Analysis**: Involves examining the code without executing it, useful for understanding structure and detecting potential vulnerabilities.
> - **Dynamic Analysis**: Involves executing the code and observing its behavior, useful for understanding runtime behavior and identifying hidden issues.

> [!idea] Tools for Reverse Engineering

> - **Interactive GUI**: Allows for detailed analysis and manipulation of code.
