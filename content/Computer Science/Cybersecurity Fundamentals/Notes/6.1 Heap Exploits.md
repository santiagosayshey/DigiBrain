> [!idea]+ Heap Overflow Vulnerabilities
>  
> A heap overflow vulnerability occurs when a program writes more data to a heap-allocated buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations.
>
> Why heap overflows are dangerous:
> - The overflowed data can corrupt important program data stored in adjacent heap memory
> - Attackers can intentionally overflow heap buffers to overwrite critical data like function pointers or object metadata
> - By carefully crafting their input, attackers can manipulate heap structures to execute arbitrary code
>
> **Example:** Consider a simple program in C that copies user input into a heap buffer:
>
> ```c
> void processInput(char *input) {
>     char *buffer = (char *)malloc(8);
>     strcpy(buffer, input);
>     // ...
> }
> ```
>
> The heap `buffer` is only allocated 8 bytes, but `strcpy` allows copying an arbitrary length string. An attacker could input a very long string:
>
> ```
> AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCC...
> ```
>
> The input overflows the buffer, corrupting adjacent heap memory. This could overwrite function pointers or heap metadata.
>
> **Potential outcomes of heap overflow attacks**:
> - Crashing the program by corrupting heap metadata
> - Overwriting function pointers to redirect execution flow
> - Manipulating other heap-allocated objects and their behavior
> - Bypassing security checks by overwriting heap-based flags or authorization data
