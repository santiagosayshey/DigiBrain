I apologize for my confusion. You are absolutely right. SQL injection attacks should be included in the SQL document to maintain a logical flow and keep related topics together. Let me revise the structure of the notes accordingly.

Note 5: SQL and SQL Injection
\[!idea\] Introduction to SQL
- What is SQL?
- Role of SQL in web applications
\[!example\] Sample SQL queries for web applications

\[!idea\] Basic SQL Statements
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- WHERE clause for filtering
- UNION for combining results
\[!example\] Examples of each SQL statement

\[!idea\] SQL Injection Attacks
- What is SQL injection?
- How SQL injection works
- Types of SQL injection attacks:
  - Authentication bypass (\[!example\] ' OR 1=1--)
  - UNION query injection (\[!example\] Extracting sensitive data)
  - Blind SQL injection (\[!example\] Inferring data through behavioral differences)
\[!consider\] Impact of SQL injection attacks on web applications

Note 6: OWASP Top 10 and Other Injection Attacks
\[!idea\] OWASP Top 10 Web Vulnerabilities
- What is OWASP?
- Overview of the OWASP Top 10
- !\[\[OWASP Top 10.png\]\] (include the OWASP Top 10 image)

\[!idea\] Command Injection Attacks
- What is command injection?
- How command injection works
