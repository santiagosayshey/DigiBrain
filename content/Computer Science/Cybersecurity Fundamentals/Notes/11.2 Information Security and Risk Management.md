> [!idea] Information Security and Risk Management
> 
> Information Security and Risk Management involve **protecting information assets from threats and managing the risks associated with them**. This encompasses identifying, assessing, and implementing controls to mitigate risks and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
> - **Plan**: Develop a strategy for managing risks.
> - **Implement**: Apply the necessary controls and measures.
> - **Monitor**: Continuously observe the effectiveness of controls.
> - **Measure/Audit**: Evaluate the performance of controls.
> - **Improve**: Enhance controls and strategies based on feedback and audit results.








> [!idea] Understanding Risks (NIST SP 800-30)
> 
> Risks refer to the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. According to NIST SP 800-30, risks are identified through the analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and the potential impact on information assets.

> [!example] Risk Examples
> 
> - **Cyberattacks**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
> - **Data Breaches**: Leakage of confidential information.
> - **Natural Disasters**: Physical damage to data centers.

> [!idea] Measuring Risk
> 
> Risk measurement can be done through Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis:
> - **Qualitative Risk Analysis**: Uses subjective measures such as likelihood and impact definitions.
> - **Quantitative Risk Analysis**: Uses numerical measures and statistical methods.

> [!example] Qualitative Risk Analysis
> 
> - **Likelihood Definitions**: High, Medium, Low probability of occurrence.
> - **Impact Definitions**: High, Medium, Low impact on the organization.
> - **Risk Categories**: Strategic, Compliance, Operational, Financial.

> [!idea] Risk Mitigation
> 
> Risk mitigation involves implementing countermeasures to reduce the likelihood or impact of risks. This can include:
> - **Preventive Controls**: Such as firewalls and encryption.
> - **Detective Controls**: Such as intrusion detection systems.
> - **Corrective Controls**: Such as data recovery procedures.

> [!example] Example Risk Analysis
> 
> An organization identifies a risk of data breach with a high likelihood and high impact. They implement encryption (preventive control), monitor network activity (detective control), and establish a data recovery plan (corrective control) to mitigate the risk.


> [!idea] Controls
> 
> Controls are measures implemented to manage risk and ensure the security of information. They can be classified into three main types:
> - **Preventive Controls**: Aim to prevent security incidents.
> - **Detective Controls**: Aim to detect security incidents.
> - **Corrective Controls**: Aim to correct or mitigate the impact of security incidents.

> [!consider] Types of Controls
> 
> Controls can be categorized based on their nature:
> - **Administrative Controls**: Policies, procedures, and guidelines.
> - **Physical Controls**: Security guards, locks, and surveillance cameras.
> - **Technical Controls**: Firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption.

> [!idea] Preventive, Detective, and Corrective Controls
> 
> - **Preventive Controls**: Designed to prevent incidents before they occur (e.g., access control mechanisms).
> - **Detective Controls**: Designed to detect incidents after they occur (e.g., log monitoring).
> - **Corrective Controls**: Designed to mitigate the impact of incidents (e.g., backup and recovery solutions).
