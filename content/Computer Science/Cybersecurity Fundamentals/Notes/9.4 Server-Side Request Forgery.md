> [!idea] Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
> 
> Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that **arises when a web application accepts user-supplied input and uses it to make requests to other systems** or resources on the server-side, without sufficient validation or sanitization. The attacker can manipulate these requests to access internal resources, bypass security controls, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the server.
> 
> In an SSRF attack, the **attacker crafts a malicious request that tricks the server into making an unintended request** to a target system. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's input handling, such as inadequate input validation or improper trust in user-supplied data.

> [!example] SSRF in Action: Exploiting a Vulnerable Weather API
>
> Suppose there's a web application that provides weather information based on user-supplied location data. The application uses an internal API to fetch weather data from a third-party service. However, the application doesn't properly validate the user input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the API request.
>
> Here's how an attacker could exploit this SSRF vulnerability:
>
> 1. Identify the vulnerable endpoint that accepts user-supplied location data.
>
> 2. Craft a malicious URL pointing to an internal resource, e.g., `http://localhost/admin`.
>
> 3. Send the malicious URL as the location input to the vulnerable endpoint.
>
> 4. The application server receives the malicious URL and makes a request to the specified internal resource instead of the intended weather API.
>
> 5. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the internal resource, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing malicious actions.
>
> This example showcases how SSRF can be exploited by manipulating user-supplied input, making the server send requests to unintended internal resources and bypassing security controls.

> [!consider] SSRF vs. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
> 
> While SSRF and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) both involve forged requests, they differ in their targets and impact:
> 
> | Aspect | SSRF | CSRF |
> |--------|------|------|
> | Target | Server-side resources and systems | User's session and actions |
> | Exploited Trust | Server's trust in user-supplied input | User's trust in authenticated session |
> | Impact | Unauthorized access to internal resources, data exfiltration, command execution | Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying account settings or performing transactions |
> 
> While CSRF targets the user's session and tricks them into performing unintended actions, SSRF focuses on exploiting the server's trust to access internal resources and perform unauthorized actions on the server-side.
> 
> Mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities requires a combination of input validation, request filtering, and strict control over server-side requests. Developers should validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, restrict the destinations and protocols allowed for server-side requests, and implement proper access controls to limit the impact of potential SSRF attacks.
