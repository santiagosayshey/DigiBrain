> [!idea]+ Format String Vulnerabilities
>
> A format string vulnerability **occurs when a program uses user input directly in output functions without proper validation**, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
>
> Why format string vulnerabilities are dangerous:
> - Attackers can read or write to arbitrary memory locations
> - **Allows attackers to view stack contents** or manipulate variables, leading to information disclosure or control flow hijacking
> - Utilizing format specifiers (`%s`, `%x`, `%n`, etc.), attackers can craft inputs that **cause the program to crash, disclose sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code**
>
> **Example:** Consider a logging function in C that improperly handles user input:
>
> ```c
> void logUserAction(char *userInput) {
>     int userControlledValue;
>     printf(userInput, &userControlledValue); // Vulnerable usage
>     // ...
> }
> ```
> 
> An attacker can supply a string such as:
> 
> ```
> "AAAA%n" // This will write the value 4 (length of "AAAA") to userControlledValue
> ```
>
> The `%n` specifier is particularly dangerous:
> 
> 1. `%n` tells `printf` to write the number of characters printed so far into the integer variable pointed to by the corresponding argument (in this case, `userControlledValue`).
> 
> 2. The `AAAA` part is just a placeholder to control the value that gets written. In this case, 4 (the length of `AAAA`) will be written to `userControlledValue`.
>
> 3. By carefully crafting the input string, an attacker can write arbitrary values to arbitrary memory locations, such as:
>    
>    ```
>    "AAAA%n" // Write 4 to userControlledValue
>    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA%n" // Write 32 to userControlledValue
>    ```
>
> 4. This can be used to overwrite important program data, like return addresses, function pointers, or access control flags.
>
> For example:
> 
> - If `userControlledValue` is later used as an array index, the attacker could force an out-of-bounds read or write.
> - If `userControlledValue` is used as a loop counter, the attacker could cause the loop to underflow or overflow, potentially leading to infinite loops or buffer overflows.
> - If `userControlledValue` is used as a size for a memory allocation, the attacker could trigger a too-large allocation, leading to out-of-memory errors.
>
>
> **Potential outcomes of format string attacks**:
> - **Leakage of sensitive information** from the stack
> - Arbitrary **memory modification or corruption**
> - Execution control redirection to **attacker-specified locations**
>
> **Solutions and mitigations**:
> - Always use safe functions like `printf("%s", userInput)` instead of `printf(userInput)`
> - Validate all external input to ensure it doesn't contain format specifiers
> - Employ compiler flags and runtime protections to mitigate the impact of such vulnerabilities
> - Education and code reviews to ensure developers are aware of and avoid these vulnerabilities
>
> In summary, format string vulnerabilities present a significant risk, allowing attackers to compromise system integrity and confidentiality. Vigilant programming and validation practices are key to defending against these exploits.****
