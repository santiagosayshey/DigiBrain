> [!idea] Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks using ARP Cache Poisoning
> 
> MITM attacks involve an attacker intercepting the communication between two parties by exploiting the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) and manipulating the ARP cache of network devices.
> 
> **How it works:**
> 1. The attacker sends forged ARP replies, associating their own MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network.
> 2. The victim devices update their ARP cache with the false IP-to-MAC mapping, directing traffic intended for the legitimate device to the attacker's MAC address.
> 3. The attacker can now intercept, sniff, modify, or forward the traffic, effectively becoming a "man in the middle."
> 
> **Potential consequences:**
> - Eavesdropping on communication and stealing sensitive information
> - Modifying data in transit, injecting malicious content, or altering the intended communication
> - Performing session hijacking attacks by stealing session cookies and impersonating authenticated users
> 
> **Countermeasures:**
> - **Static ARP entries**: Use static ARP entries for devices on the network to prevent ARP spoofing.
> - **ARP spoofing detection tools**: Implement tools that can detect and alert administrators about ARP spoofing activities.
> - **Network segmentation**: Limit the impact of potential attacks by segmenting the network and implementing strict access controls.


> [!example] MITM Attack using ARP Cache Poisoning
>
> Scenario:
> - Alice (IP: 192.168.1.100) wants to communicate with Bob (IP: 192.168.1.200).
> - The attacker, Eve (IP: 192.168.1.150), wants to intercept the communication between Alice and Bob.
>
> Step 1: Initial State
> - Alice's ARP cache:
>   - Bob (192.168.1.200) -> MAC_Bob
> - Bob's ARP cache:
>   - Alice (192.168.1.100) -> MAC_Alice
>
> Step 2: ARP Cache Poisoning
> - Eve sends forged ARP replies to Alice and Bob:
>   - To Alice: 192.168.1.200 (Bob) is at MAC_Eve
>   - To Bob: 192.168.1.100 (Alice) is at MAC_Eve
> - Alice's ARP cache is updated:
>   - Bob (192.168.1.200) -> MAC_Eve
> - Bob's ARP cache is updated:
>   - Alice (192.168.1.100) -> MAC_Eve
>
> Step 3: Communication Interception
> - When Alice sends a message to Bob:
>   - Alice's device looks up Bob's IP in its ARP cache and finds the corresponding MAC address (MAC_Eve).
>   - Alice sends the message to MAC_Eve (Eve's MAC address) instead of MAC_Bob.
>   - Eve receives the message intended for Bob.
> - Similarly, when Bob sends a message to Alice:
>   - Bob's device looks up Alice's IP in its ARP cache and finds the corresponding MAC address (MAC_Eve).
>   - Bob sends the message to MAC_Eve (Eve's MAC address) instead of MAC_Alice.
>   - Eve receives the message intended for Alice.
>
> Step 4: Message Manipulation and Forwarding
> - Eve can now choose to:
>   - Read the intercepted messages, gaining access to sensitive information.
>   - Modify the messages before forwarding them to the intended recipient.
>   - Forward the messages unaltered to maintain the appearance of normal communication.
>
> Result:
> - Eve successfully intercepts the communication between Alice and Bob without their knowledge.
> - Eve can eavesdrop on the conversation, steal sensitive data, or manipulate the messages being exchanged.
>
> This example demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the ARP protocol and manipulate the ARP cache to intercept communication between two parties. By sending forged ARP replies, the attacker can redirect the traffic to their own device, enabling them to perform various malicious activities as a "man in the middle."


> [!exercise] DNS Hijacking (Spoofing) Demonstration
>
> **Objective**: Illustrate how DNS hijacking (spoofing) can be executed to redirect DNS requests to a malicious site.
>
> **Key Actions**:
> - Create and host a fake website on Kali Linux.
> - Use `dnsspoof` to intercept and manipulate DNS requests to redirect a victim to the fake website.
> - Observe the behavior of network traffic using `curl` on the victim's machine.
>
> **Commands Used**:
> ```bash
> mv /var/www/html/index.html /var/www/html/index.html.bk
> vi /var/www/html/index.html # Add <h1>Welcome to my website! Enjoy!</h1>
> systemctl start apache2
> dnsspoof
> curl whitehouse.gov
> ```
>
> **Key Points**:
> - Successfully spoofing DNS responses allows an attacker to redirect traffic intended for legitimate sites to fraudulent ones.
> - This technique can be used to capture sensitive information or spread malware.
> - Observing traffic with tools like Wireshark during the attack can provide insights into the spoofing process and its effects on network traffic.
>
> **Note**: Success depends on the spoofed response arriving before the legitimate response, demonstrating the timing critical aspect of such attacks.

> [!exercise] MITM Attack via ARP Cache Poisoning
>
> **Objective**: Demonstrate how ARP cache poisoning can redirect network traffic through an attacker-controlled machine, enabling man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
>
> **Key Actions**:
> - Re-confirm network settings and prepare the attacker's machine for packet forwarding.
> - Use `arpspoof` to manipulate the ARP table of the victim and the gateway.
> - Monitor the effects on the victim's ARP cache.
>
> **Commands Used**:
> ```bash
> arp -n # Check ARP table
> echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # Enable IP forwarding
> sudo arpspoof -t [victim IP] [gateway IP]
> sudo arpspoof -t [gateway IP] [victim IP]
> arp -n # Recheck ARP table
> ```
>
> **Key Points**:
> - ARP spoofing effectively tricks devices into sending traffic through the attacker's machine, intercepting communications between the victim and other network entities.
> - This attack can be used to intercept, modify, or block data packets moving to and from the victim.
> - The ability to manipulate ARP tables is powerful in network environments where devices trust responses without verification.
>
> **Security Implication**: This exercise underscores the importance of securing network infrastructure against layer 2 attacks and highlights the need for network monitoring to detect anomalies like unusual ARP traffic.

> [!exercise] MITM Attack with Ettercap
>
> **Objective**: Utilize Ettercap, a GUI tool in Kali Linux, to automate ARP spoofing and perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
>
> **Key Actions**:
> - Launch Ettercap from the Kali Linux menu or via the command line with `sudo ettercap -G`.
> - Configure Ettercap to scan for hosts on the subnet and select targets for ARP poisoning.
> - Initiate ARP poisoning to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine.
>
> **Commands/Actions Used**:
> - Launch Ettercap: `sudo ettercap -G`
> - Scan for hosts and select targets.
> - Start ARP poisoning via Ettercap GUI.
>
> **Key Points**:
> - Ettercap simplifies ARP spoofing and MITM attacks through its graphical interface, automating many of the steps involved.
> - Target selection is crucial; typically, the victim and the gateway are chosen to intercept traffic between them.
> - ARP cache poisoning effectively redirects network traffic, enabling the interception and manipulation of data packets.
>
> **Security Implication**: Automated tools like Ettercap make it easier for attackers to execute sophisticated attacks, emphasizing the importance of network security measures such as ARP spoofing detection and prevention.
