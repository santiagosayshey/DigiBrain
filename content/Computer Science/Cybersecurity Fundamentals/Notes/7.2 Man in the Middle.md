>
> MITM attacks involve an attacker intercepting the communication between two parties and potentially altering or stealing the data being transmitted. [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] spoofing is a common technique used to facilitate MITM attacks.
>
> - In an ARP spoofing attack, the attacker sends forged ARP replies to associate their own MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network.
> - By doing so, the attacker can intercept the traffic intended for the legitimate device, as other devices will send data packets to the attacker's MAC address instead.
> - The attacker can then sniff the intercepted traffic, modify it, or forward it to the intended recipient, effectively becoming a "man in the middle."
> - MITM attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, modify data in transit, or inject malicious content into the communication.

> [!idea] ARP Cache
>
> The ARP cache, also known as the ARP table, is a local database maintained by each device on a network. It stores the mappings between IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the local network, it consults its ARP cache to find the MAC address associated with the target IP address.
>
> - If the MAC address is found in the cache, the device can send the data packet directly to the intended recipient.
> - If the MAC address is not found, the device broadcasts an ARP request to the network, asking for the MAC address associated with the target IP address. The device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address, and the mapping is added to the ARP cache.

> [!idea] ARP Cache Poisoning (ARP Spoofing)
>
> ARP cache poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing, is a technique used by attackers to manipulate the ARP cache of network devices. The attacker sends forged ARP replies, associating their own MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network.
>
> - The forged ARP replies are unsolicited and do not correspond to actual ARP requests.
> - When a device receives a forged ARP reply, it updates its ARP cache with the false IP-to-MAC mapping, associating the attacker's MAC address with the legitimate device's IP address.
> - As a result, any traffic intended for the legitimate device will be sent to the attacker's MAC address instead.
>
> The attacker can then intercept, sniff, modify, or forward the traffic, effectively becoming a "man in the middle." This allows the attacker to:
> - Eavesdrop on the communication between the victim devices
> - Steal sensitive information like login credentials, session tokens, or confidential data
> - Modify the data in transit, potentially injecting malicious content or altering the intended communication
> - Perform session hijacking attacks by stealing session cookies and impersonating authenticated users
