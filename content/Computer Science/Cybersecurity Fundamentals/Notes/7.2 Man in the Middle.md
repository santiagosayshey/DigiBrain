> [!idea] Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks using ARP Cache Poisoning
> 
> MITM attacks involve an attacker intercepting the communication between two parties by exploiting the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) and manipulating the ARP cache of network devices.
> 
> **How it works:**
> 1. The attacker sends forged ARP replies, associating their own MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network.
> 2. The victim devices update their ARP cache with the false IP-to-MAC mapping, directing traffic intended for the legitimate device to the attacker's MAC address.
> 3. The attacker can now intercept, sniff, modify, or forward the traffic, effectively becoming a "man in the middle."
> 
> **Potential consequences:**
> - Eavesdropping on communication and stealing sensitive information
> - Modifying data in transit, injecting malicious content, or altering the intended communication
> - Performing session hijacking attacks by stealing session cookies and impersonating authenticated users
> 
> **Countermeasures:**
> - **Static ARP entries**: Use static ARP entries for devices on the network to prevent ARP spoofing.
> - **ARP spoofing detection tools**: Implement tools that can detect and alert administrators about ARP spoofing activities.
> - **Network segmentation**: Limit the impact of potential attacks by segmenting the network and implementing strict access controls.


> [!example] MITM Attack using ARP Cache Poisoning
>
> Scenario:
> - Alice (IP: 192.168.1.100) wants to communicate with Bob (IP: 192.168.1.200).
> - The attacker, Eve (IP: 192.168.1.150), wants to intercept the communication between Alice and Bob.
>
> Step 1: Initial State
> - Alice's ARP cache:
>   - Bob (192.168.1.200) -> MAC_Bob
> - Bob's ARP cache:
>   - Alice (192.168.1.100) -> MAC_Alice
>
> Step 2: ARP Cache Poisoning
> - Eve sends forged ARP replies to Alice and Bob:
>   - To Alice: 192.168.1.200 (Bob) is at MAC_Eve
>   - To Bob: 192.168.1.100 (Alice) is at MAC_Eve
> - Alice's ARP cache is updated:
>   - Bob (192.168.1.200) -> MAC_Eve
> - Bob's ARP cache is updated:
>   - Alice (192.168.1.100) -> MAC_Eve
>
> Step 3: Communication Interception
> - When Alice sends a message to Bob:
>   - Alice's device looks up Bob's IP in its ARP cache and finds the corresponding MAC address (MAC_Eve).
>   - Alice sends the message to MAC_Eve (Eve's MAC address) instead of MAC_Bob.
>   - Eve receives the message intended for Bob.
> - Similarly, when Bob sends a message to Alice:
>   - Bob's device looks up Alice's IP in its ARP cache and finds the corresponding MAC address (MAC_Eve).
>   - Bob sends the message to MAC_Eve (Eve's MAC address) instead of MAC_Alice.
>   - Eve receives the message intended for Alice.
>
> Step 4: Message Manipulation and Forwarding
> - Eve can now choose to:
>   - Read the intercepted messages, gaining access to sensitive information.
>   - Modify the messages before forwarding them to the intended recipient.
>   - Forward the messages unaltered to maintain the appearance of normal communication.
>
> Result:
> - Eve successfully intercepts the communication between Alice and Bob without their knowledge.
> - Eve can eavesdrop on the conversation, steal sensitive data, or manipulate the messages being exchanged.
>
> This example demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the ARP protocol and manipulate the ARP cache to intercept communication between two parties. By sending forged ARP replies, the attacker can redirect the traffic to their own device, enabling them to perform various malicious activities as a "man in the middle."
