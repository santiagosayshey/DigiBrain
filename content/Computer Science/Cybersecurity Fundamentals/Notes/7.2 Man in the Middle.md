>
> ARP is a protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC (Media Access Control) addresses in a local network segment. It is essential for communication between devices within a network.
>
> - When a device wants to communicate with another device on the local network, it needs to know the MAC address of the target device.
> - The source device sends an ARP request broadcast, asking for the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
> - The device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address, allowing the source device to send data packets directly to the intended recipient.
> - ARP is a stateless protocol, meaning that devices do not keep track of ARP replies received from other devices.

> MITM attacks involve an attacker intercepting the communication between two parties and potentially altering or stealing the data being transmitted. ARP spoofing is a common technique used to facilitate MITM attacks.
>
> - In an ARP spoofing attack, the attacker sends forged ARP replies to associate their own MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on the network.
> - By doing so, the attacker can intercept the traffic intended for the legitimate device, as other devices will send data packets to the attacker's MAC address instead.
> - The attacker can then sniff the intercepted traffic, modify it, or forward it to the intended recipient, effectively becoming a "man in the middle."
> - MITM attacks can be used to steal sensitive information, modify data in transit, or inject malicious content into the communication.
