> How do we **manage and interact with data in systems** where information constantly changes and grows? Consider the tasks involved in updating customer records, processing transactions, or retrieving specific data quickly and securely.

> [!idea] **SQL Overview**
>
> SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a tool that manages data in relational databases. It allows us to **find, update, insert, and delete data efficiently**, meeting the needs of complex data systems.
>
> Below is a table summarizing the primary SQL commands and some advanced operations:
>
> | Command   | Description                                           | Additional Keywords       |
> |-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
> | **SELECT**    | Retrieves data from database tables.                  | WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY |
> | **INSERT**    | Adds new rows of data to tables.                      |                           |
> | **UPDATE**    | Modifies existing data.                               | WHERE, SET                |
> | **DELETE**    | Removes data.                                         | WHERE                     |
> | **JOIN**      | Combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns. | INNER, OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT |
> | **Subqueries**| Executes a query nested within another query.         |                           |
>
> These commands are foundational for interacting with data in relational databases, each equipped with specific keywords that refine and enhance their functionality:
>
> - **WHERE**: Specifies which rows to select, update, or delete, adding precision to operations.
> - **GROUP BY**: Groups similar data together, often used with aggregate functions.
> - **ORDER BY**: Sorts the data returned by a query in ascending or descending order.
> - **SET**: Specifies the columns to update and the new values in an UPDATE command.

> [!example] **Using SQL SELECT Command**
>
> Suppose we have a database with a table named `Customers`. To retrieve a list of all customers:
> ```sql
> SELECT * FROM Customers;
> ```
> This command fetches all columns and rows from the `Customers` table.

> [!example] **Using SQL JOIN Command**
>
> Consider two tables, `Orders` and `Customers`, where each order is linked to a customer through a `CustomerID`. To retrieve a list of orders along with the customer names:
> ```sql
> SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
> FROM Orders
> INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
> ```
> | OrderID | CustomerName |
> |---------|--------------|
> | 1       | John Doe     |
> | 2       | Jane Smith   |
> 
> This command shows how an INNER JOIN combines rows from both tables where there is a match in `CustomerID`.

> [!example] **Using SQL UPDATE Command**
>
> To update the address for a customer with ID 1 in the `Customers` table:
> ```sql
> UPDATE Customers
> SET Address = '123 New Address'
> WHERE CustomerID = 1;
> ```
> This command changes the address field for the customer whose ID is 1.

These examples are structured to demonstrate the application of SQL commands in typical database operations, using tables for visualization where appropriate, especially with JOIN operations. This approach helps illustrate the practical utility of SQL in managing and analyzing data within databases.
