> [!idea] Introduction to HTTP
>   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a client-server protocol that allows web browsers to request resources from web servers and receive responses.
>   1. A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server.
>   2. The server processes the request and generates an HTTP response.
>   3. The server sends the response back to the client.
>   4. The client receives the response and processes it (e.g., displaying a web page).

> [!idea] HTTP Request Methods
>
> - Common HTTP methods:
>   - GET: Retrieves a resource from the server.
>   - POST: Submits data to be processed by the server.
> - Differences between GET and POST:
>   - GET requests send parameters in the URL, while POST requests send parameters in the request body.
>   - GET requests are typically used for retrieving data, while POST requests are used for submitting data.
>   - GET requests are cached and remain in browser history, while POST requests are not.

> [!example] Sample HTTP GET and POST requests
>
> GET request:
> ```http
> GET /search?q=example HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> ```
>
> POST request:
> ```http
> POST /login HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
> username=john&password=secret
> ```

> [!consider] Cookies in Web Applications
>
> - Purpose of cookies:
>   - Cookies are small pieces of data stored by websites on the user's browser.
>   - They are used to maintain state information between requests, such as user preferences, login sessions, and shopping cart contents.
> - How cookies are set and sent:
>   - Servers send cookies to the browser using the `Set-Cookie` header in HTTP responses.
>   - Browsers include the relevant cookies in subsequent requests to the server using the `Cookie` header.
> - Cookie security attributes:
>   - `HttpOnly`: Prevents client-side access to cookies, mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
>   - `Secure`: Ensures cookies are only sent over secure HTTPS connections.
>   - `SameSite`: Controls whether cookies are sent with cross-site requests, helping prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
