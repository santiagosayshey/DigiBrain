> [!idea] Introduction to HTTP
>   HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a client-server protocol that allows web browsers to request resources from web servers and receive responses.
>   1. A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server.
>   2. The server processes the request and generates an HTTP response.
>   3. The server sends the response back to the client.
>   4. The client receives the response and processes it (e.g., displaying a web page).

> [!idea] HTTP Request Methods
>
> - Common HTTP methods:
>   - GET: Retrieves a resource from the server.
>   - POST: Submits data to be processed by the server.
> - Differences between GET and POST:
>   - GET requests send parameters in the URL, while POST requests send parameters in the request body.
>   - GET requests are typically used for retrieving data, while POST requests are used for submitting data.
>   - GET requests are cached and remain in browser history, while POST requests are not.

> [!example] Sample HTTP GET and POST requests
>
> GET request:
> ```http
> GET /search?q=example HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> ```
>
> POST request:
> ```http
> POST /login HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
> username=john&password=secret
> ```

> [!consider] Statelessness
>
> HTTP doesn't remember past interactions, which complicates how web apps **maintain essential user information like logins** or shopping cart contents. How can these applications manage user data across multiple requests **without some form of memory?**


> [!idea] Cookies
>
> Cookies are small pieces of data stored by websites on a user's browser. Their primary purpose is to **maintain state information between different requests**. This includes tracking user preferences, login sessions, and the contents of shopping carts. Cookies are set by servers using the `Set-Cookie` header in HTTP responses and are sent back to the server by browsers via the `Cookie` header in subsequent requests.
>
> To ensure security, cookies can be equipped with specific attributes:
> - **`HttpOnly`**: This attribute prevents cookies from being accessed by client-side scripts, significantly reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
> - **`Secure`**: It ensures cookies are only transmitted over secure HTTPS connections.
> - **`SameSite`**: This setting helps control how cookies are sent with cross-site requests, providing a defense against CSRF attacks.


> [!example] Sample HTTP GET and POST Requests with Cookies
>
> **Setting a Cookie in a Response:**
> When a user logs in successfully, the server sends a response that includes a `Set-Cookie` header. This cookie, named `sessionToken`, is used to maintain the user's session state across different requests.
> ```http
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Set-Cookie: sessionToken=abc123; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
> Content-Type: text/html
>
> <html\>
>   <body\>
>     <p>Session started.</p\>
>   </body\>
> </html\>
> ```
>
> **Using a Cookie in a GET Request:**
> In subsequent requests, such as accessing a dashboard, the browser includes the `sessionToken` cookie in the request. This lets the server verify that the request is from an authenticated user, maintaining a seamless user experience without requiring a login with each new request.
> ```http
> GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Cookie: sessionToken=abc123
> ```
>
> **Using a Cookie in a POST Request:**
> Similarly, when the user submits data through a POST request, the cookie is included. This confirms the user's identity and session validity, allowing the server to process the request knowing it pertains to an authenticated session.
> ```http
> POST /submit-data HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Cookie: sessionToken=abc123
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
> data=value&moreData=value2
> ```
