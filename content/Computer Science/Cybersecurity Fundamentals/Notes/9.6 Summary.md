> [!idea] Key Concepts from Week 9 Notes
> 
> The week 9 notes cover several important web security concepts, including:
> 
> 1. **JavaScript and Web Exploits**: JavaScript's versatility and browser support make it a target for attackers seeking to exploit web applications through techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
> 
> 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. There are two main types of XSS:
>    - Stored XSS: Malicious scripts are injected into a website's database and delivered to users' browsers.
>    - Reflected XSS: Malicious scripts are injected through URL parameters or form inputs and reflected back to the user's browser.
> 
> 3. **Session Hijacking via XSS**: XSS attacks can facilitate session hijacking by stealing session cookies and sending them to a malicious server, allowing attackers to impersonate victims and access their accounts.
> 
> 4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: CSRF attacks exploit the trust a website has in a user's browser. Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions on a target website without their knowledge or consent.
> 
> 5. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: SSRF vulnerabilities arise when a web application accepts user-supplied input to make requests to other systems or resources on the server-side, allowing attackers to access internal resources or perform unauthorized actions.
> 
> 6. **Forced Browsing and Directory Bursting**: These techniques involve manually crafting URLs or using automated tools to discover and access restricted web pages, directories, or files that are not intended to be public.
> 
> To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is crucial to implement proper input validation, output encoding, secure cookie handling, CSRF protection, and follow best practices for web application security.
