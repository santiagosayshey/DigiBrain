> [!idea] Forced Browsing & Directory Bursting
> 
> Forced Browsing and Directory Bursting are techniques used by attackers to **discover and access restricted web pages, directories, or files that are not intended to be public**. These techniques involve **manually crafting URLs or using automated tools to guess** and enumerate potential file and directory names.
> 
> - Forced Browsing: Attackers attempt to access restricted pages or files by **manipulating URL parameters** or by guessing common file names and extensions.
> - Directory Bursting: Attackers try to discover hidden directories by **iterating through a list of common directory names** or using wordlists to brute-force the directory structure.

> [!example] Discovering Hidden Admin Pages
>
> Suppose a web application has an admin panel located at `www.example.com/admin`. However, this admin panel is not linked from any public pages and is intended to be accessed only by authorized administrators.
>
> An attacker, suspecting the existence of an admin panel, may attempt forced browsing by manually entering common URLs such as:
> - `www.example.com/admin`
> - `www.example.com/administrator`
> - `www.example.com/admin.php`
> - `www.example.com/admin/dashboard`
>
> If any of these URLs are accessible without proper authorization checks, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the admin panel and can potentially perform privileged actions.

> [!example] Uncovering Sensitive Directories
>
> An attacker targeting a web server may attempt directory bursting to uncover hidden directories that could contain sensitive information. They may use a wordlist containing common directory names or variations, such as:
> - `/backups`
> - `/config`
> - `/data`
> - `/logs`
>
> By sending requests to these directories and analyzing the server's responses, the attacker can determine which directories exist on the server. If any of these directories are not properly secured, the attacker may gain access to sensitive files or configuration data.
