> [!idea]+ WiFi Security - Introduction
>
> WiFi security is crucial for protecting wireless networks and the data transmitted over them. There are several types of WiFi security protocols, each with varying levels of protection:
>
> 1. Open (no security)
> 2. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
> 3. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
> 4. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)
>
> The WiFi ecosystem consists of various devices, including:
> - RADIUS server for authentication and accounting
> - Wireless access points (WAPs) to create wireless networks
> - Client devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets) connecting to the network
>
> WiFi security standards are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, which has evolved over time to address vulnerabilities and improve security.

> [!example]+ Cracking WEP Passwords
>
> WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was the first encryption protocol used for securing WiFi networks. However, it has several weaknesses that make it relatively easy to crack.
>
> **Process:**
> 1. Capture a large amount of WEP-encrypted network traffic using a packet sniffer like Wireshark.
> 2. Use a tool like aircrack-ng to analyze the captured data and extract the WEP key.
> 
> WEP's vulnerabilities, such as weak initialization vectors (IVs) and the lack of strong encryption, make it possible to crack the encryption key in minutes, making it an insecure option for WiFi security.

> [!idea]+ WPA2 and the 4-Way Handshake
>
> WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) is a more secure protocol that addresses the weaknesses of WEP. It uses a 4-way handshake to establish a secure connection between the client and the access point.
>
> **4-Way Handshake Process:**
> 1. The client sends an authentication request to the access point.
> 2. The access point responds with a random number (ANonce).
> 3. The client generates another random number (SNonce) and combines it with the ANonce, the PMK (Pairwise Master Key), and other data to create the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key).
> 4. The client sends the SNonce and a MIC (Message Integrity Code) to the access point.
> 5. The access point verifies the MIC and sends a GTK (Group Temporal Key) to the client.
> 6. The client confirms the receipt of the GTK.
> 7. The access point sends a confirmation to the client, acknowledging the successful 4-way handshake.
> 8. The client and access point can now securely communicate using the established keys.


> [!example]+ WPA PSK Attacks
>
> WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 can operate in two modes: Personal (PSK) and Enterprise. In the PSK mode, a pre-shared key is used for authentication, which can be vulnerable to attacks.
>
> **Risks:**
> - Weak PSKs (e.g., short, easily guessable passwords) can be cracked through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
> - If an attacker obtains the PSK, they can gain unauthorized access to the network and decrypt the traffic.
>
> **Mitigations:**
> - Use strong, complex passwords for the PSK (at least 12 characters, mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
> - Implement additional security measures like MAC address filtering and hiding the SSID.
> - Regularly update the PSK and monitor for suspicious activity on the network.

> [!example]+ Dictionary Attacks on WPA2
>
> Dictionary attacks are a type of brute-force attack where an attacker uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords to guess the WPA2 PSK.
>
> **Process:**
> 1. Attacker captures the 4-way handshake between a client and the access point.
> 2. Attacker uses a tool like Aircrack-ng or Hashcat to run a dictionary attack on the captured handshake.
> 3. If the PSK is based on a weak, guessable password, the attacker can crack it and gain access to the network.
>
> **Mitigations:**
> - Use strong, randomly generated PSKs that are not based on dictionary words or common patterns.
> - Implement a password policy that requires users to create complex passwords and change them regularly.
> - Consider using WPA2 Enterprise with a RADIUS server for better access control and management.

> [!idea]+ Latest WiFi Security - WPA3
>
> WPA3 is the latest WiFi security protocol, designed to address the vulnerabilities in WPA2 and provide enhanced security features.
>
> **Key Improvements:**
> - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE): A more secure handshake that replaces the 4-way handshake in WPA2, providing better protection against offline dictionary attacks.
> - Forward secrecy: Ensures that even if an attacker obtains the PSK, they cannot decrypt previously captured traffic.
> - Enhanced open: Provides encryption for open networks, protecting users' privacy in public WiFi settings.
> - Easy Connect: Simplifies the process of configuring IoT devices securely.
>
> **Transitioning to WPA3:**
> - WPA3 is backward compatible with WPA2 devices, allowing for a smooth transition.
> - New devices are required to support WPA3, while existing devices can be updated with firmware upgrades.
> - WPA3 is expected to become the new standard for WiFi security in the coming years.
