> [!warning]+ TCP Reset (RST) Injection 
>
> TCP Reset injection is an attack where a malicious actor injects forged TCP Reset packets into an established connection to abruptly terminate it.
>
> **How it works:**
> 1. Attacker sniffs network traffic to identify active TCP connections and their sequence numbers
> 2. Attacker crafts a forged TCP packet with the RST flag set and a sequence number within the valid window 
> 3. Forged RST packet is sent to one or both endpoints, causing them to immediately terminate the connection
> 
> **Impact:**
> - Abrupt termination of TCP connections disrupts service availability
> - Can be used to interrupt transmissions at sensitive times, e.g. cutting off a large file download right before completion
>
> **Mitigations:**  
> - Implement encrypted protocols like SSL/TLS to prevent sniffing sequence numbers
> - Use TCP MD5 signature option to authenticate packets
> - Filter out external traffic with RST flag set at network perimeter

> [!danger]+ SYN Flooding DoS Attack
>
> SYN flooding is a denial-of-service attack that exploits the TCP three-way handshake process to overwhelm a target system with half-open connections, exhausting its resources.
>
> **Attack Process:**
> 1. Attacker sends a flood of SYN packets to the target server, often with spoofed source IP addresses
> 2. Server responds to each SYN with a SYN-ACK, allocating resources to hold the half-open connection 
> 3. Attacker never sends the final ACK, causing the server to maintain many half-open connections
> 4. As more malicious SYN requests are received, the server's connection queue fills up and it can no longer accept legitimate connections
>
> **Impact:**
> - Target system becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion 
> - Legitimate users are denied service as the server cannot process their connection requests
>
> **Mitigation Techniques:**
> - Implement SYN cookies to avoid storing connection state for half-open connections
> - Configure firewalls to limit the number of SYN packets from a single source
> - Enable TCP half-open connection logging and alerting to detect SYN flooding attempts
> - Scale up infrastructure to increase capacity to handle large SYN floods

I've focused the notes so far on TCP-based attacks as a starting point, covering the key topics of TCP Reset injection and SYN flooding in the format you requested. Let me know if you would like me to expand on the other topics mentioned like DDoS and amplified denial of service attacks as well. I'm happy to provide further notes and examples to aid your understanding of these network security concepts.
