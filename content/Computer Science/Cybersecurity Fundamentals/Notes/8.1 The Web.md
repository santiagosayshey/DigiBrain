> [!idea] Overview of the Web
>
> The web is a **collection of interconnected documents and resources**, accessible over the internet using a web browser.
> - Web servers: Computers that store and **serve web pages** and resources.
> - Web browsers: Software applications used to access and **view web pages**.
> ![[client-server-architecture.png]]
>
> This diagram should illustrate the interaction between web browsers and web servers. It should show:
> 1. A user's computer with a web browser
> 2. The internet, represented by a cloud or a network of connected devices
> 3. A web server
> 4. Arrows indicating the flow of requests from the browser to the server and responses from the server back to the browser

> [!idea] Anatomy of a URL
>
> - Definition of URL: A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a unique address used to locate and access resources on the web.
> - Parts of a URL:
>   - Scheme: Indicates the protocol used (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS)
>   - Domain: Identifies the web server hosting the resource
>   - Path: Specifies the location of the resource on the web server
>   - Query parameters: Optional key-value pairs used to pass data to the server
>
> ![[URL Breakdown.png]]
>
> This image should show a sample URL (e.g., https://www.example.com/page?id=1&name=John) and break it down into its components:
> 1. Scheme: https://
> 2. Domain: www.example.com
> 3. Path: /page
> 4. Query parameters: ?id=1&name=John

> [!example] Dissecting a complex URL with query parameters
>
> Let's dissect the following URL:
> https://www.google.com/search?q=web+development&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
>
> - Scheme: https://
> - Domain: www.google.com
> - Path: /search
> - Query parameters:
>   - q=web+development
>   - sourceid=chrome
>   - ie=UTF-8
>
> This URL is used to perform a search on Google for the term "web development" using the Chrome browser with UTF-8 encoding.
