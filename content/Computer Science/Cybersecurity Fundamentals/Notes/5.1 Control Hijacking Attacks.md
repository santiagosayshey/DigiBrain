> [!idea]+ Hijacking Attacks
> Hijacking attacks **attempt to take over the target machine, often by exploiting vulnerabilities** to execute arbitrary code and disrupt the normal application control flow.
>
> Examples of memory-based hijacking attacks include:
> - Buffer overflow and integer overflow attacks
> - Format string vulnerabilities 
> - Use-after-free vulnerabilities
>
> Some notable examples of hijacking attacks from history:
> - The Morris Worm (1988) exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability to spread itself
> - The Code Red worm (2001) exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's IIS Server, causing billions in damages
> - Heartbleed (2014) was a vulnerability in OpenSSL that allowed reading private memory contents
> - The Glibc "GHOST" vulnerability (2015) was a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C library
>  
> Here's an example of an integer overflow vulnerability:
>
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
> int main() {
>     char command;
>     unsigned char c = 5;
>     while (1) {
>         printf("The current value is %d\n", c);
>         printf("Up(u) or down(d)?\n");
>         command = getchar();
>         if (command == 'u')
>             c = c + 1;
>         else if (command == 'd') 
>             c = c - 1;
>     }
>     return 0;
> }
> ```

> This code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. Incrementing the unsigned char `c` past its maximum value of 255 will cause it to wrap around to 0.

> [!consider]+ What You Need to Understand Control Hijacking Exploits
> Understanding and developing control hijacking exploits requires a **strong foundation in several technical areas**. Some of the key knowledge areas include:
>
> - **Concrete understanding of computer architecture**, including:
>   - The stack and heap memory layouts 
>   - How details vary slightly between CPUs and OSs (stack frame structure, endianness, etc.)
> - Knowing how the system makes **function calls** and the role of the `exec()` **system call**
> - Familiarity with the **programming languages** (C, etc.) and **compilers** used to build the target software
> - Understanding the different **code representations**, from:
>   - High-level source code
>   - Bytecode/CIL
>   - Low-level machine code that the CPU executes 
>
> Ultimately, **exploits happen at the machine code level**, so a strong grasp of low-level details is essential to discovering and taking advantage of vulnerabilities.
