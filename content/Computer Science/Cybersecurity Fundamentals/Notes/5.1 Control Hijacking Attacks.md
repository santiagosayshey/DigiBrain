> Hijacking attacks **attempt to take over the target machine, often by exploiting vulnerabilities** to execute arbitrary code and disrupt the normal application control flow.
>
> Examples of memory-based hijacking attacks include:
> - Buffer overflow and integer overflow attacks
> - Format string vulnerabilities 
> - Use-after-free vulnerabilities
>
> Some notable examples of hijacking attacks from history:
> - The Morris Worm (1988) exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability to spread itself
> - The Code Red worm (2001) exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's IIS Server, causing billions in damages
> - Heartbleed (2014) was a vulnerability in OpenSSL that allowed reading private memory contents
> - The Glibc "GHOST" vulnerability (2015) was a heap-based buffer overflow in the GNU C library
>  
> Here's an example of an integer overflow vulnerability:
>
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
> int main() {
>     char command;
>     unsigned char c = 5;
>     while (1) {
>         printf("The current value is %d\n", c);
>         printf("Up(u) or down(d)?\n");
>         command = getchar();
>         if (command == 'u')
>             c = c + 1;
>         else if (command == 'd') 
>             c = c - 1;
>     }
>     return 0;
> }

> This code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. Incrementing the unsigned char `c` past its maximum value of 255 will cause it to wrap around to 0.

> [!consider]+ What You Need to Understand Control Hijacking Exploits
> Understanding and developing control hijacking exploits requires a **strong foundation in several technical areas**. Some of the key knowledge areas include:
>
> - **Concrete understanding of computer architecture**, including:
>   - The stack and heap memory layouts 
>   - How details vary slightly between CPUs and OSs (stack frame structure, endianness, etc.)
> - Knowing how the system makes **function calls** and the role of the `exec()` **system call**
> - Familiarity with the **programming languages** (C, etc.) and **compilers** used to build the target software
> - Understanding the different **code representations**, from:
>   - High-level source code
>   - Bytecode/CIL
>   - Low-level machine code that the CPU executes 
>
> Ultimately, **exploits happen at the machine code level**, so a strong grasp of low-level details is essential to discovering and taking advantage of vulnerabilities.


> [!idea]+ Program Execution on the Von Neumann Architecture
> The Von Neumann architecture is the foundation of modern computing. Here's how programs are executed:
> 
> 1. The compiled program's instructions are loaded into **memory**
> 2. The **CPU** fetches the next instruction pointed to by the **instruction pointer**
> 3. The instruction is decoded and executed by the CPU's control and logic units
> 4. Data operands are fetched from memory as needed
> 5. Results may be written back to memory or sent to **output**
> 6. The instruction pointer is updated to the next instruction and the cycle repeats
>
> Let's look at a simple program in memory and how it executes:
>
> | Address | Instruction |
> |---------|-------------|
> | 001     | `main():`   |
> | 002     | `  wake_up` |
> | 003     | `  drink_coffee` |
> | 004     | `  play_games` |
> | 005     | `  eat_toast` |
> | ...     | ...         |
> | 013     | `sleep()`   |
>
> Now let's see how function calls work using the stack:
>
> | Instruction | Description |
> |-------------|-------------|
> | `push()`    | Push current instruction pointer on stack |
> | `push(egs)` | Push registers on stack to save state |
> | `jmp cook() | Jump to `cook()` function instructions |
> | ...         | Execute `cook()` function's code         | 
> | `pop(egs)`  | Restore registers from stack |
> | `ret`       | Return to caller by popping instruction pointer |
>
> The **stack** stores the state to resume execution after the function `cook()` returns.


> [!idea]+ Process Memory Layout and Variable Storage
>
> A process's memory is divided into several segments, each serving a specific purpose. Let's look at some code to see which kinds of variables are stored where:
>
> ```c
> int g = 42;                  /* DATA (global variable) */
>
> int main() {    
>    static int s = 123;       /* DATA (static variable) */
>    char *p = malloc(10);     /* HEAP (dynamically allocated) */
>    char a[] = "abc";         /* STACK (local variable) */
>    
>    func1();                  /* STACK (return address, parameters) */
> }  
>
> void func1() {
>    int x = 3;                /* STACK (local variable) */
>    char *p = malloc(1024);   /* HEAP (dynamically allocated) */
>    func2(x, p);              /* STACK (return address, parameters) */
>    free(p);                  /* Deallocate HEAP memory */
> }
>
> void func2(int a, char *b) {  
>    /* Function parameters a and b are on the STACK */
>    char buf[512];            /* STACK (local variable) */
>    strcpy(buf, b);           /* Potential STACK overflow! */ 
> }
> ```
>
> To summarize:
> - **STACK**: Local variables, function parameters, return addresses 
> - **HEAP**: Dynamically allocated memory via `malloc()`, `new`, etc.
> - **DATA**: Global and static variables
> - **TEXT**: Executable program instructions (code)
>
> The stack is also used for:
> 1. Expression evaluation, e.g. `(1 + 2) * (3 + 4)`  
> 2. Passing function parameters and storing local variables
>
> Crucially, the stack grows downwards from high to low memory addresses. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if input is not properly validated before storing it in a stack variable, such as the `strcpy()` in `func2()` above.

> [!consider]+ Stack Usage and Function Calling Convention Example
>
> Let's analyze how the stack is used when calling functions in this code:
> ```c
> int main() {
>     return add_9(10);   
> }
>
> int add_9(int n) {
>     int x;
>     x = 9;
>     return func2(n, 9);
> }
>
> int add(int x, int y) {
>     int z;
>     z = x + y;
>     return z; 
> }
> ```
>
> When `main()` calls `add_9(10)`, the stack looks like this:
> 
> | Stack | Notes |
> |-------|-------|
> | arg1 = 10 | Parameter `n` pushed for `add_9()` |
> | return addr | Return address to `main()` |
> | prev frame ptr | Previous frame pointer |
> | int x | Local variable `x` in `add_9()` |
>
> Then `add_9()` calls `func2(n, 9)`, resulting in:
>
> | Stack | Notes |
> |-------|-------|
> | arg2 = 9 | Second parameter to `add()` |  
> | arg1 = 10 | First parameter `x` to `add()` |
> | return addr | Return address to `add_9()` | 
> | prev frame ptr | Previous frame pointer |
> | int x | Local variable `x` in `add_9()` |
> | arg1 = 10 | Parameter `n` for `add_9()` |
> | return addr | Return address to `main()` |
> | prev frame ptr | Previous frame pointer |
>
> Inside `add()`:

> | Stack | Notes |
> |-------|-------|
> | int z | Local variable `z` in `add()` |
> | arg2 = 9 | Second parameter `y` to `add()` |
> | arg1 = 10 | First parameter `x` to `add()` |
> | return addr | Return address to `add_9()` |
> | prev frame ptr | Previous frame pointer |
> | int x | Local variable `x` in `add_9()` |
> | arg1 = 10 | Parameter `n` for `add_9()` |
> | return addr | Return address to `main()` |
> | prev frame ptr | Previous frame pointer |
>  
> Some key points:
> - Parameters are pushed right-to-left
> - The return address is pushed by the `call` instruction 
> - The frame pointer is used to reference parameters and locals
> - Local variables are allocated by subtracting from the stack pointer
> - The stack grows downward from high to low addresses
>
> This example illustrates how the stack enables passing parameters, allocating local storage, and controlling the execution flow between functions.
