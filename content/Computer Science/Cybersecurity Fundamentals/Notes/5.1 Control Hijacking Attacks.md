> [!idea]+ Hijacking Attacks
> Hijacking attacks **attempt to take over the target machine, often by exploiting vulnerabilities** to execute arbitrary code and disrupt the normal application control flow.

> Examples of memory-based hijacking attacks include:
> - Buffer overflow and integer overflow attacks 
> - Format string vulnerabilities
> - Use-after-free vulnerabilities
>
> Here's an example of an integer overflow vulnerability:
> 
> ```c
> #include <stdio.h>
> int main() {
>     char command;
>     unsigned char c = 5;
>     while (1) {
>         printf("The current value is %d\n", c);
>         printf("Up(u) or down(d)?\n");
>         command = getchar();
>         if (command == 'u') 
>             c = c + 1;
>         else if (command == 'd')
>             c = c - 1; 
>     }
>     return 0;
> }
> ```

> This code is vulnerable to an integer overflow attack. Incrementing the unsigned char `c` past its maximum value of 255 will cause it to wrap around to 0.
