> 
> In the modern digital landscape, **organisations face increasing threats from cyber-attacks** and data breaches. These incidents can cause significant financial and reputational damage. **Effective incident response and digital forensics are crucial to mitigate these impacts** and ensure organizational security.

> [!idea] Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
> 
> Digital forensics involves the **identification, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence**. Incident response refers to the **organized approach to managing and addressing the aftermath of a cyber-attack**. Together, DFIR helps organizations respond to incidents effectively and recover from cyber-attacks.
> 
> The digital forensics process typically includes several phases:
> - **Identification**: Recognizing and determining the scope of the incident.
> - **Preservation**: Ensuring that the digital evidence is protected and not altered.
> - **Analysis**: Examining the evidence to understand the incident and identify the perpetrators.
> - **Documentation**: Recording the findings and maintaining a chain of custody.
> - **Presentation**: Presenting the evidence in a clear and understandable manner, often in legal proceedings.
> 
> Digital forensics encompasses various areas, including:
> - **Computer Forensics**: Investigating digital devices such as computers and laptops.
> - **Network Forensics**: Analyzing network traffic and logs to detect and respond to incidents.
> - **Mobile Device Forensics**: Examining smartphones and tablets for evidence.
> - **Cloud Forensics**: Investigating data stored in cloud environments.
> - **Malware Forensics**: Analyzing malicious software to understand its behavior and impact.

> [!example] Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)
> 
> A Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) is a **group of professionals tasked with responding to and managing cybersecurity incidents**. CIRTs handle incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities, ensuring a comprehensive response to cyber threats.

> [!consider] CTF vs. Real World
> 
> Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions simulate real-world cyber-attack scenarios for training and skill development. While CTFs provide valuable experience, real-world incident response requires handling complex and unpredictable situations, often under significant pressure and with higher stakes.

> [!idea] Logs and Log Analysis
> 
> Logs are essential in digital forensics as they provide a record of activities and events on a system or network. Analyzing logs helps investigators understand what happened, how it happened, and who was involved. Common types of logs include system logs, application logs, and network logs.
> 
> Consider a sample log file from a web server:
> 
> ```
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:45 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:46 +0000] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2326
> 192.168.1.2 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:47 +0000] "GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1" 302 -
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:48 +0000] "GET /error HTTP/1.1" 404 512
> ```
> 
> - **192.168.1.1** accessed the main page and then attempted to log in.
> - **192.168.1.2** attempted to access the dashboard but was redirected.
> - The 404 error indicates an attempt to access a non-existent page.
> 
> By analyzing these logs, investigators can trace user actions, identify anomalies, and detect potential security incidents.

> [!idea] Forensic Tools and Network Forensics
> 
> Various tools assist forensic investigators in working with files, such as:
> - **FTK (Forensic Toolkit)**: Comprehensive suite for data analysis and evidence collection.
> - **EnCase**: Tool for acquiring, analyzing, and reporting on digital evidence.
> - **Autopsy**: Open-source digital forensics platform for disk analysis and data recovery.
> 
> Network forensics involves capturing, recording, and analyzing network packets and logs to detect and investigate network-based incidents. Key aspects include:
> - **Packet Traces**: Capturing and examining raw network packets to identify malicious activity.
> - **Network Logs**: Analyzing logs from firewalls, routers, and intrusion detection systems to trace the attacker's actions and timeline.
