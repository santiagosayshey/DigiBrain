> 
> In the modern digital landscape, **organisations face increasing threats from cyber-attacks** and data breaches. These incidents can cause significant financial and reputational damage. **Effective incident response and digital forensics are crucial to mitigate these impacts** and ensure organizational security.

> [!idea] Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
> 
> Digital forensics involves the **identification, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence**. Incident response refers to the **organized approach to managing and addressing the aftermath of a cyber-attack**. Together, DFIR helps organizations respond to incidents effectively and recover from cyber-attacks.
> 
> The digital forensics process typically includes several phases:
> - **Identification**: Recognizing and determining the scope of the incident.
> - **Preservation**: Ensuring that the digital evidence is protected and not altered.
> - **Analysis**: Examining the evidence to understand the incident and identify the perpetrators.
> - **Documentation**: Recording the findings and maintaining a chain of custody.
> - **Presentation**: Presenting the evidence in a clear and understandable manner, often in legal proceedings.
> 
> Digital forensics encompasses various areas, including:
> - **Computer Forensics**: Investigating digital devices such as computers and laptops.
> - **Network Forensics**: Analyzing network traffic and logs to detect and respond to incidents.
> - **Mobile Device Forensics**: Examining smartphones and tablets for evidence.
> - **Cloud Forensics**: Investigating data stored in cloud environments.
> - **Malware Forensics**: Analyzing malicious software to understand its behavior and impact.

> [!consider] Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)
> 
> A Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT) is a **group of professionals tasked with responding to and managing cybersecurity incidents**. CIRTs handle incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities, ensuring a comprehensive response to cyber threats.

> [!example] Logs and Log Analysis
> 
> Logs are essential in digital forensics as they **provide a record of activities and events on a system or network**. Analyzing logs helps investigators understand **what happened, how it happened, and who was involved**. Common types of logs include system logs, application logs, and network logs.
> 
> Consider a sample log file from a web server:
> 
> ```
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:45 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:46 +0000] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2326
> 192.168.1.2 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:47 +0000] "GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1" 302 -
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:48 +0000] "GET /admin HTTP/1.1" 200 512
> 192.168.1.1 - - [12/May/2024:14:23:49 +0000] "GET /error HTTP/1.1" 404 512
> ```
> 
> - **192.168.1.1** accessed the main page and then attempted to log in.
> - **192.168.1.2** attempted to access the dashboard but was redirected.
> - **192.168.1.1** accessed the `/admin` page, which should be restricted to admins only.
> - The 404 error indicates an attempt to access a non-existent page.
> 
> In this case, the log reveals that **192.168.1.1** accessed a restricted admin page, suggesting that the user may have used **directory bursting or forced browsing** to bypass security measures. This indicates a security flaw that needs to be addressed to prevent unauthorized access in the future.

> [!idea] Forensic Tools
> 
> Various tools assist forensic investigators in working with files. Here are some key tools and their commands, along with explanations of their purposes and usefulness:
> 
> | **Command** | **Explanation** | **Usefulness** |
> |---------|-------------|------------|
> | `$ file screenshot.png` | Uses the `file` utility to determine the type of a file based on its content, rather than its extension. It identifies file types using "magic bytes," which are specific patterns at the beginning of files. | Quickly identify and categorize files, especially when extensions may have been tampered with. |
> | `$ dd if=/file_with_a_file_in_it.xxx of=./extracted_file.xxx bs=1 skip=1335205 count=40668937` | The `dd` command is used for low-level copying of data. In this context, it extracts a specific portion of a file by specifying the byte range (`skip` and `count`). | Useful in recovering deleted files or extracting embedded files from a larger data set. |
> | `$ strings -o screenshot.png` | The `strings` command searches for and prints printable character sequences within a file. | Quickly identify human-readable text within binary files, such as metadata, error messages, or embedded URLs. |
> | `$ hexdump -n 50 -e "0x%08x " screenshot.png` | The `hexdump` command displays the binary data of a file in a hexadecimal format. | Examine the raw data within a file, allowing investigators to detect patterns or anomalies that may indicate tampering or hidden information. |
> | `$ exiftool screenshot.png` | The `exiftool` command reads and writes metadata information in files, particularly images. | Metadata can provide critical information about a file, such as creation date, modification history, and camera settings, which can be crucial in an investigation. |

> [!idea] Packet Traces
> 
> Packet traces involve capturing and examining raw network packets to identify malicious activity. Tools like Wireshark are commonly used for this purpose.

> Example:

> ```plaintext
> No.     Time           Source                Destination           Protocol Length Info
>       1 0.000000000   192.168.1.100         192.168.1.1           TCP      74     4369 → 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=123456789 TSecr=0 WS=128

> ```
> 
> In this example, packet 1 shows an initial SYN request from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.1. Packet 2 is the SYN-ACK response from the server, and packet 3 is the ACK from the client, completing the TCP handshake.

> [!idea] Network Logs
> 
> Network logs are records of activities on network devices such as firewalls, routers, and intrusion detection systems. These logs help trace the attacker's actions and timeline.
> 
> Example of a firewall log:

> ```plaintext
> May 12 14:23:45 firewall01 kernel: [UFW BLOCK] IN=eth0 OUT= MAC=00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e:6f SRC=192.168.1.100 DST=192.168.1.1 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=54321 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=4369 DPT=80 WINDOW=64240 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
