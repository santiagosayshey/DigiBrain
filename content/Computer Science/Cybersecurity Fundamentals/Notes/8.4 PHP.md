>
> PHP is used to create **dynamic websites**. When a user visits a website, PHP can customize the page content you see based on factors like the **time of day, your user preferences, or data you've entered.** PHP is commonly used for forms, generating web pages from database information, and creating user-specific pages like dashboards. It is an integral part of many websites you might use daily, like WordPress, which relies on PHP to manage content and interact with its database effectively.

> [!example] Lifecycle of a PHP Script Fetching Data from an API
>
> This example demonstrates how PHP can be used to dynamically generate HTML content by retrieving information from an API. Here, PHP fetches a user's name from an API and displays a personalized greeting.
>
> ```html
> <!-- This is a simple PHP web page that interacts with an API -->
> <html>
> <head>
>     <title>PHP API Interaction Example</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <?php
>         // Simulated API request to fetch a user's name
>         $userName = file_get_contents("https://api.example.com/getUserName?id=12345");
>         echo "Hello, " . $userName . "! Welcome back.";
>     ?>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> In this example:
> 1. The browser requests the PHP page.
> 2. The server runs the PHP script, which includes making an API call to retrieve the user's name.
> 3. The PHP script processes the API response and embeds the name into the HTML content.
> 4. The server sends back the resulting HTML with the personalized greeting.
> 5. The browser displays the HTML, now containing the dynamic content based on the API data.

> [!example] Example of Unsafe PHP Code
>
> A common security vulnerability in PHP arises from improperly handling user input, which can lead to injection attacks. Hereâ€™s an example of unsafe PHP code:
> ```php
> <html>
> <body>
>     <form method="post">
>         Enter your name: <input type="text" name="name">
>         <input type="submit" value="Submit">
>     </form>
>     <?php
>         if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
>             // The following line is unsafe because it directly echoes user input without validation or escaping.
>             echo "Hello, " . $_POST['name'] . "!";
>         }
>     ?>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> In this scenario, echoing user input directly without sanitizing it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A malicious user could enter JavaScript code into the form, which would then be executed by the browser when echoed by the PHP script.
