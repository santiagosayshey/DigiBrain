It looks like the issue arises from how Markdown interprets the `>` character in the context of a blockquote when used within code blocks. This is causing it to treat lines as continuations of the blockquote, which is not the intention here. To correctly format the content, we can use HTML entities to represent the `>` character, which is `&gt;` for greater-than in HTML. Here's how you can adjust the examples:

> [!example] Lifecycle of a PHP Script
>
> Understanding how PHP integrates and functions within a web page can clarify its role:
> ```html
> <!-- This is a simple PHP web page -->
> &lt;html&gt;
> &lt;head&gt;
>     &lt;title&gt;PHP Example&lt;/title&gt;
> &lt;/head&gt;
> &lt;body&gt;
>     &lt;?php
>         echo "Today's date is " . date("Y-m-d") . ".";
>         // This PHP code generates dynamic content, which is the current date.
>     ?&gt;
> &lt;/body&gt;
> &lt;/html&gt;
> ```
> In this example:
> 1. The browser requests the PHP page.
> 2. The server processes the PHP code, replacing it with the output.
> 3. The server sends back the resulting HTML.
> 4. The browser displays the HTML, now containing dynamic content generated by PHP.

> [!example] Example of Unsafe PHP Code
>
> A common security vulnerability in PHP arises from improperly handling user input, which can lead to injection attacks. Hereâ€™s an example of unsafe PHP code:
> ```php
> &lt;html&gt;
> &lt;body&gt;
>     &lt;form method="post"&gt;
>         Enter your name: &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;
>         &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
>     &lt;/form&gt;
>     &lt;?php
>         if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
>             // The following line is unsafe because it directly echoes user input without validation or escaping.
>             echo "Hello, " . $_POST['name'] . "!";
>         }
>     ?&gt;
> &lt;/body&gt;
> &lt;/html&gt;
> ```
> In this scenario, echoing user input directly without sanitizing it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A malicious user could enter JavaScript code into the form, which would then be executed by the browser when echoed by the PHP script.

This should ensure that the HTML tags are displayed correctly in your Markdown environment and aren't mistaken for Markdown blockquote syntax.
