> [!example] Lifecycle of a PHP Script
>
> Understanding how PHP integrates and functions within a web page can clarify its role:
> ```html
> <!-- This is a simple PHP web page -->
> <html>
> <head>
>     <title>PHP Example</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <?php
>         echo "Today's date is " . date("Y-m-d") . ".";
>         // This PHP code generates dynamic content, which is the current date.
>     ?>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> In this example:
> 1. The browser requests the PHP page.
> 2. The server processes the PHP code, replacing it with the output.
> 3. The server sends back the resulting HTML.
> 4. The browser displays the HTML, now containing dynamic content generated by PHP.

> [!example] Example of Unsafe PHP Code
>
> A common security vulnerability in PHP arises from improperly handling user input, which can lead to injection attacks. Hereâ€™s an example of unsafe PHP code:
> ```php
> <html>
> <body>
>     <form method="post">
>         Enter your name: <input type="text" name="name">
>         <input type="submit" value="Submit">
>     </form>
>     <?php
>         if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
>             // The following line is unsafe because it directly echoes user input without validation or escaping.
>             echo "Hello, " . $_POST['name'] . "!";
>         }
>     ?>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> In this scenario, echoing user input directly without sanitizing it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A malicious user could enter JavaScript code into the form, which would then be executed by the browser when echoed by the PHP script.

For Markdown specifically within Obsidian or similar software, ensuring that no additional formatting, such as unnecessary spaces or tab characters, precedes the triple backticks (```) of your code block could also be important. Make sure these backticks are aligned to the very beginning of the line without any preceding whitespace. If the issue persists, it may be specific to how Obsidian parses the combination of callouts and code blocks, requiring further exploration of Obsidian-specific syntax or settings adjustments.
