Certainly! In Obsidian, when embedding HTML within a markdown code block inside a callout, the `>` characters need to be escaped to ensure they are rendered correctly. Here's the adjusted content with escaped characters for the PHP examples:

> [!idea] What is PHP and its Role in Web Development
>
> PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that is embedded directly into HTML. It enables dynamic and interactive web pages by executing scripts on the server that generate HTML content before sending it to the client. PHP can manage everything from small forms to complex business processes, and it integrates seamlessly with various databases, making it a cornerstone of modern web applications like WordPress and Facebook.

> [!example] Lifecycle of a PHP Script
>
> Understanding how PHP integrates and functions within a web page can clarify its role:
> \```html
> \<!-- This is a simple PHP web page -->
> \<html>
> \<head>
>     \<title>PHP Example\</title>
> \</head>
> \<body>
>     \<?php
>         echo "Today's date is " . date("Y-m-d") . ".";
>         // This PHP code generates dynamic content, which is the current date.
>     ?>
> \</body>
> \</html>
> \```
> In this example:
> 1. The browser requests the PHP page.
> 2. The server processes the PHP code, replacing it with the output.
> 3. The server sends back the resulting HTML.
> 4. The browser displays the HTML, now containing dynamic content generated by PHP.

> [!example] Example of Unsafe PHP Code
>
> A common security vulnerability in PHP arises from improperly handling user input, which can lead to injection attacks. Hereâ€™s an example of unsafe PHP code:
> \```php
> \<html>
> \<body>
>     \<form method="post">
>         Enter your name: \<input type="text" name="name">
>         \<input type="submit" value="Submit">
>     \</form>
>     \<?php
>         if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
>             // The following line is unsafe because it directly echoes user input without validation or escaping.
>             echo "Hello, " . $_POST['name'] . "!";
>         }
>     ?>
> \</body>
> \</html>
> \```
> In this scenario, echoing user input directly without sanitizing it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A malicious user could enter JavaScript code into the form, which would then be executed by the browser when echoed by the PHP script.

This formatting should help avoid any parsing issues in Obsidian when displaying HTML content within markdown code blocks.
