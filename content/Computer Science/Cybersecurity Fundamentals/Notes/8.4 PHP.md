> PHP is used to create **dynamic websites**. When a user visits a website, PHP can customize the page content you see based on factors like the **time of day, your user preferences, or data you've entered.** PHP is commonly used for forms, generating web pages from database information, and creating user-specific pages like dashboards. It is an integral part of many websites you might use daily, like WordPress, which relies on PHP to manage content and interact with its database effectively.

> [!example] Lifecycle of a PHP Script
>
>
> ```html
> <!-- This is a simple PHP web page -->
> <html>
> <head>
>     <title>PHP Example</title>
> </head>
> <body>
>     <?php
>         echo "Today's date is " . date("Y-m-d") . ".";
>         // This PHP code generates dynamic content, which is the current date.
>     ?>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> In this example:
> 1. The browser requests the PHP page.
> 2. The server processes the PHP code, replacing it with the output.
> 3. The server sends back the resulting HTML.
> 4. The browser displays the HTML, now containing dynamic content generated by PHP.

> [!example] Example of Unsafe PHP Code
>
> A common security vulnerability in PHP arises from improperly handling user input, which can lead to injection attacks. Hereâ€™s an example of unsafe PHP code:
> ```php
> <html>
> <body>
>     <form method="post">
>         Enter your name: <input type="text" name="name">
>         <input type="submit" value="Submit">
>     </form>
>     <?php
>         if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
>             // The following line is unsafe because it directly echoes user input without validation or escaping.
>             echo "Hello, " . $_POST['name'] . "!";
>         }
>     ?>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```
> In this scenario, echoing user input directly without sanitizing it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. A malicious user could enter JavaScript code into the form, which would then be executed by the browser when echoed by the PHP script.
