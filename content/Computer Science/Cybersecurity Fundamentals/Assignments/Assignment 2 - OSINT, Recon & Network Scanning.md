> Google dorks are good at finding vulnerabilities in websites. Do a quick research for the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a product called Calcium by Brown Bear Software (you will learn about XSS in subsequent modules). What google search would you perform to find websites running Calcium? Perform the search, and paste a screenshot of the results.
> 
> **Answer:**
> A Google search for `site:www.exploit-db.com calcium xss` returns this page on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31858) as the first result. The page reveals that Calcium is prone to cross script scripting because the `CalenderName` inside the URL is not properly sanitised.

> Use the `whois_pocs` module in recon-ng to list some contacts for x.com. Who is located in Carson, CA?}
> 
> **Answer:**
>
> ```shell
> [recon-ng][assignment2][whois_pocs] > options set SOURCE x.com
> SOURCE => x.com
> [recon-ng][assignment2][whois_pocs] > run
>

> [*] --------------------------------------------------
> [*] URL: http://whois.arin.net/rest/poc/RNO51-ARIN
> [*] Country: United States
> [*] Email: x@x.com
> [*] First_Name: Robert
> [*] Last_Name: Nordland
> [*] Middle_Name: None
> [*] Notes: None
> [*] Phone: None
> [*] Region: Carson, CA
> [*] Title: Whois contact
> ```
>
> **Explanation:** Using the `whois_pocs` module in Recon-ng I was able to find points of contact associated with the domain `x.com`. By setting the source to x.com and running the module, it retrieves contact information from WHOIS records, finding information related to the domain. The process identifies **Robert Nordland**, located in Carson, CA, as a contact.

> I adjusted the existing script by specifying a dictionary file, `dnsmap.txt`, and targeting the `adelaide.edu.au` domain for DNS brute-forcing. The script reads through each line of the dictionary, attempting to resolve each subdomain against the specified domain. If a resolution is successful, it prints out the fully qualified domain name along with its IP address.
