> [!exercise] Exercise 1 - CSRF Token Stealing
>
> When on the high-security setting of DVWA, a unique ANTI-CSRF token is created each time the password change page is accessed, as shown in the workshop. To launch a CSRF attack in this case, we first need to steal the token. Create an HTML (name it: 'csrf.html') file that can steal the token from the DVWA CSRF page `http://[hacklabvm_ip]/DVWA/vulnerabilities/csrf` and change the password to 'csf2024s1'. You can use the template [here](https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/95262/files/14817144?wrap=1 "csrf.html"). Show the content of your csrf.html file.

> **q1. [2 points]** Download this [binary](https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/95262/files/14689600/download?download_frd=1). You can run it as `./q1` in Linux. You are not allowed to patch this program. Use Ghidra, Cutter, or Radare2 (or something else) to decompile and deduce the password required for revealing the secret. Get the program to print the secret.

> **q3. [2 points]** Download this [binary](https://myuni.adelaide.edu.au/courses/95262/files/14689603/download?download_frd=1). You can run it as `./q3` in Linux. You should patch this program to get it to reveal the secret using Ghidra/Cutter/Radare2 (as per workshop, Cutter is easiest, but feel free to use any program). Use the modified (patched) program to print the secret.
