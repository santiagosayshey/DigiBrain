In this course, you will be introduced to real-world cybersecurity challenges that organisations face, and learn to apply knowledge and skills gained through other Computer Science courses to address them. The challenges will be examined both from the attacker's perspective (how systems are exploited) and the defender's perspectives (how to secure systems or respond to threats). Common attack and defence strategies for software, web applications, networks, operating systems, cryptographic systems and humans will be explored. The course will also introduce cybersecurity management concepts, including security operations, risk management, security engineering and security architecture, as well as provide guidance on different career paths specialising in cybersecurity. We will also discuss the legal and ethical aspects of information security. This course focuses on hands-on activities, and students are encouraged to participate in public and industry cybersecurity challenges, including capture-the-flag competitions.
