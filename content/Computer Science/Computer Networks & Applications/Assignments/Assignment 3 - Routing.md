### **Part 2** **(_PG only_):** **Link State Algorithm Advanced Form (50 marks)**

The second part of the assignment is to write a second version of the program that is the same as the first, except that network is stored in a data structure with _**log(n)**_ performance for all relevant operations. This will require small modifications to your  `Dijkstra` program. 

The modified Dijkstra's algorithm program you are to provide should be named `DijkstraNlogN`. **This part is for postgraduate students only.**
