> You have a network `115.64.4.0/22` that you want to create subnets on. The subnets need to support up to 60 hosts each. How many bits would you allocate for the host part of the subnets? How many such subnets can you support? 
> 
> **Answer:**
> We have 10 bits left after the network is assigned. That's $2^10$ total hosts. Since each subnet needs 60 hosts each, we simply divide that number by 60 to get the maximum number of subnets available (rounded down)
