> Assume in your Wireshark capture that all three files could be accessed from the same server. 
> - The first web page takes 300 ms to download 
> - The first image takes 2 seconds to download 
> - The second image takes 300 milliseconds to download 
> - It takes 300 milliseconds to establish a TCP connection between the client and the server. 
> - The time taken to sent a request to the web server is 150 milliseconds
>   
> How many seconds would be saved downloading this web page by using a persistent connection (without pipelining) compared to using neither persistence nor pipelining?
