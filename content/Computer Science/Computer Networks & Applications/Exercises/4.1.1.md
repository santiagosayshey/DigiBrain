>
 When a host receives a UDP segment, it performs the following steps for connectionless demultiplexing:
> 1. The host checks the destination IP address and port number in the segment.
> 2. It then directs the UDP segment to the socket that is bound to the specific (IP, port) combination.
>
> Recall that when creating a datagram socket to send UDP packets, you must specify the destination IP address and port number.
>
> For UDP datagrams with the same destination (IP, port) but different source IP addresses and/or port numbers, they will still be directed to the same socket at the destination host.
