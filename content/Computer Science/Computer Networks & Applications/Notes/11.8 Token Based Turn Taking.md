> [!idea] Polling MAC Protocols

> In polling protocols, a **central controller regulates access to the shared channel by polling nodes in a specific order**. Each polled node is granted exclusive permission to transmit data during its allocated time slot. This approach **ensures only one node transmits at a time, eliminating collisions**.


> [!consider] Analogy to a Real-World Scenario
>
> Imagine a group of people sitting in a circle, and a beanbag being passed around. **Only the person holding the beanbag (central controller's polling message) is allowed to speak (transmit data)**. **When they are done, they pass the beanbag (polling message) to the next person in the circle** (predetermined sequence). This person then has the exclusive right to speak until they pass the beanbag along. The process continues in this round-robin fashion, ensuring only one person speaks at a time without interruptions or collisions.


> [!example] Illustration of Polling MAC Protocol
>
> Consider a network with a central controller and four nodes (A, B, C, D). The polling process may unfold as follows:
>
> 1. The controller sends a polling message to Node A.
> 2. Node A transmits its data frames (if any) during its allocated time slot. 
> 3. After Node A's transmission window expires, the controller sends a polling message to Node B.
> 4. Node B transmits its data frames (if any) during its allocated time slot.
> 5. The process repeats, with the controller polling Nodes C and D in sequence.
> 6. Once all nodes have been polled, the controller starts a new polling cycle, repeating the process indefinitely.
