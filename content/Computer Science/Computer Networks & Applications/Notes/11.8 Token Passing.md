> [!idea] Token Passing MAC Protocols
>
> In token passing protocols, **nodes are organized in a logical ring**. A special control message called a "token" is passed sequentially from node to node in the ring. **The node holding the token has exclusive permission to transmit data** over the shared channel. After completing its transmission or after a predetermined time slot, the node passes the token to the next node in the ring.

> [!consider] Analogy to a Real-World Scenario
>
> Imagine a group of people sitting in a circle, passing around an object like a ball or a baton. **Only the person holding the object is allowed to speak (transmit data). When they are done speaking, they pass the object** to the next person in the circle. This person then has the exclusive right to speak until they pass the object along. The process continues in this round-robin fashion, ensuring only one person speaks at a time without interruptions or collisions.

> [!example] Illustration of Token Passing MAC Protocol

> Consider a network with four nodes (A, B, C, D) organized in a logical ring. The token passing process may unfold as follows:
>
> 1. Initially, Node A holds the token, granting it the right to transmit data frames.
> 2. After Node A completes transmission or its time slot expires, it passes the token to Node B.
> 3. Node B now holds the token and can transmit its data frames.
> 4. The token continues to circulate from Node B to Node C, then to Node D, and back to Node A, in a predetermined logical ring.
> 5. The process repeats indefinitely, with each node transmitting when it holds the token.

> A diagram illustrating the token-passing process among the four nodes (A, B, C, D) in a logical ring would be helpful. The diagram should show the token being passed from one node to the next, granting the token-holding node the right to transmit data.
