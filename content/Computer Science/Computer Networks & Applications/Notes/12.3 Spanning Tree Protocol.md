> [!idea] Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs)
> Redundant alternate paths in switched networks offer several benefits:
> - Increased resilience: If one path fails, an alternate path can maintain connectivity.
> - Load balancing: Multiple paths can distribute traffic, improving network performance.
> 
> However, redundant paths can also lead to problems:
> - Broadcast storms: Endlessly forwarded broadcast frames can overwhelm the network.
> - MAC address table instability: Switches may constantly update their MAC tables due to frames arriving from different paths.
> 
> To address these issues, switches use the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):
> - STP organizes switches into a logical tree topology, with a root bridge at the top.
> - Redundant paths are identified and disabled by blocking specific interfaces.
> - STP ensures a single active path between any two switches, preventing loops.
> - If the active path fails, STP automatically enables a blocked path to maintain connectivity.
> 
> STP creates a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the network, which is a tree that connects all switches with the minimum total cost of links. Two popular algorithms for finding MSTs are:
> - Prim's algorithm: Starts with an arbitrary switch and greedily adds the nearest switch not yet in the tree until all switches are included.
> - Kruskal's algorithm: Sorts all links by cost and greedily adds the least-cost link that doesn't create a loop until all switches are connected.
> 
> By using MST algorithms, STP minimizes the cost of the spanning tree while ensuring a loop-free topology. This allows switches to maintain redundancy and efficient data transmission in the network.

> [!consider] STP: Traffic Lights for Network Loops
> Imagine a city with multiple roads connecting various intersections. To prevent accidents and ensure smooth traffic flow, traffic lights are installed at each intersection.
> 
> Similarly, in a switched network with redundant paths, STP acts like traffic lights to prevent loops and ensure efficient data flow:
> 
> - **Red Light**: When STP detects a potential loop, it "turns on the red light" by blocking specific interfaces. This prevents frames from being sent over these paths, just like a red light stops cars from entering an intersection.
> 
> - **Green Light**: STP "turns on the green light" for the root port and designated ports, allowing frames to be forwarded along the spanning tree. This is similar to how a green light allows cars to move through an intersection.
> 
> - **Amber Light**: When a network topology change occurs, STP enters a "listening" and "learning" state, similar to an amber light signaling a transition. During this time, switches update their MAC tables and prepare to forward frames along the new spanning tree.
> 
> Just as traffic lights coordinate traffic flow in a city, STP coordinates frame forwarding in a switched network, preventing loops and ensuring efficient data transmission.

> [!idea] Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) in Graph Theory
> - A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a spanning tree with the minimum total cost of edges among all possible spanning trees of a weighted graph.
> - Two popular algorithms for finding MSTs are:
>   - Prim's algorithm: Starts with an arbitrary vertex and greedily adds the nearest vertex not yet in the tree until all vertices are included.
>   - Kruskal's algorithm: Sorts all edges by cost and greedily adds the least-cost edge that doesn't create a loop until all vertices are connected.
> 
> While the concept of MSTs is related to spanning trees in the context of graph theory, it is **not directly applicable to the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** used in switched Ethernet networks, as STP's primary goal is to prevent loops rather than to minimize the total cost of links.
