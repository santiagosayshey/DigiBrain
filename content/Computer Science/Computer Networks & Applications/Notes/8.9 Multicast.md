>
> A multicast address is a special IP address used to **send a packet to multiple devices** (but not necessarily all devices) on a network simultaneously.
>
> Multicast addresses are commonly used for:
>
> 1. Broadcasting data: **Sending data to multiple recipients** who have expressed interest in receiving the data.
> 2. Streaming media: Delivering **audio or video content** to multiple clients simultaneously, such as in online video streaming or conference calls.
> 3. Network efficiency: **Reducing network traffic** by sending data only to devices that have subscribed to receive it.
>
> Multicast addresses allow efficient one-to-many communication, enabling applications to distribute data to multiple recipients without the need for individual connections to each recipient.

> [!example] Multicast Address
>
> Multicast addresses are typically assigned from specific ranges reserved for multicast communication.
>
> For example:
> - A common range for IPv4 multicast addresses is `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`.
> - A multicast address within this range might be `239.192.0.1`, representing a group of devices interested in receiving multicast data.
>
> Multicast addresses are used in various network protocols and applications, such as **Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)** for managing multicast group membership and streaming media protocols like Real-Time Protocol (RTP) for delivering multimedia content over networks.
