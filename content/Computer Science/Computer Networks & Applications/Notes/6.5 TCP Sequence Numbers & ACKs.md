> [!idea]+ Byte Streams
> In TCP, sequence numbers correspond to the position of the first byte in a packet's data within the overall byte stream. For instance, if a packet starts with sequence number 1 and carries 500 bytes of data, the acknowledgment number for the next packet would be 501.
> - This means that an ACK of 501 indicates the receiver has successfully received up to byte 500 and is ready to receive from the 501st byte onward.
