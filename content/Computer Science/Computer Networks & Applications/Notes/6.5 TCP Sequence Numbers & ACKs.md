> [!idea]+ Byte Streams
> In TCP, sequence numbers correspond to the position of the first byte in a packet's data within the overall byte stream. For instance, if a packet starts with sequence number 1 and carries 500 bytes of data, the acknowledgment number for the next packet would be 501.
> - This means that an ACK of 501 indicates the receiver has successfully received up to byte 500 and is ready to receive from the 501st byte onward.

> | `seq=42, ack=79, data="C"` | ~                          | User types and sends "C"                                | The sender sends data starting with the 42nd byte in the stream.<br><br>It ACKs 79 and says "I've received every byte up to 79 and am ready to receive the 79th byte."    |
> | ~                          | `seq=79, ack=43, data="C"` | Receiver receives "C" and echoes "C" back to the sender | The receiver sends data starting with the 79th byte in the stream.<br><br>It ACKs 43 and says "I've received every byte up to 43 and am ready to receive the 43rd byte." |

> [!idea]+ Cumulative ACKs
> In TCP, acknowledgments are cumulative, which means that each ACK number indicates that all bytes up to that number have been received successfully and in order. For instance, if the receiver sends an ACK of 150, it implies that it has received all data up to byte 149 and is ready to receive byte 150. This method helps to confirm the receipt of multiple packets with a single acknowledgment, simplifying the error handling process as the sender only needs to retransmit data starting from the byte not acknowledged.
