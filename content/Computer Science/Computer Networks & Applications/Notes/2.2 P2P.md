> Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a **decentralized** approach to digital communication, contrasting sharply with the traditional client-server model. In P2P networks, every participant, or "peer," acts both as a client and a server, making resources such as files, content, or bandwidth directly available to other network participants without requiring central coordination by servers.
