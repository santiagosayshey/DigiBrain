> Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a **decentralized** approach to digital communication, contrasting sharply with the traditional client-server model. In P2P networks, every participant, or "peer," acts both as a client and a server, making resources such as files, content, or bandwidth directly available to other network participants without requiring central coordination by servers.

$$
D_{cs} \geq \max \left( \frac{NF}{u_s}, \frac{F}{d_{min}} \right)
$$

- $D_{cs}$ - Distribution time for the client-server architecture.
- $N$ - Number of peers that want to obtain a copy of the file.
- $F$ - Size of the file to be distributed (in bits).
- $u_s$ - Upload rate of the server's access link.
- $d_{min}$ - Download rate of the peer with the lowest download rate.
