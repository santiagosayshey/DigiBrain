> 
> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a Transport Layer protocol that provides the appearance of a reliable channel over the potentially unreliable internet layer (IP). 
> 
> - **Reliability Over IP**: TCP is designed to create a reliable data transport environment despite the inherent unreliability of network layers, ensuring data integrity and delivery assurance.
> 
> - **Flow and Congestion Control**: By implementing flow control and congestion control mechanisms, TCP manages the rate of data transmission to match the speed at which the receiver can process the data and the network can handle the traffic.
> 
> - **Connection Orientation**: TCP is not a virtual circuit; it does not retain the state of the connection in the network elements (routers). Instead, all connection-related information is maintained by the endpoints in the communication.
> 
> - **Handling Transmission Challenges**: TCP has strategies to address common issues like lost packets, packets that arrive out of order, and packets that are delayed.
> 
> - **Hybrid Operation Mode**: The protocol uses a combination of go-back-N and selective repeat strategies for error handling. This allows TCP to acknowledge received segments correctly and to efficiently manage the retransmission of lost or erroneous segments.

> [!idea] TCP Mechanisms for Handling Issues
>
> TCP's role in ensuring [[5.1 Reliable Data Transfer|Reliable Data Transfer]] includes methods for dealing with issues such as packet loss, corruption, reordering, and delays.
>
> - **Lost Packets**: TCP detects lost packets using timeouts. If an acknowledgment is not received for a data segment within a certain time frame, TCP assumes the segment was lost and retransmits it.
>
> - **Corrupted Packets**: TCP employs a checksum to verify the integrity of data in each packet. If a checksum mismatch occurs, indicating corrupted data, TCP discards the packet and relies on retransmission for recovery.
>
> - **Re-ordered Packets**: Sequence numbers also enable TCP to properly reorder packets. If packets arrive out of order, the sequence numbers are used to sort them into the correct order.
>
> - **Delayed Packets**: TCP's acknowledgment system, which includes sending cumulative acknowledgments with sequence numbers for packets, allows it to deal with delays. If packets arrive late, the cumulative acknowledgments can still ensure that the sender is aware of what has been received.

>
> - **Source Port Number**: Identifies the sending port and helps in multiplexing and demultiplexing the data stream.
> - **Destination Port Number**: Specifies the receiving port and is used alongside the source port to direct data to the correct application.
> - **Sequence Number**: In TCP, every byte of data is sequenced so that even if the segments arrive out of order, they can be reassembled in the correct order at the destination. The sequence number in the TCP header of a segment signifies the ordinal number of the first data byte within that segment relative to the stream of all bytes sent over the connection. This is like numbering the pages of a book so that even if the pages get mixed up, you can still arrange them in the proper order.
> - **Acknowledgment Number**: This number is crucial for the reliability of the TCP protocol. It lets the sender know which bytes the receiver has already gotten. Specifically, it contains the sequence number of the next expected byte. When the sender receives this acknowledgment, it understands that all bytes up to that number have been successfully received. This system allows TCP to not only confirm receipt of data but also to identify which segment needs to be resent in case something goes wrong in transmission.
> - **Header Length**: Indicates the size of the TCP header so that the start of the payload data can be found.
> - **Flags**: A set of bits used to control the flow of data and establish connections. Common flags include URG (Urgent Pointer field is significant), ACK (Acknowledgment field is significant), PSH (Push Function), RST (Reset the connection), SYN (Synchronize sequence numbers), and FIN (No more data from sender).
> - **Receive Window Size**: Used for flow control; it specifies the size of the buffer and how much data the sender is allowed to transmit before waiting for an acknowledgment.
> - **Checksum**: Validates the integrity of the header and data sections to ensure error-free communication.
> - **Urgent Pointer**: Points to the sequence number of the byte following urgent data, allowing certain data to be prioritized.
> - **Options**: Allows for additional features like maximum segment size specification, timestamps, and other functionalities that are not covered by the standard header.
> - **Application Data**: This is the payload that carries the actual data being transmitted over the TCP connection.

> [!consider] Consider TCP's Overhead
> Notice that the header segment size of a TCP Packet is double the size of a UDP packet. This adds up when hundreds or even thousands of packets are sent over and over. We can now start to see why TCP is considered better when reliability is needed, but UDP is better for speed.



> [!consider]+ TCP Timeouts
>
> The design of TCP timeouts centers around the balance between network efficiency and reliability. By timing out infrequently, TCP aims to avoid premature retransmissions which could be unnecessary if packets are simply delayed rather than lost. The Round Trip Time (RTT) helps TCP adapt to the dynamic nature of network congestion and latency, ensuring that the timeout reflects current conditions rather than fixed assumptions. In essence, TCP's timeout mechanism is designed to be as patient as possible, waiting just enough to reasonably infer that a segment might be lost without waiting so long that it hampers communication flow. 
>
> **The mathematical formulas used are as follows:**
>
> $$ \text{EstimatedRTT} = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{EstimatedRTT} + \alpha \times \text{SampleRTT} $$
>
> Here, $\alpha$ typically has a value of 0.125. This parameter determines the degree to which the new sample affects the moving average.
>
> To account for variability and avoid premature timeouts, TCP also calculates a Deviation:
>
> $$ \text{Deviation} = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Deviation} + \alpha \times |\text{SampleRTT} - \text{EstimatedRTT}| $$
>
> The timeout is then set as:
>
> $$ \text{Timeout} = \text{EstimatedRTT} + 4 \times \text{Deviation} $$
>
> This formula ensures that the timeout is not too short, which would cause unnecessary retransmissions, and not too long, which would delay the recovery from lost segments. The multiplier (in this case, 4) is chosen to provide a buffer that accounts for the variability in the network delay.
