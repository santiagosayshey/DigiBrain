> [!idea] TCP Overview
> 
> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a Transport Layer protocol that provides the appearance of a reliable channel over the potentially unreliable internet layer (IP). 
> 
> - **Reliability Over IP**: TCP is designed to create a reliable data transport environment despite the inherent unreliability of network layers, ensuring data integrity and delivery assurance.
> 
> - **Flow and Congestion Control**: By implementing flow control and congestion control mechanisms, TCP manages the rate of data transmission to match the speed at which the receiver can process the data and the network can handle the traffic.
> 
> - **Connection Orientation**: TCP is not a virtual circuit; it does not retain the state of the connection in the network elements (routers). Instead, all connection-related information is maintained by the endpoints in the communication.
> 
> - **Handling Transmission Challenges**: TCP has strategies to address common issues like lost packets, packets that arrive out of order, and packets that are delayed.
> 
> - **Hybrid Operation Mode**: The protocol uses a combination of go-back-N and selective repeat strategies for error handling. This allows TCP to acknowledge received segments correctly and to efficiently manage the retransmission of lost or erroneous segments.


> [!idea] TCP Mechanisms for Handling Issues
>
> TCP's role in ensuring [[5.1 Reliable Data Transfer|Reliable Data Transfer]] includes methods for dealing with issues such as packet loss, corruption, reordering, and delays.
>
> - **Lost Packets**: TCP detects lost packets using timeouts. If an acknowledgment is not received for a data segment within a certain time frame, TCP assumes the segment was lost and retransmits it.
>
> - **Corrupted Packets**: TCP employs a checksum to verify the integrity of data in each packet. If a checksum mismatch occurs, indicating corrupted data, TCP discards the packet and relies on retransmission for recovery.
>
> - **Re-ordered Packets**: Sequence numbers also enable TCP to properly reorder packets. If packets arrive out of order, the sequence numbers are used to sort them into the correct order.
>
> - **Delayed Packets**: TCP's acknowledgment system, which includes sending cumulative acknowledgments with sequence numbers for packets, allows it to deal with delays. If packets arrive late, the cumulative acknowledgments can still ensure that the sender is aware of what has been received.
