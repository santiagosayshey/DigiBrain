> [!idea] TCP Overview
> 
> Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is an essential protocol within the TCP/IP suite that provides the appearance of a reliable channel over the potentially unreliable internet layer (IP). Here's a breakdown of the points from the image:
> 
> - **Reliability Over IP**: TCP is designed to create a reliable data transport environment despite the inherent unreliability of network layers, ensuring data integrity and delivery assurance.
> 
> - **Flow and Congestion Control**: By implementing flow control and congestion control mechanisms, TCP manages the rate of data transmission to match the speed at which the receiver can process the data and the network can handle the traffic.
> 
> - **Connection Orientation**: TCP is not a virtual circuit; it does not retain the state of the connection in the network elements (routers). Instead, all connection-related information is maintained by the endpoints in the communication.
> 
> - **Handling Transmission Challenges**: TCP has strategies to address common issues like lost packets, packets that arrive out of order, and packets that are delayed.
> 
> - **Hybrid Operation Mode**: The protocol uses a combination of go-back-N and selective repeat strategies for error handling. This allows TCP to acknowledge received segments correctly and to efficiently manage the retransmission of lost or erroneous segments.
> 
> This high-level overview captures the robust capabilities of TCP, highlighting its role in enabling a reliable end-to-end communication service over networks where packet loss, variable delays, and reordering can occur.
