> [!idea]+ User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
>
> UDP is a simple, connectionless transport layer protocol that provides unreliable datagram delivery service. Its key characteristics include:
>
> - No connection establishment (which can add delay)
> - Simple: no connection state at sender, receiver
> - Small segment header
> - No congestion control; UDP can blast away as fast as desired
> - Can add reliability at application layer
> - 1's complement checksum can be used to detect (but not correct) errors (example)
> - Segments can be lost or delivered to application out of order
> - Each segment is independent of others
>
> ![UDP segment format](image.png)
>
> The UDP segment format consists of a 32-bit segment, including:
>
> - Source port # (optional)
> - Destination port # (required)
> - Length, in bytes of UDP segment, including header
> - Application data (message)
