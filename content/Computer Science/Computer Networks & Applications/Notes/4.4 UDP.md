> [!idea]+ User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
>  
> UDP is a simple, connectionless transport layer protocol that provides unreliable datagram delivery service. Its key characteristics include:
>
> - No connection establishment (which can add delay) 
> - Simple: no connection state at sender, receiver
> - Small segment header
> - No congestion control; UDP can blast away as fast as desired
> - Can add reliability at application layer
> - 1's complement checksum can be used to detect (but not correct) errors (example)
> - Segments can be lost or delivered to application out of order
> - Each segment is independent of others

> Length, in bytes of UDP segment, including header:
> - The length field specifies the total size of the UDP segment, including both the header and the application data (message).
> - This field is necessary because the size of the application data can vary, and the receiver needs to know how much data to expect in order to allocate the appropriate buffer space and process the segment correctly.
>
> Source port # | dest port #: 
> - The source and destination port numbers are used to identify the sending and receiving application processes.
> - These 16-bit fields allow multiple application processes on the same host to use UDP simultaneously.
>
>Checksum
> - The checksum field is used for error detection. It is calculated over the UDP header, the application data, and a pseudo-header that includes information from the IP header (source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and UDP length).
> - The checksum is optional in IPv4 but mandatory in IPv6.
>
> Application data (message):
> - This field contains the actual data being transmitted by the application.
> - The size of this field is variable, and the length is determined by the length field in the UDP header.

> [!consider] Consider Header Overhead
>
> Adding headers to a protocol provides additional functionality but also increases overhead:
> - Each header field serves a specific purpose, such as identifying the source and destination, specifying the length of the data, or providing error detection.
> - However, the more header fields added, the larger the overhead in terms of processing time and the amount of data transmitted over the network.
> - This overhead can impact the efficiency of the protocol, especially for small payloads.
> - Therefore, protocol designers must strike a balance between functionality and overhead when defining the header format.
