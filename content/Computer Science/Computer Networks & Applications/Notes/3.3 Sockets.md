>Sockets serve as an API between a process and the transport layer, enabling applications to send and receive data over a network. They abstract the complexities of network protocols, allowing developers to easily implement network communication within their applications. Through sockets, processes can communicate using standard transport protocols like TCP for reliable, ordered data transmission or UDP for faster, connectionless communication. This API simplifies network programming by providing a set of functions for data exchange, connection management, and more, making it a fundamental tool in the development of networked applications.
