> [!consider] Consider
> When choosing between TCP and UDP, a network application designer must consider criteria about what is most important for their application. Clearly, we want to use **TCP for Web Proxies.**

| **Criteria**                        | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**                                                         | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**                                                                   | **Examples**                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Reliability                     | High - ensures data is delivered exactly as sent and in order                               | Low - does not guarantee delivery, order, or data integrity                                    | TCP: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP)        |
| Overhead                        | Higher - due to acknowledgments, retransmission, and sequence tracking                      | Lower - no connection establishment or maintenance overhead                                    | UDP: Streaming media (live video or audio)          |
| Throughput                      | Lower - overhead and flow control can reduce speed                                          | Potentially higher - less overhead means data can be sent faster                               | UDP: Voice over IP (VoIP), Online multiplayer games |
| Bounded Delays                  | Can be variable due to retransmissions and congestion control                               | Typically lower and more predictable, but no guarantees                                        | UDP: Domain Name System (DNS) lookups               |
| Security                        | Same as UDP (data transmitted can be intercepted) but can be layered with TLS/SSL for HTTPS | Same as TCP (security must be implemented at application layer or with DTLS for encrypted UDP) | TCP: Secure file transfer (SFTP)                    |
| Timing and Bandwidth Guarantees | No inherent support for timing or bandwidth guarantees                                      | No inherent support, but better suited for real-time applications                              | UDP: Internet telephony, video conferencing         |
| Usage Scenario                  | Applications that require reliable, ordered delivery of information                         | Applications where speed is critical and lossy data transfer is acceptable                     |                                                     |
> [!idea]+ TCP vs UDP Comparison
>
> | Feature | TCP | UDP | Description |
> |---------|-----|-----|-------------|
> | **Reliability** | Yes | No | TCP is reliable as it ensures that all data packets are delivered in the order they were sent. UDP does not guarantee delivery or order, making it less reliable. |
> | **Connection Type** | Connection-oriented | Connectionless | TCP establishes a connection before transmitting data, ensuring a dedicated path for communication. UDP sends data without establishing a connection, making it faster but less reliable. |
> | **Speed** | Slower | Faster | TCP's reliability and connection-oriented nature make it slower. UDP's lack of connection establishment and reliability checks makes it faster. |
> | **Data Flow Control** | Yes | No | TCP controls data flow to ensure that the receiver can handle the data rate, preventing data loss. UDP does not have this feature, which can lead to data loss in high-speed transmissions. |
> | **Error Checking** | Yes | Yes | Both TCP and UDP perform error checking. However, TCP also corrects errors by retransmitting lost packets, while UDP simply discards errored packets. |
> | **Usage** | Web browsing, email, file transfers | Streaming media, online gaming, voice over IP (VoIP) | TCP is used for applications that require reliability and order. UDP is used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability. |


> [!idea] **Understanding Server Sockets in TCP Communication**
>
> When a client initiates a connection to a server (such as visiting "www.foo.com" on port 80), the server's main listening socket accepts the incoming request. This socket is bound to a specific port number and is dedicated to listening for incoming connections. Upon accepting a connection, the server creates a new server socket specifically for communicating with that client. This allows the server to maintain the initial listening socket on port 80 open and ready to accept other incoming requests, thus enabling the server to handle multiple clients concurrently. This is called a **non blocking** server socket. Each new server socket typically communicates over the same port but is distinguished by a unique combination of client IP address and client port number, maintaining separate connections for each client as a distinct process.



| **Server Steps** | **Protocol** | **Client Steps** |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1. Create socket using `socket()` for incoming requests. | | 1. Create socket using `socket()`. |
| 2. Bind the listening socket to the server's host ID and port X using `bind()`. | | |
| 3. Wait for incoming connection requests using `listen()`. | | |
| 4. Accept incoming connections using `accept()` to create a connection socket. | $\leftarrow \text{TCP Connection} \rightarrow$ | 2. Connect to server host ID, port=X using `connect()`. |
| 5. Read request from `connection_socket`. | $\leftarrow \text{Get Request}$ | 3. Send request using `client_socket`. |
| 6. Convert characters to uppercase (or process request). | | |
| 7. Write reply to `connection_socket`. | $\text{200 Response} \rightarrow$ | 4. Read reply from `client_socket`. |
| 8. Close `connection_socket`. | | 5. Close `client_socket`. |

A full implementation of a non blocking web server in `C` can be found in [[Assignment 1 - Non Blocking Web Server]]

> - No handshaking
> - Sender explicitly attaches IP address and port of destination
> - Server must extract IP address, port of sender from received datagram
