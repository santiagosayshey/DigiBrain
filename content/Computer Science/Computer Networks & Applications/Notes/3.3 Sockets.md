Sockets serve as endpoints for two-way network communication between applications, operating at the transport layer of the OSI model. They provide a standardized interface for applications to send and receive data using transport layer protocols like TCP (for reliable, ordered communication) and UDP (for faster, connectionless communication). By abstracting the complexities of these protocols, sockets enable applications to easily exchange data over a network, using IP addresses and port numbers for precise targeting. Whether for web pages via HTTP or file transfers via FTP, sockets are the essential "postmen" of the digital world, ensuring data is delivered accurately and efficiently between devices.
