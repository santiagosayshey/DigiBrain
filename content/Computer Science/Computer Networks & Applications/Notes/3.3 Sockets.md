> Sockets provide the Application Programmers' Interface (API) between a process and the transport layer (as in `sys/socket.h` for C or `java.net` for Java). They enable user application code to send and receive data over the network. Application programmers use sockets to:
>
> - Specify the transport protocol (TCP for reliable, ordered delivery or UDP for quick, connectionless communication).
> - Define the host to send messages to, via an IP address or hostname.
> - Determine the exact process on the destination host to communicate with, using a port number.
>
> This API facilitates network communication by abstracting the complex details of the underlying transport and network protocols.
