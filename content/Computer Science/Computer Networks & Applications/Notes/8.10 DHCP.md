> [!consider] Assigning IPs to Hosts
>
> When a **device connects** to a network, it requires a **unique IP address** to communicate. This assignment is done through:
>
> - **Static IP Assignment**: Admins manually hardcode addresses in a file. 
>
> - **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Servers automatically assign addresses upon connection.
>
> - **Link-local Addressing (IPv6)**: In IPv6, hosts generate addresses without DHCP, using MAC addresses or randomization for communication within a network segment.
>
> These methods provide unique identifiers for seamless communication within and across networks.

> [!idea] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
>
> DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices that connect to a network. Here's how DHCP works:
>
> 1. **Request**: When a device, such as a computer or smartphone, joins a network, it sends a DHCP request broadcast message to discover DHCP servers available on the network.
>
> 2. **Offer**: DHCP servers on the network respond with DHCP offer messages containing IP address lease information, such as the IP address being offered, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses, and lease duration.
>
> 3. **Selection**: The device selects one of the DHCP offers and sends a DHCP request message to the chosen DHCP server, confirming its request for the offered IP address and network configuration settings.
>
> 4. **Acknowledgment**: Upon receiving the DHCP request message, the DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message, finalizing the IP address lease and providing the device with the requested network configuration settings.

Got it! Here's a more detailed example showing what happens on each side during each step of the DHCP transaction:

> Below is a detailed example of a DHCP transaction between a client and a DHCP server:

> | Step | Client (192.168.1.100)                                             | DHCP Server (192.168.1.1)                                       |
> |------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | 1.   | **Request**: The client sends a DHCP discover message, broadcasting its request for available DHCP servers.                                                                                                  |       |
> |      | **Client Message**: DHCP Discover<br>Source IP: 0.0.0.0<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Client MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF  |       |
> |      |                                                                        | **Server Action**: Receives DHCP discover message from client.<br>Stores client MAC address.                                        |
> | 2.   |       | **Offer**: The DHCP server responds with a DHCP offer message, offering an available IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) and network configuration settings.                                         |
> |      |       | **Client Action**: Receives DHCP offer message from server.<br>Stores offered IP address and other configuration settings.           |
> | 3.   | **Selection**: The client selects the offered IP address and sends a DHCP request message to the DHCP server, confirming its request. |       |
> |      | **Client Message**: DHCP Request<br>Source IP: 0.0.0.0<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Client MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF<br>Requested IP: 192.168.1.10 |       |
> |      |                                                                        | **Server Action**: Receives DHCP request message from client.<br>Checks lease availability for requested IP address.<br>Stores lease information for client. |
> | 4.   |       | **Acknowledgment**: Upon receiving the DHCP request message, the DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message to the client, finalizing the IP address lease and providing the requested configuration settings. |
> |      |       | **Client Action**: Receives DHCP acknowledgment message from server.<br>Confirms IP address lease and stores provided configuration settings.  |
>
> In this example, the client initiates the DHCP transaction by broadcasting a discover message, and the DHCP server responds with an offer. The client then selects the offered IP address and sends a request, which the server acknowledges, finalizing the IP address lease and providing the necessary configuration settings.
