> [!consider] Assigning IPs to Hosts
>
> When a **device connects** to a network, it requires a **unique IP address** to communicate. This assignment is done through:
>
> - **Static IP Assignment**: Admins manually hardcode addresses in a file. 
>
> - **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Servers automatically assign addresses upon connection.
>
> - **Link-local Addressing (IPv6)**: In IPv6, hosts generate addresses without DHCP, using MAC addresses or randomization for communication within a network segment.
>
> These methods provide unique identifiers for seamless communication within and across networks.

> [!idea] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
>
> DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices that connect to a network. Here's how DHCP works:
>
> 1. **Request**: When a device, such as a computer or smartphone, joins a network, it sends a DHCP request broadcast message to discover DHCP servers available on the network.
>
> 2. **Offer**: DHCP servers on the network respond with DHCP offer messages containing IP address lease information, such as the IP address being offered, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses, and lease duration.
>
> 3. **Selection**: The device selects one of the DHCP offers and sends a DHCP request message to the chosen DHCP server, confirming its request for the offered IP address and network configuration settings.
>
> 4. **Acknowledgment**: Upon receiving the DHCP request message, the DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message, finalizing the IP address lease and providing the device with the requested network configuration settings.

> |------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
> | 1.   | **DHCP Discover**<br>Source IP: 0.0.0.0<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Client MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF |       |

> | 3.   | **DHCP Request**<br>Source IP: 0.0.0.0<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Client MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF<br>Requested IP: 192.168.1.10 |       |
> | 4.   |       | **DHCP Acknowledgment**<br>Source IP: 192.168.1.1<br>Destination IP: 192.168.1.100<br>Leased IP: 192.168.1.10<br>Lease Time: 86400 seconds |

> In this example:
>
> - The client sends a DHCP discover message to discover available DHCP servers on the network.
> - The DHCP server responds with a DHCP offer message, offering an available IP address (192.168.1.10) and lease duration (86400 seconds).
> - The client selects the offered IP address and sends a DHCP request message to confirm its request.
> - Upon receiving the DHCP request message, the DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message, finalizing the IP address lease for the client.
