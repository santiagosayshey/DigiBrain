> TCP Connections are established using a **3-way handshake**.
> - **Request** connection: Sender sends a **SYN** packet. This contains a randomly selected sequence number `x`. 
> - **Grant** connection: Receiver responds with a **SYN/ACK** packet. This contains another randomly selected sequence number `y` as well as an ACK of `x+1` 
> - **Acknowledge** connection: Sender responds with an **ACK** packet. This contains sequence number `x+1` and ACK `y+1`. This ACK packet also contains the data of the HTTP request.
