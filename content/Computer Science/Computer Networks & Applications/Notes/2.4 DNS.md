> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the backbone of the internet's naming system, enabling a user-friendly way of locating websites and services through domain names rather than numerical IP addresses. It's a decentralized database that allows seamless changes and updates within an organization without the need for a central authority. By translating domain names to IP addresses, DNS servers facilitate the connection between users and the websites they wish to visit, operating on UDP/TCP port 53.
