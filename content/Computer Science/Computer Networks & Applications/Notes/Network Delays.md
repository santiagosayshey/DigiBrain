> We need to be able to measure the performance of our ability to communicate. We do this by understanding the different delays that occur in network communication.

| <center>Propagation Delay</center>  | The time it takes for a signal to travel from point A to point B over a network medium. It is influenced by the type of medium, the distance between the points, and typically the speed of the signal, which is often close to $c$, the speed of light $(3 \times 10^8$ m/s) in vacuum. | $$t_p=\frac{Distance}{Speed}$$ |
| <center>Transmission Delay</center> | The time required to transmit all the bits of a packet into the network medium. Packet size is denoted by $L$, and the bandwidth (data carrying capacity) is denoted by $R$                                                                                                              | $$t_T=\frac{L}{R}$$            |
