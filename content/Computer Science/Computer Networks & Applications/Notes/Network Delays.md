> We need to be able to measure the performance of our ability to communicate. We do this by understanding the different delays that occur in network communication.

| Delay Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Formula                                 |

| <center>Propagation Delay</center>  | The time it takes for a signal to travel from point A to point B over a network medium. It is influenced by the type of medium, the distance between the points, and typically the speed of the signal, which is often close to $c$, the speed of light $(3 \times 10^8$ m/s) in vacuum. | $$t_p=\frac{Distance}{Speed}$$          |
| <center>Transmission Delay</center> | The time required to transmit all the bits of a packet into the network medium. Packet size is denoted by $L$, and the bandwidth (data carrying capacity) is denoted by $R$.                                                                                                             | $$t_T=\frac{L}{R}$$                     |
| <center>Queuing Delay</center>      | The time a packet spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted over the network due to congestion or prior packet processing. The delay varies depending on the queue's length and the network's current traffic load.                                                          | Variable; depends on queue length and network traffic |
| <center>Processing Delay</center>   | The time taken by a network device (e.g., router, switch) to process a packet. This includes examining the packet's header, making routing decisions, and performing error checking.                                                                                                     | Variable; depends on device and packet complexity     |
