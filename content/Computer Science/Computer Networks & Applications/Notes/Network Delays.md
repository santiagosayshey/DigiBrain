> We need to be able to measure the performance of our ability to communicate. We do this by understanding the different delays that occur in network communication.

| Propagation Delay  | The time it takes for a signal to travel from point A to point B over a network medium. It is influenced by the type of medium, the distance between the points, and typically the speed of the signal, which is often close to $c$, the speed of light $(3 \times 10^8$ m/s) in vacuum. | $$\frac{Distance}{Speed}$$ |
| Transmission Delay | Tran                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                            |
