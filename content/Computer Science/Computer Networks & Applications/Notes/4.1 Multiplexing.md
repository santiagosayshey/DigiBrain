> [!idea]+ Transport Layer Overview
>
> The Transport Layer is **responsible for providing logical communication between processes**. It uses the services of the network layer to try and transfer data between processes, and is limited by the services offered by this layer. There are two main protocols that the transport layer provides - TCP and UDP. For a comparison of the two, see: [[3.3 Sockets]]
>
> The fundamental service of TCP and UDP is to take the Network Layer's delivery service, which connects hosts, and extend it to **a delivery service between processes**. They achieve this through the process of multiplexing and de-multiplexing the data sent by processes.

> [!consider]+ Consider Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
>
> **Multiplexing** refers to the process of combining data from multiple application processes, all destined for transmission across the network, into a single transport-layer protocol defined by their headers. These headers contain the source port (port of the socket sending the data) and the destination port (port of the socket that is receiving the data). The source port is needed to send replies back.
>
> On the other end, **Demultiplexing** is the reverse process. It involves taking data received from the network layer and distributing it to the appropriate application processes based on header information, such as port numbers. This ensures that data intended for different applications or services is correctly routed, allowing multiple applications to share a single network connection without data mix-up.
