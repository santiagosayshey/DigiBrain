> For example, if an IP address belongs to Class A, the first 8 bits (the first octet) represent the network part, while the remaining 24 bits (the last three octets) represent the host part.

> The University of Adelaide could be assigned a Class B IP address, such as 129.127.0.0, allowing for a large number of hosts within the university network. In this case, the first two octets (129.127) represent the network part, and the last two octets (0.0) represent the host part.


> [!example] Network over Time
> Over time, as the internet grew, the most desirable Class B addresses were used up. This led to a practice of assigning multiple Class C addresses to a single network to accommodate more hosts. However, this approach has several drawbacks:
>
> 1. Inefficient use of IP address space: Assigning multiple Class C addresses to a network results in many unused IP addresses, as each Class C network can only accommodate 254 hosts.
>
> 2. Increased routing table size: Each Class C network assigned to a single organization requires a separate entry in the routing tables of internet routers, leading to larger and less efficient routing tables.
>
> 3. Administrative overhead: Managing multiple Class C networks for a single organization can be more complex and time-consuming than managing a single, appropriately sized network.


> [!idea] CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
>
> CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses that **addresses the limitations of classful** addressing. CIDR allows us to **define where the network part ends and the host part starts**, rather than being constrained by the fixed boundaries of classful addressing.
>
> In CIDR notation, an IP address is written as **a.b.c.d/x**, where **x is the number of bits in the network portion** of the address. This allows for more flexible and efficient allocation of IP addresses, as the **network portion can be of any length**, not just 8, 16, or 24 bits as in classful addressing.

> In this example, the "/23" indicates that the first 23 bits of the IP address represent the network portion, while the remaining 9 bits represent the host portion. This allows for more granular allocation of IP addresses compared to classful addressing.

By focusing on the key difference between CIDR and classful addressing, which is the ability to define the boundary between the network and host parts of an IP address, the explanation becomes more intuitive and easier to understand.
