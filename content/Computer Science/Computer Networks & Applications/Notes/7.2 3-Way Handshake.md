Sure, here's how you can add a "consider" callout that includes the rock climbing analogy for clarity:

> [!idea]+ Idea
> TCP Connections are established using a **3-way handshake**.
> - **Request** connection: Sender sends a **SYN** packet. This contains a randomly selected sequence number `x`. 
> - **Grant** connection: Receiver responds with a **SYN/ACK** packet. This contains another randomly selected sequence number `y` as well as an ACK of `x+1` 
> - **Acknowledge** connection: Sender responds with an **ACK** packet. This contains sequence number `x+1` and ACK `y+1`. This ACK packet also contains the data of the HTTP request.
> - <font color="#92d050">Note</font>: The `S` bit in the TCP headers are set to `1` for **SYN** packets

> [!consider]+ Why do we need three messages instead of two?
> **Consider rock climbing**: Person 1 at the top throws a rope down (SYN). Person at the bottom grabs the rope and wiggles it to signal they are ready and can securely hold the rope (SYN/ACK). Then, the person at the top wiggles the rope again to confirm that they are now ready for the climber to start ascending (ACK). This ensures both parties are prepared and secure before the climb (data transfer) begins.
