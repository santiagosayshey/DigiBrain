> **Consider rock climbing**: Person 1 at the top throws a rope down (SYN). Person at the bottom grabs the rope and wiggles it to signal they are ready and can securely hold the rope (SYN/ACK). Then, the person at the top wiggles the rope again to confirm that they are now ready for the climber to start ascending (ACK). This ensures both parties are prepared and secure before the climb (data transfer) begins.

> This three-step process **prevents half-open connections**. For example, if a client sends a SYN but the SYN/ACK response is delayed and times out, the client might resend the SYN, initiating another connection attempt. Without the final ACK, the server might prepare for a connection that the client no longer considers active, leading to a state where one side thinks the connection is open (half-open connection), while it's actually not fully established. This can lead to a proliferation of half-open connections which put significant load on the network, leading to potential system downtime, wasted resources, and decreased performance.
