> [!motivation] The Crowded Room Analogy
> Imagine **trying to communicate in a crowded room where everyone is shouting over each other.** It's chaotic, and messages are likely to get lost or misinterpreted. This scenario illustrates the challenge of communicating over a shared medium, where multiple devices or nodes are trying to transmit data simultaneously.

> [!consider] Direct Links vs. Shared Mediums
> One solution to the shared medium problem is to establish **direct, dedicated links between nodes**. This eliminates interference and ensures secure communication. However, this approach is **expensive and doesn't scale** well as the number of devices increases.
> 
> An alternative is to use **shared broadcast links**, where all devices communicate over the same medium. This is more **cost-effective and scalable** but introduces the need for coordination to avoid **collisions** and ensure successful data transmission.

> [!idea] MAC Protocol  
>
> The goal of MAC protocols is to achieve:
>
> - **Efficiency**: Maximize the utilization of the available bandwidth.
>   
> - **Fairness**: Ensure that all nodes have equal opportunities to access the channel.
>
> - **Simplicity**: Minimize the complexity of the protocol implementation. 
>
> - **Decentralization**: Enable distributed operation without relying on a central coordinator.
>
> MAC protocols can be broadly classified into three categories:
>
> 1. **Channel Partitioning**: Divides the available bandwidth into smaller channels, each allocated to a single node. Examples include TDMA and FDMA. Best suited for high load scenarios where fairness and avoiding collisions is crucial.
>
> 2. **Random Access**: Allows nodes to access the channel randomly when they have data to send. Examples include ALOHA and CSMA. Collisions need to be recovered from. Good for low to moderate loads with unpredictable traffic patterns.  
>
> 3. **Taking Turns**: Allocates the channel to nodes in a round-robin fashion, allowing each node to transmit for a specific duration. Examples include polling and token-passing protocols. Suitable for moderate and predictable load scenarios with a fixed number of nodes.


> [!idea] MAC Addresses
>
> A MAC address u**niquely identifies a device on a local area network (LAN).** It is used for communication at the data link layer to ensure accurate data frame delivery on the shared LAN medium.
>
> MAC addresses are represented as:
> - Six groups of two hexadecimal digits
> - Separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E or 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E)
> - First three groups identify the manufacturer or vendor (Organizationally Unique Identifier)
> - Last three groups represent a unique identifier assigned by the manufacturer
>
> MAC addresses are globally unique for proper communication and data frame delivery on LANs.
