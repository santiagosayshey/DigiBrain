> [!motivation] The Crowded Room Analogy
> Imagine **trying to communicate in a crowded room where everyone is shouting over each other.** It's chaotic, and messages are likely to get lost or misinterpreted. This scenario illustrates the challenge of communicating over a shared medium, where multiple devices or nodes are trying to transmit data simultaneously.

> [!consider] Direct Links vs. Shared Mediums
> One solution to the shared medium problem is to establish **direct, dedicated links between nodes**. This eliminates interference and ensures secure communication. However, this approach is **expensive and doesn't scale** well as the number of devices increases.
> 
> An alternative is to use **shared broadcast links**, where all devices communicate over the same medium. This is more **cost-effective and scalable** but introduces the need for coordination to avoid **collisions** and ensure successful data transmission.

> [!idea] MAC Protocol
> The goal of MAC protocols is to achieve:
> - **Efficiency**: Maximize the utilization of the available bandwidth.
> - **Fairness**: Ensure that all nodes have equal opportunities to access the channel.
> - **Simplicity**: Minimize the complexity of the protocol implementation.
> - **Decentralization**: Enable distributed operation without relying on a central coordinator.
> 
> MAC protocols can be broadly classified into three categories:
> 
> 1. **Channel Partitioning**: Divides the available bandwidth into smaller channels, each allocated to a single node. Examples include TDMA and FDMA.
> 
> 2. **Random Access**: Allows nodes to access the channel randomly when they have data to send. Examples include ALOHA and CSMA. Collisions need to be recovered from. 
> 
> 3. **Taking Turns**: Allocates the channel to nodes in a round-robin fashion, allowing each node to transmit for a specific duration. Examples include polling and token-passing protocols.









> [!example] ALOHA Collision Detection and Recovery
>
> ALOHA is a simple random access protocol where nodes can transmit data over a shared channel whenever they have data to send, with the possibility for collisions. 
>
> To illustrate how ALOHA handles collisions, consider the following scenario with three nodes: Node A, Node B, and Node C.
>
> 1. **Node A starts transmitting data**
>    - Node A begins sending a data packet over the shared channel.
>    - While transmitting, Node A continuously monitors the channel to detect any collisions.
>
> 2. **Node B also starts transmitting, causing a collision**
>    - Shortly after Node A starts transmitting, Node B also attempts to send a data packet over the same channel.
>    - The signals from Node A and Node B overlap, resulting in a collision on the shared channel.
>
> 3. **Nodes A and B detect the collision**
>    - Both Node A and Node B detect the collision by comparing the signal they are transmitting with the signal they are receiving from the channel.
>    - Since the received signal differs from the transmitted signal, they realize a collision has occurred.
>
> 4. **Nodes A and B generate jam signals**
>    - Upon detecting the collision, both Node A and Node B generate and transmit a jam signal over the channel.
>    - The jam signal is a predefined signal that notifies all nodes that a collision has occurred.
>
> 5. **Node C detects the jam signal**
>    - Node C, which was not initially transmitting, detects the jam signal on the channel.
>    - This indicates to Node C that a collision has occurred, and it should refrain from transmitting until the channel is clear.
>
> 6. **Nodes A and B initiate the backoff procedure**
>    - After transmitting the jam signal, Node A and Node B each wait for a random amount of time (backoff period) before attempting to retransmit their data packets.
>    - The random backoff period helps reduce the probability of another collision during the next transmission attempt.
>
> 7. **Nodes A and B retransmit their data packets**
>    - After the backoff period, Node A and Node B retransmit their respective data packets one at a time, assuming no other node has started transmitting in the meantime.
>    - If another collision occurs, the process repeats from step 3.
