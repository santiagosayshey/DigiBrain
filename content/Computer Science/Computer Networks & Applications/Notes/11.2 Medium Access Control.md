> [!motivation] The Crowded Room Analogy
> Imagine **trying to communicate in a crowded room where everyone is shouting over each other.** It's chaotic, and messages are likely to get lost or misinterpreted. This scenario illustrates the challenge of communicating over a shared medium, where multiple devices or nodes are trying to transmit data simultaneously.

> [!consider] Direct Links vs. Shared Mediums
> One solution to the shared medium problem is to establish **direct, dedicated links between nodes**. This eliminates interference and ensures secure communication. However, this approach is **expensive and doesn't scale** well as the number of devices increases.
> 
> An alternative is to use **shared broadcast links**, where all devices communicate over the same medium. This is more **cost-effective and scalable** but introduces the need for coordination to avoid **collisions** and ensure successful data transmission.

> [!idea] MAC Protocol
> The goal of MAC protocols is to achieve:
> - **Efficiency**: Maximize the utilization of the available bandwidth.
> - **Fairness**: Ensure that all nodes have equal opportunities to access the channel.
> - **Simplicity**: Minimize the complexity of the protocol implementation.
> - **Decentralization**: Enable distributed operation without relying on a central coordinator.
> 
> MAC protocols can be broadly classified into three categories:
> 
> 1. **Channel Partitioning**: Divides the available bandwidth into smaller channels, each allocated to a single node. Examples include TDMA and FDMA.
> 
> 2. **Random Access**: Allows nodes to access the channel randomly when they have data to send. Examples include ALOHA and CSMA. Collisions need to be recovered from. 
> 
> 3. **Taking Turns**: Allocates the channel to nodes in a round-robin fashion, allowing each node to transmit for a specific duration. Examples include polling and token-passing protocols.

> A diagram showing the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band divided into multiple non-overlapping channels (e.g., channels 1, 6, and 11), each occupying a specific frequency range.
> ```
> 
> Wi-Fi networks operating in the 2.4 GHz band use a form of FDMA to divide the available frequency spectrum into multiple non-overlapping channels. Each channel occupies a specific frequency range, allowing multiple devices to communicate simultaneously without interference.
> 
> - The 2.4 GHz band is divided into 14 channels, each 22 MHz wide.
> - However, adjacent channels partially overlap, so only channels 1, 6, and 11 are typically used to avoid interference.
> - Devices within range of each other can communicate on different channels simultaneously.
> - Access points and devices choose the least congested channel to minimize interference.
> - Multiple access points in the same area should use different channels to maximize performance.
> 
> By dividing the available frequency spectrum into separate channels, Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz employs FDMA principles to enable multiple devices to communicate concurrently, improving overall network efficiency and capacity.
