> [!motivation] Need for Local Data Sharing
>
> Within organizations and localized environments, there was a growing **need to efficiently share data, resources, and enable communication among computers and devices in close proximity**. Traditional methods of data transfer were cumbersome and inefficient, prompting the development of Local Area Networks (LANs).

> [!idea] Local Area Network (LAN)
>
> A LAN is a **computer network that interconnects devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office** or campus. LANs facilitate high-speed data communication, resource sharing, and collaborative work among users and systems within the local environment.

> [!idea] Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
>
> ARP maps logical IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a LAN. Devices use ARP to discover the MAC address associated with a target IP address, enabling accurate data frame delivery between devices on the same LAN segment.
