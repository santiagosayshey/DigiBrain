> [!motivation] Downsides of Immutability
> 
> Traditional networking architectures (Distance Vector, Link State) while stable, lacks the flexibility to adapt to dynamic network conditions or to implement complex routing policies. **Consider a scenario where a business needs to ensure sensitive data does not travel through specific geopolitical regions**, a task that traditional methods struggle with due to their rigidity.

> [!idea] Software Defined Networking (SDN)
> 
> Software Defined Networking (SDN) **simplifies network management by using a single control system for the entire network**, rather than separate controls for each network component.

> [!example] Example: Implementing Security-Sensitive Routing with SDN
> 
> Imagine a multinational corporation needing to route sensitive data in a manner that avoids certain jurisdictions, such as avoiding data routing through China due to privacy concerns. With traditional networking, this would be complex and inflexible. However, SDN allows the network administrator to define a custom routing policy through the central controller. 
> 
> By using SDN, the administrator can specify that all packets containing sensitive data are routed through specific paths that exclude certain nodes or regions. This can be done dynamically and adjusted as the geopolitical or network landscape changes, showcasing SDN's adaptability.
> 
> ![[SDN Route.png|500]]
> 
> In this diagram, we can see that the shortest path does not work because its routed through E. The SDN can choose another route which is safe (but a bit longer).

> [!idea] SDN Process Overview
>
> SDN centralizes network control, allowing for quick adaptation to changes, unlike traditional networking's distributed approach. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview:
>
> 1. **Handling Table Misses**: When a device detects a packet that doesn't match any rule in its flow table, it sends the packet to the SDN controller. The controller then provides a rule for handling this and similar future packets.
>
> 2. **Establishing Secure Routes**: The controller proactively updates flow tables based on policy changes or security requirements to ensure data travels through secure routes.
>
> 3. **Topology Change Response**: Upon detecting network topology changes, the SDN controller recalculates paths and updates flow tables in affected devices to maintain efficient routing.
>
> This structure allows SDN to dynamically manage network operations, ensuring they remain optimized and secure.

> [!idea] General Forwarding and the Flow Table
>
> In Software Defined Networking (SDN), general forwarding is the process where packets are directed through the network based on rules specified in a flow table. The flow table is an essential component of SDN, **acting as the "brain" of each node in the network**. It contains a set of rules that **determine how each packet should be handled**.
>
> Here's a simplified structure of a flow table:
>
> | Field              | Description                                          |
> |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
> | Match Criteria     | Conditions to match the incoming packet (e.g., IP address, port, protocol). |
> | Priority           | Determines the order of rule application when multiple rules match. Higher numbers indicate higher priority. |
> | Actions            | Specifies what to do with a matched packet (e.g., forward, drop, modify). |
> | Counters           | Tracks statistics like the number of matched packets. |
> | Timeout            | Optional field that specifies how long the rule should remain in the flow table before expiring. |
>
> This design allows SDN to dynamically manage network traffic, optimize paths, and implement complex policies, such as routing around specific geopolitical regions or handling network congestion intelligently.
