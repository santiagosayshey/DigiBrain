> [!motivation] Downsides of Immutability
> 
> Traditional networking architectures (Distance Vector, Link State) while stable, lacks the flexibility to adapt to dynamic network conditions or to implement complex routing policies. **Consider a scenario where a business needs to ensure sensitive data does not travel through specific geopolitical regions**, a task that traditional methods struggle with due to their rigidity.

> [!idea] Software Defined Networking (SDN)
> 
> Software Defined Networking (SDN) **simplifies network management by using a single control system for the entire network**, rather than separate controls for each network component.
> 
> Generalized forwarding in SDN employs **flow tables to direct traffic, allowing dynamic adjustments to network behavior based on real-time conditions.** This approach decouples the network's data plane from the control plane.
> 
> **Process of Packet Handling in SDN:**
> 
> 1. **Packet Arrival**: When a packet arrives at a switch, the switch examines the packet's header, which includes information like source and destination addresses, port numbers, and protocol type.
> 
> 2. **Flow Table Lookup**: The switch consults its flow table to determine what to do with the packet. The flow table contains entries with match fields (to compare against packet headers), counters (for statistics), and actions (instructions on what to do with the packet).
> 
> 3. **Action Execution**: If a matching entry is found, the switch executes the specified actions, such as forwarding the packet, modifying the packet, or dropping it.
> 
> 4. **No Match Found**: If no matching entry is found, the packet is forwarded to the controller for further instructions.
> 
> 5. **Controller Decision**: The controller analyses the packet and the current network state to determine the appropriate action, which might include updating the flow table with a new rule for similar packets or defining secure routes.
> 
> **Handling Topology Changes and Network-Defined Information:**
> 
> When the network topology changes or specific network-defined information like secure routes is introduced, the **SDN controller updates the flow tables in the switches**. This ensures that the network adapts to changes and enforces security policies efficiently, rerouting traffic and applying necessary security measures to maintain integrity and performance.

> [!example] Example: Implementing Security-Sensitive Routing with SDN
> 
> Imagine a multinational corporation needing to route sensitive data in a manner that avoids certain jurisdictions, such as avoiding data routing through China due to privacy concerns. With traditional networking, this would be complex and inflexible. However, SDN allows the network administrator to define a custom routing policy through the central controller. 
> 
> By using SDN, the administrator can specify that all packets containing sensitive data are routed through specific paths that exclude certain nodes or regions. This can be done dynamically and adjusted as the geopolitical or network landscape changes, showcasing SDN's adaptability.
> 
> ![[SDN Route.png|500]]
> 
> In this diagram, we can see that the shortest path does not work because its routed through E. The SDN can choose another route which is safe (but a bit longer).
