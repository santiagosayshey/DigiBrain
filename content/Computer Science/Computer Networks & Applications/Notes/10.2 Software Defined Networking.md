> [!motivation] Downsides of Immutability
> 
> Traditional networking architectures (Distance Vector, Link State) while stable, lacks the flexibility to adapt to dynamic network conditions or to implement complex routing policies. Consider a scenario where a business needs to ensure sensitive data does not travel through specific geopolitical regions, a task that traditional methods struggle with due to their rigidity.

> [!idea] The Core Concept of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
> 
> Software Defined Networking (SDN) revolutionizes traditional networking by decoupling the network control and forwarding functions, enabling the network to be programmatically configured by software applications. In SDN, a central controller manages the network, allowing for dynamic, automated, and more intelligent network management. This approach enables network operators to quickly adapt to changing network conditions and implement sophisticated routing policies. For instance, SDN can dynamically alter routes based on real-time data about network congestion, security threats, or compliance requirements.

> [!example] Example: Implementing Security-Sensitive Routing with SDN
> 
> Imagine a multinational corporation needing to route sensitive data in a manner that avoids certain jurisdictions, such as avoiding data routing through China due to privacy concerns. With traditional networking, this would be complex and inflexible. However, SDN allows the network administrator to define a custom routing policy through the central controller. 
> 
> By using SDN, the administrator can specify that all packets containing sensitive data are routed through specific paths that exclude certain nodes or regions. This can be done dynamically and adjusted as the geopolitical or network landscape changes, showcasing SDN's adaptability.
> 
> Here, a diagram could illustrate a network with nodes A, B, C, D, and E, where the path A-C-E is preferred for sensitive data over A-B-D-E due to security policies.

> [!consider] Further Considerations and Related Concepts in SDN
> 
> While SDN offers significant advantages in flexibility and control, it also introduces new considerations. For instance, the centralization of control in SDN can be a single point of failure if not managed correctly. Additionally, the integration of SDN with existing network infrastructure requires careful planning and potentially new security measures to protect the central controller. 
> 
> Related concepts include Network Function Virtualization (NFV), which complements SDN by virtualizing network services that were traditionally run on hardware appliances, further enhancing network flexibility and scalability.
