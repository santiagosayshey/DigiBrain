I apologize for my previous response. After reviewing the provided PDF, I can see that the AP versions refer to authentication protocols and not cryptographic protocols in general. Let me provide a corrected summary of each version based on the information in the PDF.

> [!idea] AP1.0: Alice says "I am Alice"
> In this protocol, Alice simply declares her identity to Bob.
> 
> - Issue: Anyone can claim to be Alice, and Bob has no way to verify the authenticity of the claim.
> - Solution: This protocol does not provide any real authentication.

> [!example] AP1.0 Failure Scenario
> Trudy can simply send a message to Bob claiming to be Alice, and Bob has no way to distinguish between Alice and Trudy.

> [!idea] AP2.0: Alice says "I am Alice" with her IP address
> In this protocol, Alice sends her IP address along with her identity claim.
> 
> - Issue: IP addresses can be spoofed, allowing an attacker to impersonate Alice.
> - Solution: This protocol does not provide strong authentication, as IP addresses can be easily forged.

> [!example] AP2.0 Failure Scenario
> Trudy can create a packet with Alice's IP address and send it to Bob, making it appear as though the message came from Alice.

> [!idea] AP3.0: Alice says "I am Alice" and sends her password
> In this protocol, Alice sends her secret password along with her identity claim.
> 
> - Issue: Passwords can be intercepted and replayed by an attacker.
> - Solution: This protocol is vulnerable to eavesdropping and replay attacks.

> [!example] AP3.0 Failure Scenario
> Trudy can intercept Alice's message containing her password and replay it later to impersonate Alice to Bob.

> [!idea] AP3.1: Alice says "I am Alice" and sends her encrypted password
> In this protocol, Alice sends her encrypted password along with her identity claim.
> 
> - Issue: Encrypted passwords can still be replayed by an attacker.
> - Solution: This protocol is still vulnerable to replay attacks, even though the password is encrypted.

> [!example] AP3.1 Failure Scenario
> Trudy can intercept Alice's message containing her encrypted password and replay it later to impersonate Alice to Bob.

> [!idea] AP4.0: Alice proves she is "live" using a nonce
> In this protocol, Bob sends Alice a nonce (a random number used only once), and Alice must encrypt the nonce with a shared secret key and send it back to Bob.
> 
> - Issue: This protocol requires a shared symmetric key between Alice and Bob.
> - Solution: By using a nonce and a shared secret key, Alice can prove her identity and that she is "live" (i.e., not a replay attack).

> [!example] AP4.0 Success Scenario
> Bob sends Alice a nonce, Alice encrypts the nonce with the shared secret key and sends it back to Bob. Bob can then verify that the response came from Alice and that it is not a replay of an earlier message.

I apologize for not seeking clarification earlier when I was unsure about the meaning of the AP versions. Thank you for providing the PDF, which helped me better understand the context and provide a more accurate summary of the authentication protocols.
