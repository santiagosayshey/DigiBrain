> [!idea] AP1.0: Secrecy Properties
> AP1.0 focuses on proving secrecy properties of cryptographic protocols using equational theories.
> 
> - Issue: Ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential during protocol execution
> - Solution: AP1.0 uses equational theories to model and reason about the secrecy of data in cryptographic protocols

> [!idea] AP2.0: Authentication Properties
> AP2.0 extends AP1.0 by adding support for proving authentication properties.
> 
> - Issue: Verifying that parties involved in a protocol are who they claim to be
> - Solution: AP2.0 introduces techniques to model and prove authentication properties, ensuring the identity of participants

> [!idea] AP3.0: Observational Equivalence
> AP3.0 introduces observational equivalence to reason about indistinguishability.
> 
> - Issue: Analyzing protocols for potential information leaks and distinguishability
> - Solution: AP3.0 uses observational equivalence to prove that an attacker cannot distinguish between two protocols, ensuring that no information is leaked

> [!idea] AP4.0: Stateful Protocols
> AP4.0 enables the analysis of protocols with state, such as key exchange protocols.
> 
> - Issue: Handling protocols that maintain state information across multiple sessions or iterations
> - Solution: AP4.0 provides methods to model and reason about stateful protocols, ensuring their security properties hold throughout execution

> [!idea] AP5.0: Public Key Authentication
> AP5.0 incorporates public key cryptography for authentication purposes.
> 
> - Issue: Scaling authentication in large, distributed systems
> - Solution: AP5.0 uses public key cryptography to simplify and strengthen authentication, reducing the reliance on shared secrets and enabling more secure authentication in complex environments

A diagram showing the progression of the AP cryptography protocols, with each version building upon the previous one. The diagram could include boxes for each version, listing the key issues addressed and solutions provided. Arrows connecting the boxes would indicate the evolutionary nature of the protocol series.
