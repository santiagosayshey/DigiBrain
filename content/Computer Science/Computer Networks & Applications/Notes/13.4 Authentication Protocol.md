I apologize for the oversight. Let me include AP5.0 in the revised response.

> [!example] AP4.0 Limitation Scenario
> Alice and Bob want to authenticate each other but do not have a pre-established shared symmetric key.

> [!idea] AP5.0: Using Public Key Cryptography
> Alice and Bob use public key cryptography for authentication, without requiring a pre-established shared key.

>   1. Bob sends Alice a message saying "I am Bob" and a nonce R.

> - Issue: AP5.0 is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and manipulate the communication between Alice and Bob.

> [!idea] Using Certified Public Keys
> To address the man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability in AP5.0, Alice and Bob can use certified public keys.
