>
> A broadcast address is a special IP address used to **send a packet to every device on a network** simultaneously. 
>
> The broadcast address is typically used for:
>
> 1. Network configuration: **Sending configuration information**, such as IP address assignments, to all devices on a network.
> 2. Service discovery: Allowing **devices to discover available services** on a network without prior knowledge of the specific IP addresses of the devices offering those services.
> 3. Routing updates: **Propagating routing information** to all devices on a network to maintain accurate routing tables.
>
> The broadcast address for a network is the address where **all host bits are set to 1**.
> - Additionally, it's common practice to reserve the all 0 bits for network identifier.
> - This  means that you **can't use the first or last host address** in any range. 

> [!example] Broadcast Address
>
> In classful addressing, 
>
> For example:
> - In a Class B network like `172.16.0.0`, the broadcast address is `172.16.255.255`.
>
> With CIDR, the broadcast address is calculated by setting all bits in the host portion of the address to 1.
>
> For example, consider the network `10.1.1.0/24`:
> - The network portion is the first 24 bits (`10.1.1`), and the host portion is the last 8 bits.
> - To find the broadcast address, set all host bits to 1: `10.1.1.255`.
