> [!idea] Reliable Data Transfer
> Many applications wants reliable data transfer, so many transport layer protocols provide it! The service level of the underlying network may vary, so the transport layer needs to deal with errors and loss of data packets.
> 
> **Start with the assumption that the network is reliable, and progressively add mechanisms to deal with errors.**
> 
> [[State Machines]] can be used to model and implement the behavior of transport layer protocols. The goal is to ensure that data is transferred correctly and completely, even in the presence of network errors or packet loss. We develop sender and receiver sides of this protocol in a unidirectional (1 way) manner.
>
> Here's how state machines can be applied:
>
> 1. 🔵 **States**: Define the different states that the transport layer protocol can be in. For example:
>    - "Waiting for data": The protocol is ready to receive data from the application layer.
>    - "Sending data": The protocol is actively sending data packets to the receiver.
>    - "Waiting for acknowledgment": The protocol is waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiver to confirm successful data transfer.
>    - "Retransmitting data": The protocol is resending data packets that were lost or corrupted during transmission.
>
> 2. ➡️ **Transitions**: Specify the transitions between states based on events or conditions. For instance:
>    - When data is available from the application layer, transition from "Waiting for data" to "Sending data."
>    - After sending a data packet, transition from "Sending data" to "Waiting for acknowledgment."
>    - If an acknowledgment is received, transition from "Waiting for acknowledgment" to "Waiting for data" (if there is no more data to send) or back to "Sending data" (if there is more data to send).
>    - If a timeout occurs while waiting for an acknowledgment, transition from "Waiting for acknowledgment" to "Retransmitting data."
>
> 3. 🎚️ **Inputs**: Define the inputs that trigger state transitions. In this case, inputs can include:
>    - Data available from the application layer.
>    - Acknowledgments received from the receiver.
>    - Timeouts indicating a lack of acknowledgment.
>
> 4. 🎛️ **Outputs**: Specify the actions or behaviors performed in each state. For example:
>    - In the "Sending data" state, the protocol encapsulates the data into packets and transmits them over the network.
>    - In the "Waiting for acknowledgment" state, the protocol starts a timer and waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver.
>    - In the "Retransmitting data" state, the protocol resends the unacknowledged data packets.

> - **Checksums**: The sender calculates a sum of the data bits and appends it as a header, allowing the receiver to recalculate the sum and compare it with the received checksum to verify the integrity of the data.

> But this introduces a new problem! We are transmitting duplicate data.
> - We fix this by adding a sequence number (ID) header to the packet, and this way the receiver can choose to disregard its contents if its the same as a previous one and send an ACK back.
> - We only need two numbers to identify retransmitted packets. A receiver checks the sequence number of each incoming packet. If the sequence number is new, the receiver processes the packet and sends an ACK. If the sequence number is the same as a previously received packet, the receiver discards the duplicate and sends an ACK. The sender and receiver alternate between sequence numbers 0 and 1 for each successful transmission.

> [!consider] RTD2.2 - NAK Free Protocol
Maybe we can we use a **single ACK to determine if the message was received or not**. We can do this by adding the SQ number to the ACK. Adding the right sequence number indicates an ACK, and the wrong one indicates a NAK.

> We can see that the biggest issue with RTD3.0 is selecting the right timeout duration. Too long and we're wasting time waiting to transmit. Too short and we lead to a bunch of duplicates. Eventually all of these will resolve but it does affect performance.

> [!consider] The Need for Pipelining in Reliable Data Transfer Protocols
> In high-speed networks with significant propagation delays and small packet sizes, the utilization of available bandwidth can be severely limited when using simple stop-and-wait protocols. Consider the following example:
> 
> - 1 Gbps link with 15 ms end-to-end propagation delay
> - 1 KB packet size
> - Packet transmission time (T_transmit) = 8 microseconds/packet
> - Sender utilization (U) = 0.00027 or 0.027%
> 
> In this scenario, even with a high-speed 1 Gbps link, the throughput is limited to only 33 KB/sec due to the propagation delay and small packet size. The sender spends most of its time waiting for acknowledgments (ACKs) before sending the next packet, resulting in poor utilization of the available bandwidth.
> 
> To address this issue, pipelining is introduced in reliable data transfer (RDT) protocols. [[Pipelining]] allows multiple data packets to be in transit simultaneously, without waiting for individual ACKs. By leveraging sequence numbers, timers, and efficient retransmission mechanisms, pipelining enables the sender to fully utilize the available bandwidth and significantly improve throughput.
> 
> Pipelining is a crucial technique in advanced RDT protocols, as it overcomes the limitations of simple stop-and-wait approaches and ensures efficient data transfer in high-speed networks with substantial propagation delays.
