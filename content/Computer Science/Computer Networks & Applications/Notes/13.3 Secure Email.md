> [!motivation] Secure Communication Via Email
>
> Email has become an essential communication tool in personal and professional domains, **enabling the exchange of information** globally. However, the open nature of email systems and the Internet poses several security risks:
>
> - Confidentiality: **Unencrypted email messages can be intercepted** and read by unauthorized parties during transmission or storage.
> - Authentication: Without proper authentication mechanisms, it is **difficult to verify the true identity of the sender**, making email vulnerable to spoofing and impersonation attacks.
> - Message Integrity: **Unprotected email messages can be altered** or tampered with during transit, compromising the integrity of the information.
> - Access and Availability: **Email servers and systems can be targeted by denial-of-service** attacks, disrupting the availability of communication channels.
>
> Addressing these security concerns is crucial to ensure the privacy, authenticity, and reliability of email communication.

> [!idea] Cryptography for Secure Email
>
> Cryptography provides a set of **techniques and principles that address the security concern**s outlined in the motivation callout, enabling secure email communication:
> 
> Key cryptographic terminology:
> - **Encryption**: The process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and a secret key.
> - **Decryption**: The reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate decryption key.
> - **Symmetric Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms that use the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.
> - **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Cryptographic algorithms that use a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
> - **Digital Signature**: A cryptographic mechanism that uses asymmetric cryptography to provide authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.

> [!example] Applying Cryptography to Secure Email
>
> To secure email communication using cryptography, the following steps can be taken:
>
> 1. **Encryption**: Alice encrypts her email message using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) and a randomly generated session key.
> 2. **Key Exchange**: Alice encrypts the session key using Bob's public key (asymmetric cryptography) and includes it with the encrypted message.
> 3. **Digital Signature**: Alice creates a digital signature of the encrypted message and the encrypted session key using her private key.
> 4. **Email Transmission**: Alice sends the encrypted message, encrypted session key, and digital signature to Bob.
> 5. **Verification and Decryption**: Bob uses Alice's public key to verify the digital signature, ensuring the message's integrity and authenticity. He then uses his private key to decrypt the session key, and finally, the session key to decrypt the message.
>
> This approach ensures the confidentiality of the email message (through encryption), authentication of the sender (through digital signatures), and message integrity (through digital signatures and hash functions).

> [!consider] Public Algorithms, Private Keys
>
> In cryptographic systems, a widely accepted principle is to use **publicly available algorithms while keeping the keys private**. 
>
> - Cryptographic algorithms are publicly available for review and analysis by the security community
> - This promotes transparency and allows scrutiny to increase confidence in the algorithms' robustness
> - Security relies on keeping the encryption/decryption keys private, not secrecy of the algorithm itself
> - Public algorithms enable interoperability across different systems and implementations
>
> - Keeping keys private is generally easier to achieve than attempting to keep the entire algorithm secret
> - Secrecy of the algorithm alone is considered a weak practice, known as "security through obscurity"
