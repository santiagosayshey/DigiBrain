> [!motivation] Secure Communication Via Email
>
> Email has become an essential communication tool in personal and professional domains, **enabling the exchange of information** globally. However, the open nature of email systems and the Internet poses several security risks:
>
> - Confidentiality: **Unencrypted email messages can be intercepted** and read by unauthorized parties during transmission or storage.
> - Authentication: Without proper authentication mechanisms, it is difficult to verify the true identity of the sender, making email vulnerable to spoofing and impersonation attacks.
> - Message Integrity: Unprotected email messages can be altered or tampered with during transit, compromising the integrity of the information.
> - Access and Availability: Email servers and systems can be targeted by denial-of-service attacks, disrupting the availability of communication channels.
>
> Addressing these security concerns is crucial to ensure the privacy, authenticity, and reliability of email communication.
