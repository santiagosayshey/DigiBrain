> [!motivation] Challenges of Global Internet Routing
> 
> The Internet's sheer size, with billions of devices, makes traditional routing algorithms like **Dijkstra's impractical due to computational and memory** constraints. Efficient global routing **requires solutions that manage diverse paths**, policies, and administrative domains without overwhelming network resources.


> [!idea] Intra-AS and Inter-AS Routing Explained
> 
> Global routing is divided into Intra-AS and Inter-AS routing. Intra-AS routing, using protocols like OSPF and RIP, manages routes within a single Autonomous System (AS). Inter-AS routing, primarily through BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), handles routes between different ASes, allowing each AS to set its routing policies and ensure scalability across the global Internet.


> [!example] Routing Across Autonomous Systems: A Practical Scenario
> 
> Imagine an email traveling from a server in the U.S. to one in Europe. Intra-AS routing with OSPF determines the best path within the U.S. server's local network. When the packet reaches the network's edge, Inter-AS routing via BGP selects the optimal path through various ASes until the packet arrives at the European server. This combination of IGP and EGP efficiently manages complex global networks.


> [!consider] Broader Implications and Security in Global Routing
> 
> Global routing requires balancing policy, efficiency, and security. BGP's policy-based routing lets ASes tailor route selection based on business and technical needs. Route summarization in IGP reduces routing table sizes, enhancing performance. Security is paramount, as incorrect or malicious routing can disrupt global connectivity.
