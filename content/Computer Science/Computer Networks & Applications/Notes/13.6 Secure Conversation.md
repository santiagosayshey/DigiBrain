> [!example] Secure Message Authentication Process
> Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. They will use a combination of symmetric encryption, public-key cryptography, and a trusted certification authority (CA).
>
> 1. Certificate Acquisition:
>    - Alice and Bob each generate a public-private key pair.
>    - They register their public keys with the trusted CA, providing proof of their identities.
>    - The CA verifies their identities and creates digital certificates that bind their identities to their respective public keys.
>
> 2. Message Encryption and Signing:
>    - Alice creates a message she wants to send to Bob.
>    - Alice generates a unique session key (symmetric key) for this communication.
>    - Alice encrypts the message using the session key.
>    - Alice encrypts the session key using Bob's public key, obtained from his digital certificate.
>    - Alice creates a digital signature by hashing the encrypted message and encrypting the hash with her private key.
>
> 3. Message Transmission:
>    - Alice sends the encrypted message, encrypted session key, and her digital signature to Bob.
>
> 4. Message Authentication and Decryption:
>    - Bob receives the encrypted message, encrypted session key, and Alice's digital signature.
>    - Bob verifies Alice's digital certificate with the CA to ensure the authenticity of her public key.
>    - Bob decrypts the encrypted session key using his private key.
>    - Bob decrypts the encrypted message using the decrypted session key.
>    - Bob computes the hash of the decrypted message.
>    - Bob decrypts Alice's digital signature using her public key and compares the decrypted hash with the computed hash.
>    - If the hashes match, Bob confirms that the message originated from Alice (authentication) and has not been altered (integrity).
>
> This process combines various cryptographic primitives to ensure secure communication between Alice and Bob, providing confidentiality through encryption, authentication through digital signatures and certificates, and integrity through hashing.
