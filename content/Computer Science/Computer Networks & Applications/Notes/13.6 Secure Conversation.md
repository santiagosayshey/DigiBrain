> [!example] Secure Message Authentication Process
> Alice wants to send the message "Dear Bob, I love you" to Bob securely, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
>
> 1. Key Generation and Certificate Acquisition:
>    - Alice generates a public-private key pair: (Alice_pub, Alice_priv)
>    - Bob generates a public-private key pair: (Bob_pub, Bob_priv)
>    - Alice and Bob register their public keys with the trusted CA, providing proof of their identities.
>    - The CA issues digital certificates certifying the ownership of the public keys.
>
> 2. Message Encryption and Signing:
>    - Alice's message: "Dear Bob, I love you"
>    - Alice generates a symmetric key: Sym_Key
>    - Alice encrypts the message using Sym_Key:
>      Encrypted_Message = Encrypt("Dear Bob, I love you", Sym_Key)
>    - Alice encrypts Sym_Key using Bob's public key:
>      Encrypted_Sym_Key = Encrypt(Sym_Key, Bob_pub)
>    - Alice creates a digital signature by signing the encrypted message with her private key:
>      Signature = Sign(Encrypted_Message, Alice_priv)
>
> 3. Message Transmission:
>    - Alice sends the following to Bob:
>      - Encrypted_Message
>      - Encrypted_Sym_Key
>      - Signature
>
> 4. Message Authentication and Decryption:
>    - Bob receives Encrypted_Message, Encrypted_Sym_Key, and Signature.
>    - Bob verifies Alice's digital certificate with the CA to ensure the authenticity of her public key.
>    - Bob decrypts the encrypted symmetric key using his private key:
>      Sym_Key = Decrypt(Encrypted_Sym_Key, Bob_priv)
>    - Bob decrypts the encrypted message using the decrypted symmetric key:
>      Message = Decrypt(Encrypted_Message, Sym_Key)
>    - Bob verifies Alice's signature using her public key:
>      IsAuthentic = Verify(Encrypted_Message, Signature, Alice_pub)
>
> If the signature verification succeeds, Bob can be assured that the message "Dear Bob, I love you" indeed came from Alice (authentication) and has not been altered (integrity). The message content remains confidential throughout the process, as it is encrypted using the symmetric key, which is securely exchanged using Bob's public key.
