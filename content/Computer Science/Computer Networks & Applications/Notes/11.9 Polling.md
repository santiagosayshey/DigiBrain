> [!idea] Polling MAC Protocols
>
> In a polling MAC protocol, a central controller or master node initiates communication by **sending polling messages to each node in the network, inquiring if they have data** to transmit. The nodes respond to the poll, indicating whether they have data ready or not. Based on the responses, the c**entral controller grants transmission opportunities to the nodes that have data to send in a predetermined order.** 

> [!consider] Analogy to a Real-World Scenario
>
> Imagine a teacher (central controller) in a classroom wanting to give students a chance to ask questions or share their thoughts. Instead of calling on students directly, the teacher asks, "Does anyone have a question or comment?" (polling message). Students who wish to speak raise their hands (responding to the poll). The teacher then calls on the students with raised hands one by one, giving them the opportunity to speak (transmit data).

> [!example] Illustration of Polling MAC Protocol 
>
> Consider a network with a central controller and four nodes (A, B, C, D). The polling process may unfold as follows:
>
> 1. The controller broadcasts a polling message to all nodes.
> 2. Nodes A and C respond, indicating they have data to transmit.
> 3. The controller grants Node A the opportunity to transmit its data frames.
> 4. After Node A completes transmission, the controller polls again and grants Node C its transmission opportunity.
> 5. Nodes B and D did not respond initially, so they are not granted transmission opportunities in this polling cycle.
> 6. The controller continues to poll periodically, granting transmission opportunities based on node responses.

> [!consider] Drawbacks and Considerations for Polling MAC Protocols
>
> - **Overhead**: Constant exchange of polling messages and responses consume bandwidth.
> - **Latency**: Nodes may experience significant delays waiting for polling cycles.
> - **Single Point of Failure**: Failure of the central controller cripples the entire network.
> - **Fairness Issues**: Some nodes may experience longer delays or fewer transmission opportunities.
> - **Scalability Challenges**: Overhead and potential delays increase with more nodes.
> - **Synchronization Requirements**: Nodes must be synchronized with the central controller.
> - **Lack of Adaptability**: Difficulty adapting to dynamic network conditions or varying traffic loads.

> [!idea] Reservation-Based Distributed Polling MAC Protocols
>
> In reservation-based distributed polling protocols, time is divided into slots, with the first few slots being short "reservation" slots. During these reservation slots, **nodes contend to reserve future transmission slots by broadcasting a reservation request.** The reservation requests are received by all nodes, allowing them to build a schedule of upcoming transmissions.

> [!example] Illustration of Reservation-Based Distributed Polling
>  
> Consider a network with four nodes (A, B, C, D) and a time frame divided into 10 slots, with the first 2 slots being reservation slots.
>
> 1. During reservation slot 1, Node A broadcasts a reservation request for slot 5.
> 2. During reservation slot 2, Node C broadcasts a reservation request for slot 7.
> 3. All nodes receive these reservation requests and build a schedule: Slot 5 for Node A, Slot 7 for Node C.
> 4. When slot 5 arrives, Node A transmits its data frames without interference.
> 5. Similarly, when slot 7 arrives, Node C transmits its data frames.
> 6. The remaining slots are either unused or contended for during the next reservation period.

> [!consider] Advantages of Reservation-Based Distributed Polling
>
> - **Distributed Control**: There is no central controller, as nodes coordinate transmissions among themselves through the reservation process.
> - **Collision Avoidance**: By reserving future slots, nodes can transmit without collisions during their reserved slots.
> - **Efficient Bandwidth Utilization**: Nodes only contend for reservation slots, reducing the overhead of frequent polling messages.
> - **Adaptability**: The protocol can adapt to varying traffic loads by adjusting the number of reservation slots and their frequency.
> - **Fairness**: The reservation process ensures that all nodes have an equal opportunity to reserve transmission slots.
