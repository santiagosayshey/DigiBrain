> [!motivation] The Need for Ethernet
> In the early days of networking, the BUS topology, developed by Metcalfe, was a common approach. However, as network speeds increased, reaching 10Gbps and beyond, the limitations of this topology became evident.

> - The **BUS topology struggled to efficiently handle high-speed data transmission**
> - Collisions and data loss became more frequent as network traffic increased
> - A new solution was needed to ensure reliable and efficient communication in modern networks


> [!idea] Ethernet: A Standardized Network Communication Protocol
> Ethernet is a standardized communication protocol that **defines how network devices transmit data over a wired network**.
> - Enables devices to communicate with each other using a common language
> - Specifies the format and structure of data packets, known as Ethernet frames
>

> 
> - Key components of an Ethernet frame:
>   - Preamble: A sequence of alternating 1s and 0s that synchronizes the receiving device's clock
>   - Start Frame Delimiter (SFD): Indicates the start of the frame
>   - Destination and source MAC addresses
>   - EtherType field indicating the protocol being transported ( like how we use port number to tell where to send TCP / UDP packets)
>   - Payload containing the actual data being transmitted
>   - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection
> - Ethernet operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model

> [!example] Ethernet Communication Without a Preamble
> Imagine Device A sending a frame to Device B without a preamble:
> - Device B's clock is not synchronized with Device A's
> - Device B may misinterpret the start of the frame
>   - Incorrect sampling of the incoming signal
>   - Wrong interpretation of the frame's contents
> - If a collision occurs, it may not be detected promptly
>   - Data corruption and reduced efficiency




> [!example] Ethernet in Action
> Consider a typical office network setup:
> - Computers, printers, and servers are connected to Ethernet switches using Ethernet cables
> - When a computer wants to send data to a printer:
>   1. The computer creates an Ethernet frame containing the printer's MAC address and the data to be sent
>   2. The frame is transmitted through the Ethernet cable to the switch
>   3. The switch examines the destination MAC address and forwards the frame to the appropriate port connected to the printer
>   4. The printer receives the frame, extracts the data, and processes the print job
> - This process occurs seamlessly and efficiently, thanks to the standardized Ethernet protocol
