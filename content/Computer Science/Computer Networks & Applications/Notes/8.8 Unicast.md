>
> A unicast address is an IP address used to **send a packet to a single specific device** on a network.
>
> Unicast addresses are commonly used for:
>
> 1. Direct communication: **Sending data to a specific device**, such as a computer or a printer, on a network.
> 2. Point-to-point communication: Establishing **a direct connection** between two devices for data exchange.
> 3. Client-server communication: Facilitating **communication between clients and servers** in networked applications, such as web browsing or email exchange.
>
> Unicast addresses are unique to each device on a network and are typically assigned dynamically or statically by a network administrator.

> [!example] Unicast Address
>
> In classful addressing, unicast addresses are determined based on the class of the network.
>
> For example:
> - In a Class C network like `192.168.1.0`, a typical unicast address might be `192.168.1.100`, representing a specific device on the network.
>
> With CIDR, unicast addresses are assigned within a range allocated to a specific network.
>
> For example, consider the network `10.0.0.0/24`:
> - A unicast address within this network might be `10.0.0.50`, representing a specific device on the network.
