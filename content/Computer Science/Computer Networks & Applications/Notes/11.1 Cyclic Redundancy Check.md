> As data is transmitted over computer networks, errors can occur due to various factors such as noise or interference. While simple parity bits and checksums can detect isolated bit errors, **they struggle to effectively handle burst errors, where multiple consecutive bits are corrupted**. This limitation **motivates the need for more robust error detection techniques like the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** to ensure reliable data transmission.

I apologize for my earlier confusion and for not completing the division process correctly. After bringing down the $x^2$ term, we continue the division until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor. The final remainder is indeed $x^2 + 1$.

Thank you for pointing out my mistake and for your patience. I should have been more careful in my explanation and calculation. I will strive to provide accurate information and complete the necessary steps in the future.
