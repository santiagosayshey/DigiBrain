> [!idea] Multiple Access Links
> 
> Multiple access links are network links that **allow multiple nodes to connect and communicate over the same medium**.
> 
> **Point-to-Point Links**
> 
> Point-to-point links directly connect two nodes. They provide a **dedicated communication path between the two endpoints**, ensuring that the data sent is only accessible by these two nodes. Examples include direct wired connections between two computers or a dedicated **fiber optic line**.
> 
**Broadcast Links**
> 
> Broadcast links allow multiple nodes to share a single communication medium. In this type of network, any data sent by one node can be received by all other nodes on the same link. Examples of broadcast links include **Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks**.

> [!consider] Advantages and Disadvantages
> 
> - **Point-to-Point Links**: 
>   - *Advantages*: Dedicated bandwidth, secure communication.
>   - *Disadvantages*: Limited scalability, higher costs for extensive networks.
> - **Broadcast Links**: 
>   - *Advantages*: Cost-effective, easy to add new nodes.
>   - *Disadvantages*: Potential for collisions, reduced bandwidth with more nodes.

> [!example] Examples of Usage
> 
> - **Point-to-Point**: A leased line connection between two offices in different cities ensures dedicated and secure communication.
> - **Broadcast**: An office Ethernet network where all computers are connected to the same switch, enabling easy communication and resource sharing among all devices.
