> [!motivation] Need for Protocols in Shared Mediums
> 
> In network environments where **multiple nodes share the same communication medium**, such as in broadcast links, it is necessary to manage how these nodes access and use the medium. Without a proper protocol, **issues such as data collisions, communication failures, and inefficiencies can arise**. Protocols help to ensure orderly and efficient access to the medium, preventing these problems and optimizing overall network performance.

> [!idea] Multiple Access Links
> 
> Multiple access links are network links that allow multiple nodes to connect and communicate over the same medium
> 
> - **Point-to-point** links **directly connect** two nodes. They provide a dedicated communication path between the two endpoints, ensuring that the data sent is only accessible by these two nodes.
>
> - **Broadcast** links allow multiple nodes to **share a single communication medium**. In this type of network, any data sent by one node can be received by all other nodes on the same link..

> [!consider] Advantages and Disadvantages
> 
> - **Point-to-Point Links**: 
>   - *Advantages*: Dedicated bandwidth, secure communication.
>   - *Disadvantages*: Limited scalability, higher costs for extensive networks.
> - **Broadcast Links**: 
>   - *Advantages*: Cost-effective, easy to add new nodes.
>   - *Disadvantages*: Potential for collisions, reduced bandwidth with more nodes.

> [!example] Examples of Usage
> 
> - **Point-to-Point**: A leased line connection between two offices in different cities ensures dedicated and secure communication.
> - **Broadcast**: An office Ethernet network where all computers are connected to the same switch, enabling easy communication and resource sharing among all devices.

> [!idea] MAC (Media Access Control) Protocols
> 
> Media Access Control (MAC) protocols manage how multiple nodes share and access a common communication medium in broadcast networks. These protocols help prevent data collisions, ensure fair access to the network, and optimize overall network performance.
> 
> **Functions of MAC Protocols**
> 
> - **Collision Detection and Avoidance**: Ensuring that data packets do not collide on the network medium.
> - **Access Control**: Determining which node has the right to transmit data at any given time.
> - **Efficiency**: Maximizing the utilization of the shared medium to improve network throughput and performance.

> [!example] Examples of MAC Protocols
> 
> - **Ethernet (CSMA/CD)**: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection is used in wired Ethernet networks to detect and manage data collisions.
> - **Wi-Fi (CSMA/CA)**: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is used in wireless networks to avoid collisions by waiting for the medium to be clear before transmitting.
