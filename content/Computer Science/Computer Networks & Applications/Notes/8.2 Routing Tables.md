> [!consider] Routing Tables: Data and Control Planes
>
> Routers use routing tables in the **data plane** to **determine the best outgoing link for each incoming packet** based on its destination address.
>
> The **control plane** builds and **maintains these routing tables using routing protocols and algorithms** that exchange information between routers to create an accurate network topology view.
>
> The success of the network layer depends on both planes working efficiently. The control plane ensures routing tables are accurate and up-to-date, while the data plane uses this information to forward packets along optimal paths, minimizing latency and congestion. Issues in either plane can lead to packet loss, routing loops, and poor network performance.

> [!idea] Link State and Distance Vector Algorithms
>
> The control plane relies on routing algorithms to **build and maintain accurate routing tables**. The two fundamental types of routing algorithms are:
>
> 1. Link State Algorithms: Each router independently **builds a complete graph of the network topology** by sharing information about its directly connected links with all other routers. [[9.2 Dijkstra's Algorithm|Dijkstra's algorithm]] is then used to **calculate the shortest path to every destination**.
>
> 2. Distance Vector Algorithms: Each router **shares its routing table with its directly connected neighbors**. Routers **update their routing tables based on the information received from their neighbors**, iteratively converging on the best paths to each destination.
>
> Most modern routing protocols, such as OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP, are based on variations and optimizations of these two foundational algorithms, adapting them to specific network requirements and addressing their limitations.
