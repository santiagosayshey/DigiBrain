> [!consider] The Need for Pipelining in Reliable Data Transfer Protocols
>
> In high-speed networks with significant propagation delays and small packet sizes, **stop-and-wait protocols can severely limit bandwidth utilization**. For example, with a 1 Gbps link, 15 ms end-to-end propagation delay, and 1 KB packet size, the sender utilization is only 0.027%, resulting in a throughput of just 33 KB/sec.
>
> **Pipelining addresses this issue** by allowing multiple data packets to be in transit simultaneously, without waiting for individual ACKs. By using sequence numbers, timers, and efficient retransmission mechanisms, pipelining enables the sender to fully utilize the available bandwidth and significantly improve throughput.
>
> Pipelining has the following consequences for reliable data transfer protocols:
> - Increased range of sequence numbers to accommodate multiple in-transit packets
> - Buffering requirements for both sender and receiver
> - Dependence on the protocol's approach to handling lost, corrupted, or delayed packets (e.g., Go-Back-N or selective repeat)
>
> [[Pipelining]] is crucial in advanced RDT protocols to overcome the limitations of stop-and-wait approaches and ensure efficient data transfer in high-speed networks with substantial propagation delays.
