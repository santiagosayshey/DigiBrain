> [!idea] The Need for Pipelining in Reliable Data Transfer Protocols
>
> In high-speed networks with significant propagation delays and small packet sizes, **stop-and-wait protocols can severely limit bandwidth utilization**. For example, with a 1 Gbps link, 15 ms end-to-end propagation delay, and 1 KB packet size, the sender utilization is only 0.027%, resulting in a throughput of just 33 KB/sec.
>
> **Pipelining addresses this issue** by allowing multiple data packets to be in transit simultaneously, without waiting for individual ACKs. By using sequence numbers, timers, and efficient retransmission mechanisms, pipelining enables the sender to fully utilize the available bandwidth and significantly improve throughput.
>
> Pipelining has the following consequences for reliable data transfer protocols:
> - Increased range of sequence numbers to accommodate multiple in-transit packets
> - Buffering requirements for both sender and receiver
> - Dependence on the protocol's approach to handling lost, corrupted, or delayed packets (e.g., Go-Back-N or selective repeat)

> The window buffer is a region of memory allocated for temporary storage of data packets. Its size should be equal to the delay-bandwidth product to ensure that the sender can fully utilize the available bandwidth while waiting for acknowledgments. If the window buffer is too small, the sender will be unable to keep the pipeline full, leading to underutilization of the link. Conversely, if the window buffer is too large, it may lead to excessive memory usage and potential issues with flow control.

> [[Pipelining]] is crucial in advanced RDT protocols to overcome the limitations of stop-and-wait approaches and ensure efficient data transfer in high-speed networks with substantial propagation delays. By properly sizing the window buffer according to the delay-bandwidth product, reliable data transfer protocols can optimize throughput and efficiently utilize network resources.

> [!consider] Post Analogy
>
> Imagine sending letters to a distant friend. With a window, you can send multiple letters simultaneously, up to the window size, which is determined by the product of the round-trip delay and the available bandwidth (delay-bandwidth product). The window acts as a buffer, storing sent but unacknowledged letters, allowing you to keep the pipeline full and maximize your sending capacity. The primary purpose of the window buffer is to keep the communication link saturated at all times, ensuring that you are always sending letters at the maximum possible rate. This approach helps overcome the limitations of the slow and inefficient stop-and-wait method.
