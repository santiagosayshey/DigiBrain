> [!idea] IPv4 Addressing
>
> IPv4 addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **4 sets of 8-bit sections, separated by dots**. The address is divided into two parts:
>
> - **Higher-order bits**: Represent the network part of the address
> - **Lower-order bits**: Represent the host part of the address
>
> For example:
>
> ```plaintext
> IP Address 1: 192.168.1.10
> IP Address 2: 192.168.1.20
>                ├───────┬──┤
>                Network Host
> ```
>
> Both devices have the same higher-order bits (`192.168.1`), indicating they are part of the same network. The lower-order bits (`10` and `20`) uniquely identify each device within the network.

> [!consider] Geographic Zone Allocation of IP Addresses
>
> IP addresses are **assigned to networks based on their geographic zone**. This allows routers to quickly determine the origin of a packet by examining its network part, and reduce the complexity of routing tables. 
> 
> We could easily identify the link to send a packet by looking at the network part of its ip address.

> | North America| 192.0.0.0 - 193.255.255.255 |
> | Europe       | 194.0.0.0 - 195.255.255.255 |
> | Asia         | 196.0.0.0 - 197.255.255.255 |
> | Africa       | 198.0.0.0 - 199.255.255.255 |
> | South America| 200.0.0.0 - 201.255.255.255 |
> | Oceania      | 202.0.0.0 - 203.255.255.255 |
> | Others       | 204.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 |

> Each geographic zone receives an allocation of IP addresses - roughly 32 million each.
