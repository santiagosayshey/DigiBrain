> [!motivation] The Birth of IPv4
>
> The Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) was developed in the 1970s and became the standard for **identifying devices on the internet**. It introduced the concept of using a numerical **IP address to uniquely identify each device** connected to the network.
>
> IPv4 addressed the need for a standardized addressing scheme that could facilitate communication between different networks and devices across the emerging internet.

> [!idea] IPv4 Addressing
>
> IPv4 addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **4 sets of 8-bit sections, separated by dots**. The address is divided into two parts:
>
> - **Higher-order bits**: Represent the network part of the address
> - **Lower-order bits**: Represent the host part of the address
>
> For example:
>
> ```plaintext
> IP Address 1: 192.168.1.10
> IP Address 2: 192.168.1.20
> ├───────┬──┤
> Network Host
> ```
>
> Both devices have the same higher-order bits (`192.168.1`), indicating they are part of the same network. The lower-order bits (`10` and `20`) uniquely identify each device within the network.

> [!idea] Geographic Zone Allocation of IP Addresses
>
> IP addresses are **assigned to networks based on their geographic zone**. This allows routers to quickly determine the origin of a packet by examining its network part, and reduce the complexity of routing tables.
>
> We could easily identify the link to send a packet by looking at the network part of its IP address.

> | Region | IP Address Range |
> |--------------|-------------------------|
> | North America| 192.0.0.0 - 193.255.255.255 |
> | Europe | 194.0.0.0 - 195.255.255.255 |
> | Asia | 196.0.0.0 - 197.255.255.255 |
> | Africa | 198.0.0.0 - 199.255.255.255 |
> | South America| 200.0.0.0 - 201.255.255.255 |
> | Oceania | 202.0.0.0 - 203.255.255.255 |
> | Others | 204.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 |
> ```
>
> Each geographic zone receives an allocation of IP addresses - roughly 32 million each.

> [!consider] Drawbacks of IPv4 Addressing
>
> While IPv4 served its purpose well for many years, its limitations became increasingly evident as the internet evolved:
>
> 1. **Limited Address Space**: With only 32 bits for addressing, IPv4 provided a finite pool of approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, which proved insufficient for the rapidly growing number of internet-connected devices.
>
> 2. **Address Exhaustion**: The depletion of available IPv4 addresses led to the need for address conservation techniques like Network Address Translation (NAT), which introduced complexities and limitations in networking and application development.
>
> 3. **Inefficient Routing**: The classful addressing model in IPv4 resulted in inefficient use of address space and complicated routing tables, making network management and routing more complex.
>
> 4. **Lack of Security Features**: IPv4 lacked built-in security features, leading to the need for additional protocols and mechanisms to ensure secure communication and protect against threats.
>
> 5. **Limited Support for New Technologies**: The limited address space and lack of inherent support for features like auto-configuration made it challenging for IPv4 to adapt to emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile computing.
