> [!idea] Reservation-Based Distributed Polling MAC Protocols
>
> In reservation-based distributed polling protocols, time is divided into slots, with the first few slots being short "reservation" slots. During these reservation slots, **nodes contend to reserve future transmission slots by broadcasting a reservation request.** The reservation requests are received by all nodes, allowing them to build a schedule of upcoming transmissions.

> [!example] Illustration of Reservation-Based Distributed Polling
>  
> Consider a network with four nodes (A, B, C, D) and a time frame divided into 10 slots, with the first 2 slots being reservation slots.
>
> 1. During reservation slot 1, Node A broadcasts a reservation request for slot 5.
> 2. During reservation slot 2, Node C broadcasts a reservation request for slot 7.
> 3. All nodes receive these reservation requests and build a schedule: Slot 5 for Node A, Slot 7 for Node C.
> 4. When slot 5 arrives, Node A transmits its data frames without interference.
> 5. Similarly, when slot 7 arrives, Node C transmits its data frames.
> 6. The remaining slots are either unused or contended for during the next reservation period.

> [!consider] Advantages of Reservation-Based Distributed Polling
>
> - **Distributed Control**: There is no central controller, as nodes coordinate transmissions among themselves through the reservation process.
> - **Collision Avoidance**: By reserving future slots, nodes can transmit without collisions during their reserved slots.
> - **Efficient Bandwidth Utilization**: Nodes only contend for reservation slots, reducing the overhead of frequent polling messages.
> - **Adaptability**: The protocol can adapt to varying traffic loads by adjusting the number of reservation slots and their frequency.
> - **Fairness**: The reservation process ensures that all nodes have an equal opportunity to reserve transmission slots.
