> | Scenario | Problem |
> |----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
> | Large packet vs. small MTU | Packet dropped, communication failure |
> | Application complexity | High, need to adapt to varying MTUs |
> | Network efficiency | Low, limited by smallest MTU in path |

> Without a solution, network communication would be unreliable and inefficient.

> [!idea] IP Fragmentation
>
> IP fragmentation is the process of **breaking down large IP packets into smaller pieces** (fragments) to fit the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the network. This allows data to be transmitted across networks with different MTU sizes.

> When a router receives an IP packet larger than the MTU of the outgoing link:
> 1. The router **divides the packet** into smaller fragments.
> 2. Each fragment is assigned a unique identifier and offset value.
> 3. The fragments are **sent independently** to the destination.
> 4. The receiving **host reassembles** the fragments based on their identifiers and offsets.

> | Field | Description |
> |----------------|----------------------------------------------|
> | Identification | Unique identifier for the original datagram |
> | Flags | Indicates if more fragments follow |
> | Fragment Offset| Specifies the position of the fragment |

> [!example] IP Fragmentation in Action
>
> Consider a network with three links, each having a different MTU:
> - Link 1: MTU = 1500 bytes
> - Link 2: MTU = 1000 bytes
> - Link 3: MTU = 1500 bytes
>
> When a host sends a 1400-byte IP packet:
> 1. The packet traverses Link 1 without fragmentation.
> 2. At Link 2, the router fragments the packet into two pieces:
>    - Fragment 1: 976 bytes (1000 - IP header)
>    - Fragment 2: 424 bytes (remaining data)
> 3. The fragments are sent independently across Link 2.
> 4. At Link 3, the fragments are forwarded without further fragmentation.
> 5. The receiving host reassembles the fragments into the original 1400-byte packet.

> [!consider] Fragmentation Overhead and Issues
>
> - Fragmentation **increases overhead due to additional header** information.
> - If one fragment is lost, the entire packet must be retransmitted.
> - Fragmentation can be used in DoS attacks (e.g., ping of death).
> - IPv6 does not allow fragmentation by routers, only by the source host.

> [!idea] Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
>
> Path MTU Discovery is a technique used to **determine the maximum packet size that can be sent** without fragmentation across a network path. It helps optimize network performance by avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.
>
> 1. The source host sends a packet with the "Don't Fragment" (DF) flag set.
> 2. If a router along the path has an MTU smaller than the packet size, it drops the packet and sends an ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" message back to the source.
> 3. The source host adjusts its packet size based on the ICMP message and retransmits.
> 4. The process repeats until the packet reaches the destination without fragmentation.
