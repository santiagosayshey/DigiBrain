> [!motivation] The Problem of Varying MTU Sizes Across Networks
>
> Networks operate with varying Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) sizes, leading to several **issues when a host sends an IP packet larger than the outgoing link**'s MTU:
> - Such packets are often dropped, causing communication failures.
> - Applications need to adapt to varying MTUs, increasing complexity.
> - Network efficiency is compromised, constrained by the smallest MTU in the path.
> 
> A **mechanism to manage packets exceeding the MTU is crucial for network reliability** and efficiency.

> [!idea] IP Fragmentation
>
> IP fragmentation is the process of **breaking down large IP packets into smaller pieces** (fragments) to fit the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the network. This allows data to be transmitted across networks with different MTU sizes.
>
> When a router receives an IP packet larger than the MTU of the outgoing link:
> 1. The router **divides the packet** into smaller fragments.
> 2. Each fragment is assigned a unique identifier and offset value.
> 3. The fragments are **sent independently** to the destination.
> 4. The receiving **host reassembles** the fragments based on their identifiers and offsets.
> 
> The IP header contains several fields that are crucial for fragmentation and reassembly:
>
> | Field          | Description                                                          |
> |----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | Identification | A unique 16-bit value assigned by the sender to identify the original datagram. All fragments of the same datagram have the same identification number. |
> | Flags          | A 3-bit field used to control fragmentation. The relevant flags are: <br> - Don't Fragment (DF): When set, routers will not fragment the packet. <br> - More Fragments (MF): When set, it indicates that more fragments follow. The last fragment has this flag unset. |
> | Fragment Offset| A 13-bit field indicating the position of the fragment within the original datagram, measured in units of 8 bytes (64 bits). The first fragment has an offset of 0. |
> | Total Length   | A 16-bit field specifying the total length of the IP datagram, including the header and data, in bytes. Each fragment will have a different total length. |


> [!example] IP Fragmentation in Action
>
> Consider a network with three links, each having a different MTU:
> - Link 1: MTU = 1500 bytes
> - Link 2: MTU = 1000 bytes
> - Link 3: MTU = 1500 bytes
>
> When a host sends a 1400-byte IP packet:
> 1. The packet traverses Link 1 without fragmentation.
> 2. At Link 2, the router fragments the packet into two pieces:
>    - Fragment 1: 976 bytes (1000 - IP header)
>    - Fragment 2: 424 bytes (remaining data)
> 3. The fragments are sent independently across Link 2.
> 4. At Link 3, the fragments are forwarded without further fragmentation.
> 5. The receiving host reassembles the fragments into the original 1400-byte packet.
>
> ```
> [Host A]  ---> (1400 bytes) ---> [Router 1] ---> (976 bytes) --->  [Router 2] ---> (976 bytes) ---> [Host B]
>                                             ---> (424 bytes) --->              ---> (424 bytes) --->

> [!consider] Fragmentation Overhead and Issues
>
> - Fragmentation **increases overhead due to additional header** information.
> - If one fragment is lost, the entire packet must be retransmitted.
> - Fragmentation can be used in DoS attacks (e.g., ping of death).
> - IPv6 does not allow fragmentation by routers, only by the source host.

> [!idea] Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
>
> Path MTU Discovery is a technique used to **determine the maximum packet size that can be sent** without fragmentation across a network path. It helps optimize network performance by avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.
>
> 1. The source host sends a packet with the "Don't Fragment" (DF) flag set.
> 2. If a router along the path has an MTU smaller than the packet size, it drops the packet and sends an ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" message back to the source.
> 3. The source host adjusts its packet size based on the ICMP message and retransmits.
> 4. The process repeats until the packet reaches the destination without fragmentation.
