> [!motivation] The Need for Efficient Routing
> In large-scale networks, **traditional IP routing can become complex and inefficient due to the need to process long network addresses at each hop**. This can lead to increased latency and reduced network performance, especially in networks with a high volume of traffic. An optimized routing technique is needed to simplify the routing process and improve overall network efficiency.

> [!idea] MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
> MPLS is a routing technique that **directs data based on short path labels rather than long network addresses**, improving network packet forwarding speed and efficiency. Labels identify virtual links between distant nodes, allowing for simplified packet routing.
> - Uses labels to determine packet routes
> - Improves network performance
> - Simplifies routing process

> [!example] MPLS in Action
> Consider a packet traveling from Host A to Host B through an MPLS network:
> 1. Host A sends a packet to the ingress router (LER).
> 2. The LER assigns an MPLS label to the packet based on its destination and forwards it to the next LSR.
> 3. Each LSR uses the label to determine the next hop and replaces the label with a new one.
> 4. The packet reaches the egress router (LER), which removes the label and forwards the packet to Host B.

> [!consider] MPLS Benefits and Use Cases
> MPLS enables Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing critical traffic and supports Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure, isolated network communication. It also facilitates network traffic engineering for optimizing resource utilization and performance.
> - Commonly used in:
>   - Large-scale enterprise networks
>   - Service provider networks

> [!consider] MPLS Components
> MPLS networks consist of Label Switch Routers (LSRs) that perform label switching and Label Edge Routers (LERs) at the network edge that assign and remove labels. Packets are grouped into Forward Equivalence Classes (FECs) that receive the same treatment and forwarding decisions.
