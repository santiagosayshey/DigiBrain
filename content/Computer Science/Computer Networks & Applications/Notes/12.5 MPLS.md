> [!idea] MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
> MPLS is a routing technique that directs data based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, improving network packet forwarding speed and efficiency. Labels identify virtual links between distant nodes, allowing for simplified packet routing.
> - Uses labels to determine packet routes
> - Improves network performance
> - Simplifies routing process

> [!example] MPLS in Action
> In a large enterprise network with multiple branch offices, MPLS labels are assigned to packets at the edge of the MPLS network. These labels determine the packet's route, regardless of the underlying protocol. At each hop, the label is used to determine the next hop and a new label until the packet reaches its destination, where the label is removed.

> [!consider] MPLS Benefits and Use Cases
> MPLS enables Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing critical traffic and supports Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure, isolated network communication. It also facilitates network traffic engineering for optimizing resource utilization and performance.
> - Commonly used in:
>   - Large-scale enterprise networks
>   - Service provider networks

> [!consider] MPLS Components
> MPLS networks consist of Label Switch Routers (LSRs) that perform label switching and Label Edge Routers (LERs) at the network edge that assign and remove labels. Packets are grouped into Forward Equivalence Classes (FECs) that receive the same treatment and forwarding decisions.
