> [!motivation] The Need for Efficient Routing
> In large-scale networks, **traditional IP routing can become complex and inefficient due to the need to process long network addresses at each hop**. Routers perform longest prefix matching to determine the next hop, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This can lead to increased latency and reduced network performance, especially in networks with a high volume of traffic. An optimized routing technique is needed to simplify the routing process and improve overall network efficiency.

> [!idea] MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
> MPLS is a routing technique that **directs data based on short path labels rather than long network addresses**, improving network packet forwarding speed and efficiency. Labels identify virtual links between distant nodes, allowing for simplified packet routing.
> - Uses labels to determine packet routes, which is faster than longest prefix matching
> - **MPLS is added to the datagram between layer 2 and layer 3,** allowing the IP header to be retained while MPLS includes its own label information for efficient routing.
> 
> MPLS networks consist of Label Switch Routers (LSRs) that perform label switching and Label Edge Routers (LERs) at the network edge that assign and remove labels. 
> 
> | Component | Role |
> |-----------|------|
> | LSR | Forward packets to outgoing interfaces based **only** on label value |
> | LER | Assigns and removes labels and forwards packets to LSRs |


> [!example] MPLS in Action
> Consider a packet traveling from Host A to Host B through an MPLS network with the following topology:
> 
> ```
> Host A --- Ingress LER (R1) --- LSR (R2) --- LSR (R3) --- Egress LER (R4) --- Host B
> ```
> 
> Forwarding tables:
> 
> | Router | Incoming Label | Outgoing Label | Destination | Outgoing Interface |
> |--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
> | R1     | -              | 100            | Host B      | R1 -> R2          |
> | R2     | 100            | 200            | Host B      | R2 -> R3          |
> | R3     | 200            | 300            | Host B      | R3 -> R4          |
> | R4     | 300            | -              | Host B      | R4 -> Host B      |
> 
> Packet journey:
> 1. Host A sends an IP packet destined for Host B to the Ingress LER (R1).
> 2. R1 analyzes the packet's destination IP address and assigns an MPLS label (100) based on the corresponding FEC. R1 then encapsulates the packet with the MPLS header and forwards it to the next hop, R2, using the outgoing interface specified in its forwarding table.
> 3. R2 receives the MPLS-encapsulated packet and looks up the incoming label (100) in its forwarding table. R2 replaces the label with the outgoing label (200) and forwards the packet to the next hop, R3, using the specified outgoing interface.
> 4. R3 receives the packet, looks up the incoming label (200) in its forwarding table, swaps it with the outgoing label (300), and forwards the packet to the next hop, R4, using the corresponding outgoing interface.
> 5. R4, being the Egress LER, receives the packet and removes the MPLS header. It then forwards the original IP packet to its final destination, Host B, using the outgoing interface specified in its forwarding table.
> 
> Throughout this process, the LSRs (R2 and R3) make forwarding decisions based solely on the MPLS labels and the specified outgoing interfaces, without inspecting the underlying IP packet.

> [!idea] Flexible Routing and Traffic Engineering
> MPLS allows for flexible routing options, enabling network administrators to **define specific paths for different types of traffic based on various criteria**, not just the fastest path.
> - LSPs can be established based on quality of service (QoS), security requirements, or other administrative policies
> - Traffic can be routed through specific nodes or links to ensure security, performance, or compliance with service level agreements (SLAs)
> - Similar to Software-Defined Networking (SDN), MPLS provides granular control over network paths and resource utilization
> - The power of this lies in setting in AND out labels. We can define where a packet should be routed to based on the link it came from!

> [!idea] Fast Reroute (FRR) and Resilience
> MPLS supports Fast Reroute (FRR) mechanisms to e**nsure rapid recovery from network failures** and minimize disruptions to traffic flows.
> - **Backup LSPs are precomputed and pre-established for each primary LSP**
> - When a failure is detected, traffic is immediately switched to the backup LSP, minimizing packet loss and downtime
> - FRR can be implemented using various techniques, such as one-to-one backup, facility backup, and detour-based backup
> - Enhances network resilience and availability, especially in mission-critical environments
