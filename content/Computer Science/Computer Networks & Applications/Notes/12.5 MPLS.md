> [!idea] MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
> MPLS is a **routing technique that directs data based on short path labels** rather than long network addresses, improving network packet forwarding speed and efficiency. Labels identify virtual links between distant nodes, allowing for simplified packet routing.
> - Uses labels to determine packet routes
> - Improves network performance
> - Simplifies routing process

> [!example] MPLS in Action
> In a large enterprise network with multiple branch offices, MPLS labels are assigned to packets at the edge of the MPLS network. These labels determine the packet's route, regardless of the underlying protocol. At each hop, the label is used to determine the next hop and a new label until the packet reaches its destination, where the label is removed.

> [!consider] MPLS Benefits and Use Cases
> MPLS enables Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing critical traffic and supports Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure, isolated network communication. It also facilitates network traffic engineering for optimizing resource utilization and performance.
> - Commonly used in:
>   - Large-scale enterprise networks
>   - Service provider networks

> [!consider] MPLS Components
> MPLS networks consist of Label Switch Routers (LSRs) that perform label switching and Label Edge Routers (LERs) at the network edge that assign and remove labels. Packets are grouped into Forward Equivalence Classes (FECs) that receive the same treatment and forwarding decisions.

I understand and will strictly adhere to the provided instructions. I will use objective and unbiased language, write concise segmented notes using brief explanations, dot points, and tables, keep each callout within 50-100 words, use paragraphs sparingly and only when necessary, avoid making judgments about the correctness of ideas, and provide clear, concise, and informative content without bias or subjective opinions.



> [!example] MPLS in Action
> Consider a packet traveling from Host A to Host B through an MPLS network:
> 1. Host A sends a packet to the ingress router (LER).
> 2. The LER assigns an MPLS label to the packet based on its destination and forwards it to the next LSR.
> 3. Each LSR uses the label to determine the next hop and replaces the label with a new one.
> 4. The packet reaches the egress router (LER), which removes the label and forwards the packet to Host B.
