| Hosts (End Systems)  | Laptops, phones                            | Hosts or end systems are devices that use the network to send or receive data. They are the originators or final recipients of data in a network.                                                                                                                                          |
| Networking equipment | Routers, switches                          | Networking equipment is used to connect hosts and manage the flow of data across the network. Routers determine the best path for data, while switches connect devices within a single network segment, directing data based on MAC addresses.                                             |
| Links                | Fibre, copper cables, wireless connections | Links are the physical or wireless connections that form the network's infrastructure, enabling data transmission between devices. They have capacity, or *bandwidth*, which define how much stuff the link can communicate at one. Measured in $\frac{Bits}{Second}$ or carrying capacity |

| Description                        | A network switching technique in which data is sent in small packets that are routed independently over the network. Packets can take different paths to the destination, and the network uses protocols to determine the most efficient route for each packet. This approach allows multiple communications to coexist over a network, optimizing the use of available bandwidth. | A network switching technique where a dedicated communication circuit/path is established between two nodes for the duration of the connection. This path is exclusive and remains reserved, providing a consistent and stable bandwidth for the duration of the connection. |
| Issues                             | Potential issues include network congestion, packet loss, and security vulnerabilities due to the decentralized nature of packet routing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Issues may include inefficient use of bandwidth during idle periods, higher setup and maintenance costs, and susceptibility to single point failures.                                                                                                                        |
| Efficiency                         | Offers better sharing of transmission capacity due to dynamic allocation based on demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Less efficient as it reserves bandwidth per user, regardless of actual usage, leading to potential underutilization.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Implementation                     | Simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement due to its dynamic nature and no need for dedicated path establishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | More complex and costly because of the need to establish a dedicated path for the duration of the connection.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Capacity Sharing                   | Capacity is shared dynamically among users based on demand, allowing for more efficient use of the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Capacity is pre-allocated and fixed, leading to possible wastage when the dedicated bandwidth is not in use.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Suitability for Real-Time Services | Initially critiqued for variable and unpredictable delays which could affect real-time services. However, advancements have made it more viable for such services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Traditionally preferred for real-time services like telephone calls due to predictable and constant bandwidth.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Example 1                          | With packet switching, a 1 Mbps link can efficiently support more users (more than 35 users with a low probability of congestion) by dynamically allocating bandwidth.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | With circuit switching, the same 1 Mbps link can only support up to 10 users, as each user is allocated 100 kbps regardless of actual usage.                                                                                                                                 |
| Example 2                          | Allows a single user to fully utilize the link's capacity to send a burst of data quickly when other users are inactive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Restricts each user to a fixed portion of the bandwidth, resulting in inefficient use of the link when demand is uneven.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Trend                              | Increasingly prevalent in today's telecommunications networks, with many systems migrating towards packet switching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | While still in use, especially for certain real-time applications, the trend is moving away from circuit switching towards packet switching.                                                                                                                                 |


> [!idea] Expanding on The Idea - Protocol Layers
> Protocol layers organise the complex processes involved in networking into manageable, hierarchical layers. Each layer focuses on a specific aspect of the communication, providing services to the layers above it and relying on the services of the layers below. Essentially, each layer adds their own bits of information (headers) that tell the hardware how to send this message.

| Application | HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)                                      | Message  | When you type a website's URL into your browser and press Enter, your browser uses HTTP as an application layer protocol to request web pages from a server. This layer deals with the high-level interface to the network, specifying how applications request network services.                                                                  |
| Transport   | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)                                     | Segment  | TCP takes the HTTP request and breaks it into smaller packets, ensuring reliable transmission and correct order of these packets from your computer to the web server. It establishes a connection between your computer and the server, managing the data exchange.                                                                               |
