> [!motivation] The Need for Switches in Ethernet Networks
> As Ethernet networks grow, connecting more devices, the need for efficient data transmission and reduced network congestion becomes crucial. Imagine a scenario where multiple devices are connected to a single shared medium, leading to increased collisions and reduced network performance.

> [!idea] Switches: Enhancing Ethernet Network Performance
> Switches are link layer devices that enable efficient data transmission in Ethernet networks by:
> - Providing dedicated bandwidth for each connected device
> - Reducing collisions and network congestion
> - Enabling transparent, plug-and-play connectivity
> - Utilizing self-learning mechanisms to build and maintain MAC address tables

> [!example] Switch Operation in an Ethernet Network
> Consider a small office network with four devices connected to a switch:
> 
> ```image_goes_here
> ![[A simple network diagram showing four devices (PC1, PC2, Server1, and Printer1) connected to a central switch.]]
> ```
> 
> When PC1 sends data to Server1:
> 1. The switch receives the data on the port connected to PC1
> 2. It examines the destination MAC address and checks its MAC address table
> 3. If the destination MAC is known, the switch forwards the data only to the port associated with Server1
> 4. If the destination MAC is unknown, the switch floods the data to all ports except the one it arrived on
> 5. The switch learns the source MAC address of PC1 and associates it with the incoming port
>
> This process ensures efficient data delivery and reduces unnecessary network traffic.

> [!consider] Advanced Switch Features and Considerations
> - VLANs: Switches support Virtual LANs (VLANs) to logically segment networks and improve security
> - QoS: Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms help prioritize critical traffic
> - Port mirroring: Switches can duplicate traffic from one or more ports to another for monitoring and troubleshooting
> - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP): STP prevents loops in switched networks with redundant links
> - Power over Ethernet (PoE): Some switches can provide power to connected devices over Ethernet cables
