> [!motivation] The Need for Switches in Ethernet Networks
> As Ethernet networks grow, connecting more devices, the **need for efficient data transmission and reduced network congestion becomes crucial**. Imagine a scenario where multiple devices are connected to a single shared medium, leading to increased collisions and reduced network performance.

> [!idea] Switches: Enhancing Ethernet Network Performance
> Switches are link layer devices that **enable efficient data transmission in Ethernet networks** by:
> - Filtering: **Examining destination MAC addresses** to determine output ports
> - Storing: **Temporarily holding frames in buffer memory** before forwarding
> - Forwarding: **Sending frames to the appropriate output port** or flooding if destination MAC is unknown
> - Providing dedicated bandwidth, reducing collisions, and enabling plug-and-play connectivity
> - Utilizing self-learning to build and maintain MAC address tables**

> [!example] Switch Self-Learning Process
> Consider a switch with three connected devices: PC1, PC2, and Server1.
> 
> 1. Initially, the switch's MAC address table is empty.
> 
> 2. PC1 sends a frame to Server1:
>    - Source MAC: PC1_MAC, Destination MAC: Server1_MAC
>    - **Storing**: The switch temporarily stores the frame in its buffer memory.
>    - **Filtering**: The switch examines the destination MAC address (Server1_MAC) and checks its MAC address table.
>    - The switch adds PC1_MAC to its table, associated with the port where the frame arrived.
>    - **Forwarding**: Since Server1_MAC is not in its table, the switch floods the frame to all ports except the incoming port.
> 
> 3. Server1 receives the frame and sends a response to PC1:
>    - Source MAC: Server1_MAC, Destination MAC: PC1_MAC
>    - **Storing**: The switch temporarily stores the frame in its buffer memory.
>    - **Filtering**: The switch examines the destination MAC address (PC1_MAC) and checks its MAC address table.
>    - The switch adds Server1_MAC to its table, associated with the port where the frame arrived.
>    - **Forwarding**: The switch finds PC1_MAC in its table and forwards the frame only to PC1's port since it is known.
> 
> 4. PC2 sends a frame to Server1:
>    - Source MAC: PC2_MAC, Destination MAC: Server1_MAC
>    - **Storing**: The switch temporarily stores the frame in its buffer memory.
>    - **Filtering**: The switch examines the destination MAC address (Server1_MAC) and checks its MAC address table.
>    - The switch adds PC2_MAC to its table, associated with the port where the frame arrived.
>    - **Forwarding**: The switch finds Server1_MAC in its table and forwards the frame only to Server1's port since it is known.
> 
> Through this self-learning process, the switch builds and maintains its MAC address table, enabling efficient frame forwarding.

> [!consider] Python Code for Switch Operation
> ```python
> def process_frame(frame, incoming_port):
>     store_frame(frame)
>     
>     dst_mac = frame.destination_mac
>     
>     if dst_mac not in local_network:
>         drop_frame(frame)
>     else:
>         if dst_mac in mac_table:
>             destination_port = mac_table[dst_mac]
>         else:
>             destination_port = flood_all_ports
>         
>         forward_frame(frame, destination_port)
> ```
> 
> This Python code represents the simplified process of a switch's operation, including filtering, storing, and forwarding frames based on the destination MAC address and the MAC address table.


> [!exercise]+ Exercise 1
> How does the switch know that A' is reachable via interface 4 and B' is reachable via interface 5?
> 
> **Answer:**
> Flooding. When a packet arrives at a switch and the switch doesn't know where to send the packet, it will flood all interfaces (except the incoming interface). It will learn that interface x corresponds with MAC address y and store this in its MAC address table.  


> [!exercise]+ Exercise 2
> How are entries created and maintained in a switch table?
> 
> **Answer:**
> Tables include a MAC address, interface ID and TTL. Whenever we flood to find a new address, this entry is added to the table.
