> [!consider]+ **What Happens When a Network Router Is Overwhelmed by Data?**
> Imagine a scenario where a client sends data at a rate that exceeds the processing capacity of a network router. This overload can lead to significant network issues: the **router's buffer may fill up**, resulting in **dropped packets**, and as the queue lengthens, it causes **delays to increase**. 
> 
> This is **congestion**: **a state where the network resources are pushed beyond their limits**, disrupting the smooth flow of data.


> [!idea]+ **Congestion Avoidance Mechanisms**
> To prevent and manage congestion, networks employ various congestion avoidance mechanisms. These strategies are designed to maintain data flow efficiency and network stability before congestion becomes too severe. **Congestion avoidance** works by monitoring network traffic loads and adjusting the rate of data transmission accordingly. Techniques such as **TCP congestion control** algorithms adjust the window size dynamically based on the perceived network conditions, reducing the data rate when potential congestion is detected to prevent packet loss and excessive delays. This proactive approach helps ensure that the network operates within its capacity, maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
