> [!consider]+ **What Happens When a Network Router Is Overwhelmed by Data?**
> Imagine a scenario where a client sends data at a rate that exceeds the processing capacity of a network router. This overload can lead to significant network issues: the **router's buffer may fill up**, resulting in **dropped packets**, and as the queue lengthens, it causes **delays to increase**. 
> 
> This is **congestion**: **a state where the network resources are pushed beyond their limits**, disrupting the smooth flow of data.

> [!consider]+ **Reasons to Avoid Network Congestion**
> Network congestion not only slows down data transmission but also has broader implications for network performance:
> - **Limited Throughput**: Throughput is capped at **routers**. Sending data at rates higher than what the router can handle doesn't increase throughput; instead, it causes a bottleneck.
> - **Increased Delay**: Congestion significantly increases the average **delay**. As more packets are queued, the time taken for a packet to move through the network increases.
> - **Wasted Resources**: Retransmission of packets—whether dropped or delayed—adds unnecessary overhead to the network. If a packet is dropped, all the effort and resources used to transmit it thus far, including the efforts of earlier routers, are wasted.
> - **Degraded Performance**: As the level of congestion approaches the network's capacity, performance degrades exponentially. Avoiding congestion is essential to maintain the efficiency and reliability of network communication.

> [!idea]+ **Congestion Avoidance Mechanisms**
> To prevent and manage congestion, networks employ various congestion avoidance mechanisms. These strategies are designed to maintain data flow efficiency and network stability before congestion becomes too severe. **Congestion avoidance** works by monitoring network traffic loads and adjusting the rate of data transmission accordingly. Techniques such as **TCP congestion control** algorithms adjust the window size dynamically based on the perceived network conditions, reducing the data rate when potential congestion is detected to prevent packet loss and excessive delays. This proactive approach helps ensure that the network operates within its capacity, maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
