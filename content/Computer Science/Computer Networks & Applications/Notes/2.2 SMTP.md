> SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol used to send emails from one server to another. SMTP ensures that outgoing emails are properly routed from the sender's email server to the recipient's email server.

| Mail Servers              | These servers have mailboxes containing incoming messages for users and a message queue for outgoing (to be sent) mail messages. |
| Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) | This protocol is used between mail servers to send email messages. In this context, the client is the sending mail server and the "server" is the receiving mail server, which typically operates over TCP port 25. |
