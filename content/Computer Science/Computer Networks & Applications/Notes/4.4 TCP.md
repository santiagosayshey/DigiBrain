> [!idea] Reliable Data Transfer
> Many applications wants reliable data transfer, so many transport layer protocols provide it! The service level of the underlying network may vary, so the transport layer needs to deal with errors and loss of data packets.
> 
> **Start with the assumption that the network is reliable, and progressively add mechanisms to deal with errors.**
> 
> [[State Machines]] can be used to model and implement the behavior of transport layer protocols. The goal is to ensure that data is transferred correctly and completely, even in the presence of network errors or packet loss.
>
> Here's how state machines can be applied:
>
> 1. 🔵 **States**: Define the different states that the transport layer protocol can be in. For example:
>    - "Waiting for data": The protocol is ready to receive data from the application layer.
>    - "Sending data": The protocol is actively sending data packets to the receiver.
>    - "Waiting for acknowledgment": The protocol is waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiver to confirm successful data transfer.
>    - "Retransmitting data": The protocol is resending data packets that were lost or corrupted during transmission.
>
> 2. ➡️ **Transitions**: Specify the transitions between states based on events or conditions. For instance:
>    - When data is available from the application layer, transition from "Waiting for data" to "Sending data."
>    - After sending a data packet, transition from "Sending data" to "Waiting for acknowledgment."
>    - If an acknowledgment is received, transition from "Waiting for acknowledgment" to "Waiting for data" (if there is no more data to send) or back to "Sending data" (if there is more data to send).
>    - If a timeout occurs while waiting for an acknowledgment, transition from "Waiting for acknowledgment" to "Retransmitting data."
>
> 3. 🎚️ **Inputs**: Define the inputs that trigger state transitions. In this case, inputs can include:
>    - Data available from the application layer.
>    - Acknowledgments received from the receiver.
>    - Timeouts indicating a lack of acknowledgment.
>
> 4. 🎛️ **Outputs**: Specify the actions or behaviors performed in each state. For example:
>    - In the "Sending data" state, the protocol encapsulates the data into packets and transmits them over the network.
>    - In the "Waiting for acknowledgment" state, the protocol starts a timer and waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver.
>    - In the "Retransmitting data" state, the protocol resends the unacknowledged data packets.
