> [!idea]+ TCP Timeouts
>
> **Balance between efficiency and reliability:** 
> The philosophy of TCP timeouts is to minimize unnecessary retransmissions while still quickly recovering from lost segments. This is achieved by calculating a dynamic timeout based on the recent history of the network's round trip times (RTTs).
>
> **Mathematical Formulas and Terms:**
>
> EstimatedRTT calculation:
> $$ \text{EstimatedRTT} = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Previous EstimatedRTT} + \alpha \times \text{SampleRTT} $$
> Deviation calculation:
> $$ \text{Deviation} = (1 - \alpha) \times \text{Previous Deviation} + \alpha \times |\text{SampleRTT} - \text{EstimatedRTT}| $$
> Timeout setting:
> $$ \text{Timeout} = \text{EstimatedRTT} + 4 \times \text{Deviation} $$

> **Terms used in the formulas:**
>
> | Term             | Description                                                                                      |
> | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
> | EstimatedRTT     | The weighted average of previous RTT measurements.                                               |
> | Î± (alpha)        | The weight given to the latest RTT measurement (typically 0.125).                               |
> | SampleRTT        | The most recent measurement of the RTT.                                                          |
> | Deviation        | The weighted average of the absolute differences between EstimatedRTT and SampleRTT.             |
> | Timeout          | The calculated duration after which a TCP segment is considered lost and eligible for retransmit.|
>
> By understanding these terms and the formula, we can appreciate the adaptive nature of TCP timeout, which ensures both efficiency in network communication and reliability in data transmission.
