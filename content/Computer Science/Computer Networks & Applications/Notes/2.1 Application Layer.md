> | GET - Retrieves information from the server.                                                 | 100 - Continue: The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.       |
> | POST - Submits data to be processed to a server.                                             | 200 - OK: The request has succeeded.                                                                                       |
> | PUT - Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. | 300 - Multiple Choices: Multiple options for the resource that the client may follow.                                      |
> | DELETE - Removes all current representations of the target resource.                         | 400 - Bad Request: The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error.                      |
> | PATCH - Applies partial modifications to a resource.                                         | 500 - Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. |

| Connection Usage        | Each connection is used for only a single request and response.                                                    | Connections can be reused for multiple requests and responses.                                                   |
| Round-Trip Times (RTTs) | Requires two RTTs: one for the TCP handshake (connection establishment) and another for the HTTP request/response. | Reduces the number of RTTs, as the connection establishment overhead is incurred less frequently.                |
| Overhead                | Higher overhead due to establishing and closing connections for each request.                                      | Lower overhead and better utilization of the network.                                                            |
| Connection Management   | -                                                                                                                  | Introduces more complex connection management, such as the need for a timeout and connection closure mechanisms. |
