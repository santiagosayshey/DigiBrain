> [!idea] Internet Protocol and Network Interfaces
>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses. 
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.

> [!consider] Assigning IPs to Hosts
>
> When a **device connects** to a network, it requires a **unique IP address** to communicate. This assignment is done through:
>
> - **Static IP Assignment**: Admins manually hardcode addresses in a file. 
>
> - **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Servers automatically assign addresses upon connection.
>
> - **Link-local Addressing (IPv6)**: In IPv6, hosts generate addresses without DHCP, using MAC addresses or randomization for communication within a network segment.
>
> These methods provide unique identifiers for seamless communication within and across networks.

> [!idea] IPv4 Addressing
>
> IPv4 addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **4 sets of 8-bit sections, separated by dots**. The address is divided into two parts:
>
> - **Higher-order bits**: Represent the network part of the address
> - **Lower-order bits**: Represent the host part of the address
>
> For example:
>
> ```plaintext
> IP Address 1: 192.168.1.10
> IP Address 2: 192.168.1.20
>                ├───────┬──┤
>                Network Host
> ```
>
> Both devices have the same higher-order bits (`192.168.1`), indicating they are part of the same network. The lower-order bits (`10` and `20`) uniquely identify each device within the network.

> [!consider] Geographic Zone Allocation of IP Addresses
>
> IP addresses are **assigned to networks based on their geographic zone**. This allows routers to quickly determine the origin of a packet by examining its network part, and reduce the complexity of routing tables. 
> 
> We could easily identify the link to send a packet by looking at the network part of its ip address.
>
> ```plaintext
> | Region       | IP Address Range        |
> |--------------|-------------------------|
> | North America| 192.0.0.0 - 193.255.255.255 |
> | Europe       | 194.0.0.0 - 195.255.255.255 |
> | Asia         | 196.0.0.0 - 197.255.255.255 |
> | Africa       | 198.0.0.0 - 199.255.255.255 |
> | South America| 200.0.0.0 - 201.255.255.255 |
> | Oceania      | 202.0.0.0 - 203.255.255.255 |
> | Others       | 204.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 |
> ```
>
> Each geographic zone receives an allocation of IP addresses - roughly 32 million each.
