> [!idea] Internet Protocol and Network Interfaces
>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses.
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.

> [!idea] IPv4 Addressing
>
> IPv4 addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **4 sets of 8-bit sections, separated by dots**. The address is divided into two parts:
>
> - **Higher-order bits**: Represent the network part of the address
> - **Lower-order bits**: Represent the host part of the address
>
> For example:
>
> ```plaintext
> IP Address 1: 192.168.1.10
> IP Address 2: 192.168.1.20
>                ├───────┬──┤
>                Network Host
> ```
>
> Both devices have the same higher-order bits (`192.168.1`), indicating they are part of the same network. The lower-order bits (`10` and `20`) uniquely identify each device within the network.

> [!consider] Networks
> 
> Networks are:
>
> 1. A group of devices that can communicate directly without a router
> 2. Devices in the same network share the network part (higher-order bits) of their IP addresses
> 3. Devices in the same network that communicate using their IP addresses directly

> [!consider] Network and Host Parts of an IP Address
>
> How do we determine **where the network part ends and the host part begins?** What information do we need to make this distinction?
>
> In classful addressing, the division between the network and host parts of an IP address is determined by the address class:
>
> | Class | Network Bits | Host Bits | Address Range                              |
> |-------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------- |
> | A     | 8            | 24        | 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255                 |
> | B     | 16           | 16        | 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255               |
> | C     | 24           | 8         | 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255               |
> | D     | -            | -         | 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (Multicast)   |
> | E     | -            | -         | 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 (Experimental) |
>
> For example, if an IP address belongs to Class A, the first 8 bits (the first octet) represent the network part, while the remaining 24 bits (the last three octets) represent the host part.
>
> The University of Adelaide could be assigned a Class B IP address, such as 129.127.0.0, allowing for a large number of hosts within the university network. In this case, the first two octets (129.127) represent the network part, and the last two octets (0.0) represent the host part.


> [!example] Network over Time
> Over time, as the internet grew, the most desirable Class B addresses were used up. This led to a practice of assigning multiple Class C addresses to a single network to accommodate more hosts. However, this approach has several drawbacks:
>
> 1. Inefficient use of IP address space: Assigning multiple Class C addresses to a network results in many unused IP addresses, as each Class C network can only accommodate 254 hosts.
>
> 2. Increased routing table size: Each Class C network assigned to a single organization requires a separate entry in the routing tables of internet routers, leading to larger and less efficient routing tables.
>
> 3. Administrative overhead: Managing multiple Class C networks for a single organization can be more complex and time-consuming than managing a single, appropriately sized network.
