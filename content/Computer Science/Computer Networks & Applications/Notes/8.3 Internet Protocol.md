>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses.
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] IP Address Format
>
> IP addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **sets of 8 bit sections, separated by dots**. 
> 
> Since IPv4 addresses are 32 bits, they consist of four 8-bit sections:

> IPv6 addresses, on the other hand, are 128 bits and are divided into eight 16-bit sections. Each section is represented by four hexadecimal digits and separated by colons:

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
