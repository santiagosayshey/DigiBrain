>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a 32-bit address scheme.
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a 128-bit address scheme to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] IP Address Format
>
> IP addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **four sets of numbers separated by dots**, such as `192.168.1.1`. Each number in the set ranges from 0 to 255, accounting for one byte of the 32-bit total address. This notation 

> [!example] Example of an IP Address

> [!idea] IPv4
>
> IPv4 uses **32-bit address system** that allows for over **four billion unique addresses**. Its widespread use and the simplicity of its addressing system have been pivotal in the initial expansion of the Internet. Despite the development of IPv6, IPv4 continues to be extensively used across global networks.
