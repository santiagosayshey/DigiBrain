>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.

> [!consider] IP Address Format
>
> Consider the format of IP addresses using **dotted decimal notation**, where an IP address is represented as four sets of numbers separated by dots, such as `192.168.1.1`. Each set ranges from 0 to 255 and represents one byte of the 32-bit total address. This notation simplifies reading and understanding the binary addresses that computers use.

> [!example] Example of IP Address
>
> An example of an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation is:
>
> ```plaintext
> 192.168.0.1
> ```
>
> This address format is commonly used in home and small office networks. Each segment of the address can vary depending on the network configuration, allowing for numerous unique addresses within the same network.

> [!consider] Versions of Internet Protocol
>
> Reflect on the evolution of Internet Protocol versions, primarily IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4, with its 32-bit addressing, can accommodate over four billion unique addresses, but has reached its limit due to the growth of the internet. IPv6, introduced to tackle this limitation, uses 128-bit addresses, greatly expanding the number of possible addresses and improving routing efficiency and security.
