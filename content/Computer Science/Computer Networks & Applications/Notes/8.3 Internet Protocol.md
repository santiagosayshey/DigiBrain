> [!idea] Internet Protocol and Network Interfaces
>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses. 
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.


> [!idea] IP Datagram Routing: Source to Destination
>
> IP datagrams are routed based on the destination IP address in the header:
>
> 1. **Source Host**: Creates the datagram and checks its routing table to determine if the destination is local or remote.
>
> 2. **Direct Delivery**: If destination is on the same address, sends the datagram directly to the destination host using its MAC address (ARP).
>
> 3. **Router Forwarding**: If remote, sends the datagram to the default gateway, which forwards it to the next router based on its routing table.
>
> 4. **Hop-by-Hop Routing**: The datagram is forwarded router-to-router until it reaches the destination network.
>
> 5. **Final Router**: Forwards the datagram to the destination host on the local network.
>
> 6. **Destination Host**: Receives the datagram, completing the journey.


> [!consider] Routing Tables
>
> Each device maintains a routing table to determine how to handle incoming and outgoing datagrams, enabling informed forwarding decisions.


> [!consider] IP Datagram Remains Unchanged During Transit
>
> The IP datagram remains unchanged as it travels from source to destination, with routers only modifying the TTL (Time-to-Live) field and recalculating the header checksum. This end-to-end principle ensures that the original data remains intact throughout the routing process.
