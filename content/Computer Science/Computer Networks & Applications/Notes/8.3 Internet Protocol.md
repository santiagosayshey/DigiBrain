> [!idea] Internet Protocol and Network Interfaces
>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses. 
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.
You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my mistake. Let me revise the explanation and examples to better reflect the role of routing tables on each device:

> [!idea] IP Datagram Routing: Source to Destination
>
> IP datagrams are routed based on the destination IP address in the header:
>
> 1. **Source Host**: Creates the datagram and checks its routing table to determine if the destination is local or remote.
>
> 2. **Direct Delivery**: If the destination is on the same network, sends the datagram directly to the destination host using its MAC address (obtained via ARP) at the data link layer.
>
> 3. **Router Forwarding**: If the destination is on a remote network, the source host sends the datagram to the next-hop router specified in its routing table for the destination network.
>
> 4. **Hop-by-Hop Routing**: Each router along the path consults its routing table to determine the next-hop router for the destination network until the datagram reaches the destination network.
>
> 5. **Final Router**: The last router, directly connected to the destination network, forwards the datagram to the destination host using its MAC address.
>
> 6. **Destination Host**: Receives the datagram, completing the journey.


> [!example] Forwarding Scenarios
>
> 1. **Local Delivery**: If host A (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to host B (192.168.1.20) on the same network, it will send the datagram directly to host B using B's MAC address.
>
> 2. **Remote Delivery**: If host A (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to host C (10.0.0.5) on a remote network, it will consult its routing table and send the datagram to the next-hop router (e.g., 192.168.1.1) specified for the destination network (10.0.0.0/8).
>
> 3. **Router to Router**: If router X (10.0.0.1) receives a datagram destined for a host on network 172.16.0.0/16, it will consult its routing table and forward the datagram to the next-hop router specified for that network.
