> [!idea] Internet Protocol and Network Interfaces
>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses.
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.

> [!idea] IPv4 Addressing
>
> IPv4 addresses use **dotted decimal notation**, where an address is represented by **4 sets of 8-bit sections, separated by dots**. The address is divided into two parts:
>
> - **Higher-order bits**: Represent the network part of the address
> - **Lower-order bits**: Represent the host part of the address
>
> For example:
>
> ```plaintext
> IP Address 1: 192.168.1.10
> IP Address 2: 192.168.1.20
>                ├───────┬──┤
>                Network Host
> ```
>
> Both devices have the same higher-order bits (`192.168.1`), indicating they are part of the same network. The lower-order bits (`10` and `20`) uniquely identify each device within the network.

> [!consider] Networks
> 
> Networks are:
>
> 1. A group of devices that can communicate directly without a router
> 2. Devices in the same network share the network part (higher-order bits) of their IP addresses
> 3. Devices in the same network that communicate using their IP addresses directly
>

> How do we determine **where the network part ends and the host part begins?** What information do we need to make this distinction?
