>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses.
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.

> [!idea] IPv4 Addressing
>
> IPv4 addresses use dotted decimal notation, where an address is represented by 4 sets of 8-bit sections, separated by dots.

> The IPv4 address is divided into two parts:
> 
> - **Higher-order bits**: These bits represent the network part of the address, identifying the specific network the device is connected to.
> - **Lower-order bits**: These bits represent the host part of the address, uniquely identifying the device within the network.
>
> The division between the network and host parts is determined by the subnet mask, which specifies the number of bits allocated for the network part.

> [!consider] Networks from the Perspective of IP Addresses
>
> From the perspective of IP addressing, a network consists of devices that can be reached without going through a router. These devices share the same network part in their IP addresses.
>
> - Devices within the same network can communicate directly with each other using their IP addresses.
> - To communicate with devices on a different network, data must be routed through a router or a series of routers.
>
> This concept of a network based on IP addressing is essential for understanding how data is transmitted between devices and how routers manage traffic between different networks.
