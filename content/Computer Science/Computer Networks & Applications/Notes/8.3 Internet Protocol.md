I appreciate your patience. Here's a corrected version:

> [!idea] Internet Protocol
>
> **Internet Protocol (IP) assigns unique addresses to devices, enabling them to send and receive data across networks.** These addresses ensure data packets are routed correctly from source to destination across various network paths.

> [!consider] IP Address Format
>
> Consider how IP addresses are formatted using dotted decimal notation, where an IP address is represented as four sets of numbers separated by dots, e.g., 192.168.1.1. Each set of numbers ranges from 0 to 255, representing a byte of the 32-bit total address. This format makes it easier to read and interpret the binary addresses used by computers.

> [!consider] Versions of Internet Protocol
>
> Reflect on the evolution of Internet Protocol versions, primarily IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4, with its 32-bit addressing, can accommodate over four billion unique addresses, but has reached its limit due to the growth of the internet. IPv6, introduced to tackle this limitation, uses 128-bit addresses, greatly expanding the number of possible addresses and improving routing efficiency and security.
