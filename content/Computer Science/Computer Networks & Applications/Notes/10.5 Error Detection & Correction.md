> [!motivation] The Need for Error Detection and Correction
> Errors can occur during data transmission or storage, **corrupting the data and leading to incorrect interpretations or system failures**. Error detection and correction techniques are essential to maintain data accuracy and reliability.

> [!idea] Error Detection and Correction (EDC)
> EDC ensures data integrity by adding redundant bits (EDC bits) to the original data. The two main types of EDC are:
>
> 1. **Error Detection**: Detects errors using parity checking. A parity bit is added to make the total number of 1s even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). If the received parity doesn't match, an error is detected.
>
> 2. **Error Correction**: Detects and corrects errors using error correction codes (ECC) like Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and CRC codes. ECC adds redundancy to identify and correct errors.

> [!example] Example 1: 1's Complement Error Detection
> 1. **Original Data**: Consider an 8-bit binary number `10110011`.
> 2. **1's Complement**: Flip all the bits to get the 1's complement: `01001100`.
> 3. **Transmission**: Transmit both the original data and its 1's complement.
> 4. **Error Detection**: Upon reception, add the original data and its 1's complement:
> 
>    ```
>      10110011
>    + 01001100
>    -----------
>      11111111
>    ```
> 5. **Verification**: If the result is `11111111`, no error is detected. Any deviation indicates an error.

> [!example] Example 2: 2's Complement Error Detection
> 1. **Original Data**: Consider an 8-bit binary number `10110011`.
> 2. **1's Complement**: Flip all the bits to get the 1's complement: `01001100`.
> 3. **2's Complement**: Add 1 to the 1's complement: `01001100 + 1 = 01001101`.
> 4. **Transmission**: Transmit both the original data and its 2's complement.
> 5. **Error Detection**: Upon reception, add the original data and its 2's complement:
> 
>    ```
>      10110011
>    + 01001101
>    -----------
>      00000000 (with overflow)
>    ```
> 6. **Verification**: If the result is `00000000` (with overflow), no error is detected. Any deviation indicates an error.
