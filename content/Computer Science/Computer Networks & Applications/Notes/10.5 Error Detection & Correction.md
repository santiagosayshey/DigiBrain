> [!motivation] The Need for Error Detection and Correction
> Errors can occur during data transmission or storage, **corrupting the data and leading to incorrect interpretations or system failures**. Error detection and correction techniques are essential to maintain data accuracy and reliability.

> [!idea] Error Detection and Correction (EDC)
> EDC ensures data integrity by adding redundant bits (EDC bits) to the original data. The two main types of EDC are:
>
> 1. **Error Detection**: Detects errors using parity checking. A parity bit is added to make the total number of 1s even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). If the received parity doesn't match, an error is detected.
>
> 2. **Error Correction**: Detects and corrects errors using error correction codes (ECC) like Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and CRC codes. ECC adds redundancy to identify and correct errors.

> [!example] Internet Checksum
> Internet checksum is an error detection technique used in Internet protocols like TCP and IP. It calculates a 16-bit checksum by dividing the data into 16-bit words and computing the one's complement of their sum. The checksum is appended to the data and verified by the receiver.

> Example:
>
> | Data | 16-bit Words | Sum (in Binary) | Checksum |
> |------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
> | 0110100001100001 | 0110100001100001 | 0110100001100001 | 1001011110011110 |
>
> If a bit is corrupted during transmission, the receiver's calculated checksum will differ from the received checksum, indicating an error.
>
> | Data | 16-bit Words | Sum (in Binary) | Calculated Checksum | Received Checksum | Error Detected |
> |------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
> | 0110100001110001 | 0110100001110001 | 0110100001110001 | 100101111000111**0** | 100101111001111**1** | Yes |
