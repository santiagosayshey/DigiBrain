> [!motivation] The Need for Error Detection and Correction
> Errors can occur during data transmission or storage, **corrupting the data and leading to incorrect interpretations or system failures**. Error detection and correction techniques are essential to maintain data accuracy and reliability.

> [!idea] Error Detection and Correction (EDC) Bits
> EDC bits are **additional bits added to the original data to facilitate error detection and correction**. The two main types of EDC bits are:
> 
> 1. **Parity Bits**: Added to make the total number of 1s in the data even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). If the parity doesn't match, an error is detected.
> 
> 2. **Error Correction Codes (ECC)**: More advanced than parity bits, ECC bits can detect and correct errors. Examples include Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) codes.

> [!example] Example: Parity Bit
> Original data: `1011010`
> 
> Even parity bit added: `0`
> 
> Transmitted data: `10110100`
> 
> If a single bit is flipped during transmission, e.g., `11110100`, the parity mismatch (odd instead of even) indicates an error.

> [!consider] Hamming Codes
> - Hamming codes can detect and correct single-bit errors.
> - Parity bits are added at positions that are powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).
> - Parity bits are calculated using XOR operation on specific subsets of data bits.
> - The receiver can identify the position of the error by examining the parity bits and flip the erroneous bit to correct it.
> - Widely used in computer memory (RAM) and digital communication systems.
