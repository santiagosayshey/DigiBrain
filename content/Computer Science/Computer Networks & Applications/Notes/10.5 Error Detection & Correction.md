> [!motivation] The Need for Error Detection and Correction
> Errors can occur during data transmission or storage, **corrupting the data and leading to incorrect interpretations or system failures**. Error detection and correction techniques are essential to maintain data accuracy and reliability.

> [!idea] Error Detection and Correction (EDC)
> EDC ensures data integrity by adding redundant bits (EDC bits) to the original data. The two main types of EDC are:
>
> 1. **Error Detection**: Detects errors using parity checking. A parity bit is added to make the total number of 1s even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). If the received parity doesn't match, an error is detected.
>
> 2. **Error Correction**: Detects and corrects errors using error correction codes (ECC) like Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and CRC codes. ECC adds redundancy to identify and correct errors.

> [!idea] Internet Checksum
> Internet Checksum is an error detection technique used in Internet protocols like TCP and IP. It ensures data integrity by:
> 
> 1. Dividing the data into 16-bit words
> 2. Calculating the two's complement sum of the words
> 3. Taking the one's complement of the sum to get the checksum
> 4. Appending the checksum to the data
> 
> When the receiver receives the data, it adds all the 16-bit words, including the appended checksum. If the result is all 1's (`FFFF`), it indicates that no errors occurred during transmission. If the result is not `FFFF`, it means an error has been detected.



> [!example] Example: Internet Checksum in Two's Complement
> 
> 1. **Packet in Hexadecimal**: Consider a packet represented in hexadecimal: `AB00 FFDE 03A3 9CF2`.
> 
> 2. **Checksum Field**: The checksum field is initially `0000` (not included in the calculation).
> 
> 3. **Form 16-bit Words**: Split the packet into 16-bit words:
> 
> ```
> AB00
> FFDE
> 03A3
> 9CF2
> ```
> 
> 4. **Two's Complement Sum**:
> 
>    - Convert each hex value to binary:
> 
> ```
> 1010101100000000
> 1111111111011110
> 0000001110100011
> 1001110011110010
> ```
> 
>    - Add these binary values, storing the sum in a 32-bit word:
> 
> ```
> 1010101100000000
> + 1111111111011110
> ---------------------
> 11010101011011110 (overflow, carry added to sum)
> + 0000001110100011
> ---------------------
> 1010101010000001
> + 1001110011110010
> ---------------------
> 0100011101110011
> 
> Sum in hexadecimal: 0002 4B73
> ```
> 
> 5. **One's Complement**:
> 
>    - Add the carry (`0002`) to the sum (`4B73`) and take the one's complement:
> 
> ```
> 0002 + 4B73 = 4B75
> 
> One's complement of 4B75: B48A
> 
> Checksum in hexadecimal: B48A
> ```
> 
> 6. **Checksum**:
> 
>    - The calculated checksum value `B48A` is then inserted into the checksum field of the packet.
> 
> 7. **Verification**:
> 
>    - Add the 16-bit words of the packet, including the calculated checksum:
> 
> ```
> AB00
> FFDE
> 03A3
> 9CF2
> B48A
> ```
> 
>    - Convert each hex value to binary and add them:
> 
> ```
> 1010101100000000
> 1111111111011110
> 0000001110100011
> 1001110011110010
> 1011010010001010
> ---------------------
> 1111111111111111
> 
> Sum in hexadecimal: FFFF
> ```
> 
>    - The sum of all 16-bit words, including the checksum, equals `FFFF`.
> 
>    - In the Internet Checksum algorithm, a sum of `FFFF` (all 1's) is equivalent to 0.
> 
>    - This result indicates that there were no errors during transmission.
