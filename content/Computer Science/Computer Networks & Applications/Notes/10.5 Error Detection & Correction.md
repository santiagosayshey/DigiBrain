> [!motivation] The Need for Error Detection and Correction
> Errors can occur during data transmission or storage, **corrupting the data and leading to incorrect interpretations or system failures**. Error detection and correction techniques are essential to maintain data accuracy and reliability.

> [!idea] Error Detection and Correction (EDC)
> EDC ensures data integrity by adding redundant bits (EDC bits) to the original data. The two main types of EDC are:
>
> 1. **Error Detection**: Detects errors using parity checking. A parity bit is added to make the total number of 1s even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). If the received parity doesn't match, an error is detected.
>
> 2. **Error Correction**: Detects and corrects errors using error correction codes (ECC) like Hamming codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and CRC codes. ECC adds redundancy to identify and correct errors.
