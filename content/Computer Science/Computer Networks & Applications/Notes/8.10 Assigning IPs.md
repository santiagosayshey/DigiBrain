> [!idea] Assigning IPs to Hosts
>
> When a **device connects** to a network, it requires a **unique IP address** to communicate. This assignment is done through:
>
> - **Static IP Assignment**: Admins manually hardcode addresses in a file. 
>
> - **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Servers automatically assign addresses upon connection.
>
> - **Link-local Addressing (IPv6)**: In IPv6, hosts generate addresses without DHCP, using MAC addresses or randomization for communication within a network segment.
>
> These methods provide unique identifiers for seamless communication within and across networks.

> [!idea] Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
>
> DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices that connect to a network. Here's how DHCP works:
>
> 1. **Request**: When a device, such as a computer or smartphone, joins a network, it sends a DHCP request broadcast message to discover DHCP servers available on the network.
>
> 2. **Offer**: DHCP servers on the network respond with DHCP offer messages containing IP address lease information, such as the IP address being offered, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses, and lease duration.
>
> 3. **Selection**: The device selects one of the DHCP offers and sends a DHCP request message to the chosen DHCP server, confirming its request for the offered IP address and network configuration settings.
>
> 4. **Acknowledgment**: Upon receiving the DHCP request message, the DHCP server sends a DHCP acknowledgment message, finalizing the IP address lease and providing the device with the requested network configuration settings.

> | Step | Client (192.168.1.100) | DHCP Server (192.168.1.1) | Description |
> |------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
> | 1.   | **DHCP Discover**<br>Source IP: 0.0.0.0<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Client MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF | Receives Discover | The client broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to locate available DHCP servers. |
> | 2.   | Receives Offer | **DHCP Offer**<br>Source IP: 192.168.1.1<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Offered IP: 192.168.1.10<br>Lease Time: 86400 seconds | The server responds with a DHCP Offer message, proposing an IP address and lease terms. |
> | 3.   | **DHCP Request**<br>Source IP: 0.0.0.0<br>Destination IP: 255.255.255.255<br>Client MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF<br>Requested IP: 192.168.1.10 | Receives Request | The client sends a DHCP Request message to accept the offered IP address and confirm the lease. |
> | 4.   | Receives Acknowledgment | **DHCP Acknowledgment**<br>Source IP: 192.168.1.1<br>Destination IP: 192.168.1.100<br>Leased IP: 192.168.1.10<br>Lease Time: 86400 seconds | The server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment message, finalizing the IP address lease and configuration details to the client. |

> [!idea] Assigning IPs to Networks
>
> Networks receive IP addresses through a hierarchical system of distribution:
>
> | Level | Entity | Function | Example |
> |-------|--------|----------|---------|
> | 1 | **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)** | Distribute large blocks of IP addresses based on geographic regions. | Allocates a block of IP addresses to ISPs in North America, Europe, Asia, etc. |
> | 2 | **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** | Receive IP address blocks from RIRs and allocate them to customers. | Assigns individual or blocks of IP addresses to residential and business customers. |
> | 3 | **End Users/Organizations** | Receive IP addresses or blocks from ISPs. Utilize subnetting for large blocks. | Uses a single IP for home internet access or subnets a block for different departments. |

> [!example] Example of IP Address Allocation
>
> This example outlines how a specific block of IP addresses is distributed from an RIR to an ISP, and then to its customers:
>
> | Level | Entity | IP Address Allocation | Example Detail |
> |-------|--------|-----------------------|----------------|
> | 1 | **RIR (e.g., ARIN)** | 20-bit block (e.g., 192.168.0.0/12) | Allocates a 20-bit block to ISP A. |
> | 2 | **ISP A** | Subdivides 20-bit block into smaller blocks | Divides the 20-bit block into several 24-bit blocks (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24) for distribution to various customers. |
> | 3 | **Small Business Customer** | Receives a 24-bit block (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) | Uses the block for their network, potentially further subdividing it for different departments. |
> | 4 | **Residential Customer** | Receives a single IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100) | Uses this IP for home internet access. |

> [!consider] Simplifying Routing Tables through IP Address Assignment
>
> Assigning IP addresses systematically can greatly simplify routing tables:
>
> - **Route Aggregation**: Assigning contiguous IP blocks allows routers to use fewer entries by summarizing multiple routes into one.
> - **Example**: If an IP address starts with `192.168`, indicating North America, and further specifics such as `192.168.1` allocated to ISP A, and `192.168.1.100` to a specific business, routers can efficiently direct traffic based on these prefixes without extensive lookup in the routing table.
