> [!idea] Parity Bits
> Parity Bits are an error detection technique that **ensures the total number of 1's in the transmitted data, including the parity bit, is either odd OR even.**
> 
> - For an odd parity bit:
> 	1. Count the number of 1's in the original data bits.
> 	2. If the count is odd, set the parity bit to 0 
> 	3. If the count is even, set the parity bit to 1
> 	4. Append the parity bit to the original data bits.
> 	5. If it were an even parity bit, they would swap

> [!example] Example: Odd Parity
> 
> 1. **Original Data**: Consider an 8-bit data word: `10101001`.
> 
> 2. **Count 1's**: The number of 1's in the original data is 4 (even).
> 
> 3. **Set Parity Bit**: Since the count is even, the parity bit is set to 1 to make the total number of 1's odd.
> 
> 4. **Append Parity Bit**: The parity bit is appended to the original data: `101010011`.
> 
> 5. **Transmission**: The 9-bit data (including the parity bit) is transmitted.
> 
> 6. **Reception**: The receiver receives the 9-bit data: `101010011`.
> 
> 7. **Error Check**:
>    - The receiver counts the number of 1's in the received data (including the parity bit).
>    - If the count is odd (5 in this case), no error is detected.
>    - If the count is even, an error is detected, indicating that the data was corrupted during transmission.
> 
> In this example, the odd parity scheme successfully detects single-bit errors, ensuring data integrity during transmission.

> [!consider] Issues with One-Dimensional Parity
> One-dimensional parity, while simple and effective for detecting single-bit errors, has significant limitations:
> 
> - **Multiple Errors**: It cannot detect errors if an even number of bits are flipped. For example, if two bits are flipped, the parity bit will still match the expected value, leading to undetected errors.
> - **Burst Errors**: In practical scenarios, errors often occur in bursts (several bits in a sequence), which one-dimensional parity fails to detect.
> - **Correction Limitation**: It only detects errors but cannot correct them. Once an error is detected, there's no information about which bit is erroneous.
> - **Overhead**: Adding a single parity bit increases the data transmission size by a minimal amount, but this small overhead does not compensate for its limited error detection capability in complex data transmissions.

> [!idea] Two-Dimensional Parity
> Two-dimensional parity improves error detection by arranging data in a grid and adding parity bits for each row and column. This technique provides a higher probability of detecting multiple errors.
> 
> - **Structure**:
>   1. Organize the data into a two-dimensional array.
>   2. Calculate parity bits for each row.
>   3. Calculate parity bits for each column.
>   4. Append the row and column parity bits to the array.
> - **Error Detection**: If any bit is altered, the corresponding row and column parity bits will indicate the presence of an error.
> - **Error Correction**: By identifying the specific row and column with errors, it is possible to pinpoint and correct a single erroneous bit.


> [!example] Example: Two-Dimensional Parity with Even Parity
> 1. **Original Data**: Consider a 4x4 block of data:
> 
>    ```
>    1101
>    1010
>    1111
>    1001
>    ```
> 2. **Calculate Row Parity (Even Parity)**:
> 
>    ```
>    1101 | 1
>    1010 | 0
>    1111 | 0
>    1001 | 0
>    ```
> 3. **Calculate Column Parity (Even Parity)**:
> 
>    ```
>    1101 | 1
>    1010 | 0
>    1111 | 0
>    1001 | 0
>    -----
>    0001 | 1
>    ```
> 4. **Append Parity Bits**:
> 
>    ```
>    1101 1
>    1010 0
>    1111 0
>    1001 0
>    0001 1
>    ```
> 5. **Transmission**: Transmit the 5x5 array (original data + row and column parity bits).
> 6. **Error Detection**:
>    - Suppose an error occurs, flipping a bit in the second row and third column:
> 
>    ```
>    1101 1
>    1000 0
>    1111 0
>    1001 0
>    0001 1
>    ```
>    - The receiver recalculates the parity bits:
> 
>    ```
>    1101 1
>    1000 1 (error detected in this row)
>    1111 0
>    1001 0
>    0001 0 (error detected in this column)
>    ```
> 7. **Error Correction**:
>    - The intersection of the erroneous row and column indicates the location of the error.
>    - Flip the bit back to correct the error:
> 
>    ```
>    1101 1
>    1010 0
>    1111 0
>    1001 0
>    0001 1
