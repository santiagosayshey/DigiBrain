> [!consider]+ What Happens When a Network Router Is Overwhelmed by Data?
> Imagine a scenario where a client sends data at a rate that exceeds the processing capacity of a network router. This overload can lead to significant network issues: the **router's buffer may fill up**, resulting in **dropped packets**, and as the queue lengthens, it causes **delays to increase**. 
> 
> This is **congestion**: **a state where the network resources are pushed beyond their limits**, disrupting the smooth flow of data.

> [!consider]+ Reasons to Avoid Network Congestion
> Network congestion not only slows down data transmission but also has broader implications for network performance:
> - **Limited Throughput**: Throughput is capped at **routers**. Sending data at rates higher than what the router can handle doesn't increase throughput; instead, it causes a bottleneck.
> - **Increased Delay**: Congestion significantly increases the average **delay**. As more packets are queued, the time taken for a packet to move through the network increases.
> - **Wasted Resources**: Retransmission of packets—whether dropped or delayed—adds unnecessary overhead to the network. If a packet is dropped, all the effort and resources used to transmit it thus far, including the efforts of earlier routers, are wasted.
> - **Degraded Performance**: As the level of congestion approaches the network's capacity, performance degrades exponentially. Avoiding congestion is essential to maintain the efficiency and reliability of network communication.

> [!idea]+ Approaches to Avoiding Congestion
> There are two primary strategies for tackling network congestion:
> 
> 1. **Network Layer Assisted**:
>    - Routers actively monitor traffic and provide explicit feedback on congestion levels and available data rates.
>    - Mechanisms like Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), as proposed in RFC 3168, allow routers to flag packets to indicate congestion without dropping them.
> 
> 2. **End-Systems**:
>    - End systems, such as computers and servers, deduce congestion indirectly through packet acknowledgments and round-trip times.
>    - TCP/IP implementations often adjust their sending rate based on these cues, increasing the rate cautiously to avoid causing congestion.
> 
> **Which is better?** While network-assisted approaches can increase the complexity of router design, they provide accurate congestion signals. Conversely, end-system strategies rely on inferences that can be incorrect, especially in networks with variable conditions like mobile networks. Both methods play a role in modern networks, often complementing each other to provide robust congestion management.


> [!idea]+ TCP Congestion Control: Tahoe Algorithm
> TCP employs algorithms like Tahoe to manage congestion control by adjusting the size of the congestion window (`CongWin`) via `mss` - Maximum Segment Size 
> 
> ```
> Initialize CongWin = 1 MSS
> Initialize ssthresh = 65535 bytes
> 
> // Slow Start Phase
> While CongWin < ssthresh:
>   On ACK received:
>     CongWin = CongWin + MSS
>   On timeout:
>     ssthresh = CongWin / 2
>     CongWin = 1 MSS
> 
> // Congestion Avoidance Phase
> While CongWin >= ssthresh:
>   On ACK received:
>     CongWin = CongWin + (MSS * MSS) / CongWin
>   On timeout:
>     ssthresh = CongWin / 2
>     CongWin = 1 MSS
> ```
> 
> This routine controls the sending rate based on network feedback. During the **Slow Start** phase, `CongWin` grows rapidly with each acknowledgment received. If a timeout occurs, indicating possible congestion, the `ssthresh` is lowered, and `CongWin` is reset to 1 MSS. Once the `CongWin` exceeds `ssthresh`, the algorithm enters the **Congestion Avoidance** phase, where `CongWin` grows more gradually. This helps to probe for the available capacity while trying to avoid inducing further congestion.![[Congestion Control.png|500]]

> [!idea]+ TCP Congestion Control Extensions: Reno and Vegas
> TCP Reno and Vegas represent enhancements over the original Tahoe algorithm, addressing how TCP handles congestion.
> 
> **Reno - 1990:**
> - **Fast Retransmit**: Reno improves on Tahoe by implementing fast retransmit, which triggers when three duplicate ACKs are received, indicating a packet has likely been lost. Instead of waiting for a timeout, Reno retransmits the packet immediately.
> - **Fast Recovery**: After fast retransmit, Reno enters fast recovery, wherein it doesn't start with slow start again. It halves the congestion window and then continues with congestion avoidance, thereby avoiding the lower throughput of starting from scratch.
> 
> **Vegas - 1995:**
> - Vegas takes a more proactive approach by attempting to detect congestion before packet losses occur. It measures the difference between expected and actual throughput to infer the beginning stages of congestion and adjusts its sending rate accordingly, allowing it to maintain a more consistent throughput. 
> 
> Both Reno and Vegas aim to keep the network operating efficiently by reacting to congestion signals promptly. Reno does this reactively upon indications of packet loss, while Vegas does so preemptively by assessing variations in throughput.
