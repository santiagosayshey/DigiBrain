> [!idea]+ TCP Flow Control
> TCP flow control is a mechanism that ensures data is transferred between sender and receiver at a pace that both can handle efficiently. It exists to **prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver's buffer** by sending data faster than it can be processed. 
> 
> Flow control is managed using the **window size** TCP header, **indicating how much more data the receiver can accept**. The sender can send more data as long as the window size is greater than zero.
