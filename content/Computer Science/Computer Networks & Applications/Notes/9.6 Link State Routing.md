> [!idea] Dijkstra's Algorithm in Link-State Routing
> [[9.2 Dijkstra's Algorithm|Dijkstra's algorithm]] is used in link-state routing protocols to **calculate the shortest paths between nodes** in a network. Each router independently runs the algorithm on its local link-state database to **build a routing table rooted at itself**.
>
> The algorithm uses the following notation:
> - `N`: Set of nodes in the network
> - `E`: Set of edges (links) in the network
> - `c(i, j)`: Cost of the link between nodes `i` and `j`
> - `D(v)`: Cost of the shortest path from the source node to node `v`
> - `p(v)`: Predecessor of node `v` in the shortest path
>
> The algorithm maintains two sets:
> - `S`: Set of visited nodes for which the shortest path has been determined
> - `Q`: Set of unvisited nodes
>
> The general steps of Dijkstra's algorithm in link-state routing are:
> 1. Initialize `D(v) = ∞` for all nodes except the source node, which has `D(source) = 0`.
> 2. Initialize `S = ∅` and `Q = N`.
> 3. While `Q ≠ ∅`, select the node `u` in `Q` with the minimum `D(u)` and move it to `S`.
> 4. For each neighbor `v` of `u` in `Q`, update `D(v) = min(D(v), D(u) + c(u, v))` and set `p(v) = u` if a shorter path is found.
> 5. Repeat steps 3-4 until `Q` is empty.

> Consider the following network topology:

> [Image Description]: A network graph with 5 nodes (A, B, C, D, E) and the following link costs:
> - A to B: 2
> - A to C: 4
> - B to C: 1
> - B to D: 4
> - B to E: 3
> - C to D: 2
> - D to E: 1

> To find the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes, Dijkstra's algorithm proceeds as follows:

> 1. Initialize:
>    - `D(A) = 0`, `D(B) = D(C) = D(D) = D(E) = D(F) = ∞`
>    - `S = ∅`, `Q = {A, B, C, D, E, F}`
>
> 2. Select node A (minimum `D(A) = 0`), move it to `S`, and update neighbors:
>    - `D(B) = min(∞, 0 + 2) = 2`, `p(B) = A`
>    - `D(C) = min(∞, 0 + 1) = 1`, `p(C) = A`
>
> 3. Select node D (minimum `D(D) = 1`), move it to `S`, and update neighbors:
>    - `D(C) = min(4, 2 + 1) = 3`, `p(C) = B`
>    - `D(D) = min(∞, 2 + 4) = 6`, `p(D) = B`
>    - `D(E) = min(∞, 2 + 3) = 5`, `p(E) = B`
>
> 4. Select node C (minimum `D(C) = 3`), move it to `S`, and update neighbors:
>    - `D(D) = min(6, 3 + 2) = 5`, `p(D) = C`
>
> 5. Select node D (minimum `D(D) = 5`), move it to `S`, and update neighbors:
>    - `D(E) = min(5, 5 + 1) = 5`, `p(E)` remains unchanged
>
> 6. Select node E (minimum `D(E) = 5`), move it to `S`.

> The algorithm terminates with the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes:
> - A to B: A → B (cost: 2)
> - A to C: A → B → C (cost: 3)
> - A to D: A → B → C → D (cost: 5)
> - A to E: A → B → E (cost: 5)
