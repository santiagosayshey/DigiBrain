> [!idea] Dijkstra's Algorithm in Link-State Routing
> [[9.2 Dijkstra's Algorithm|Dijkstra's algorithm]] is used in link-state routing protocols to **calculate the shortest paths between nodes** in a network. Each router independently runs the algorithm on its local link-state database to **build a routing table rooted at itself**.
>
> The algorithm uses the following notation:
> - `N`: Set of nodes in the network
> - `E`: Set of edges (links) in the network
> - `c(i, j)`: Cost of the link between nodes `i` and `j`
> - `D(v)`: Cost of the shortest path from the source node to node `v`
> - `p(v)`: Predecessor of node `v` in the shortest path
>
> The algorithm maintains two sets:
> - `S`: Set of visited nodes for which the shortest path has been determined
> - `Q`: Set of unvisited nodes
>
> The general steps of Dijkstra's algorithm in link-state routing are:
> 1. Initialize `D(v) = ∞` for all nodes except the source node, which has `D(source) = 0`.
> 2. Initialize `S = ∅` and `Q = N`.
> 3. While `Q ≠ ∅`, select the node `u` in `Q` with the minimum `D(u)` and move it to `S`.
> 4. For each neighbor `v` of `u` in `Q`, update `D(v) = min(D(v), D(u) + c(u, v))` and set `p(v) = u` if a shorter path is found.
> 5. Repeat steps 3-4 until `Q` is empty.

> In each step, the node with the smallest known distance from the source node A is selected and marked as visited. The distances and predecessors of its neighbors are updated if a shorter path is found.
