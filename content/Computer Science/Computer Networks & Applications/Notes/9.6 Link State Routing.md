> [!idea] Dijkstra's Algorithm in Link-State Routing
> [[9.2 Dijkstra's Algorithm|Dijkstra's algorithm]] is used in link-state routing protocols to **calculate the shortest paths between nodes** in a network. Each router independently runs the algorithm on its local link-state database to **build a routing table rooted at itself**.
>
> The algorithm uses the following notation:
> - `N`: Set of nodes in the network
> - `E`: Set of edges (links) in the network
> - `c(i, j)`: Cost of the link between nodes `i` and `j`
> - `D(v)`: Cost of the shortest path from the source node to node `v`
> - `p(v)`: Predecessor of node `v` in the shortest path
>
> The algorithm maintains two sets:
> - `S`: Set of visited nodes for which the shortest path has been determined
> - `Q`: Set of unvisited nodes
>
> The general steps of Dijkstra's algorithm in link-state routing are:
> 1. Initialize `D(v) = ∞` for all nodes except the source node, which has `D(source) = 0`.
> 2. Initialize `S = ∅` and `Q = N`.
> 3. While `Q ≠ ∅`, select the node `u` in `Q` with the minimum `D(u)` and move it to `S`.
> 4. For each neighbor `v` of `u` in `Q`, update `D(v) = min(D(v), D(u) + c(u, v))` and set `p(v) = u` if a shorter path is found.
> 5. Repeat steps 3-4 until `Q` is empty.

> [!example] Example: Shortest Path Computation
> Consider the following network topology. Green nodes are univisted, yellow nodes are visited. Blue edges have been added to the queue, yellow edges are at the top of the priority queue (smallest), and white edges have not been accounted for yet.

> The algorithm terminates with the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes:

> - A to C: A → B → C (cost: 3)

> - A to E: A → B → E (cost: 5)
