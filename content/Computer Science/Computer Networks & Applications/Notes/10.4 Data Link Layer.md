> [!motivation] Motivation
> Once the network layer determines the path for packets, the data link layer is **responsible for actually transmitting the data over the physical medium**. However, sending raw bits directly is prone to errors due to noise and interference.
> 
> The data link layer **acts as a "delivery truck" that carries packets from one node to the next**. It ensures that packets are not corrupted during transmission and can detect and possibly correct errors.

> [!idea] Data Link Layer
> The data link layer has two key responsibilities:
> 1. **Encapsulating data into frames**, which contain:
>    - Header: Source and destination MAC addresses, IP addresses, frame type, and control information.
>    - Payload: The actual data being transmitted, usually a packet from the network layer.
>    - Trailer: Error detection and correction information, such as a frame check sequence (FCS).
> 2. **Providing link access**: Controlling access to the physical medium using MAC protocols like CSMA/CD (Ethernet) or CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi).
> 3. **Providing reliable transport**: Ensuring data is delivered accurately between adjacent nodes through error detection, error correction, and flow control.

> [!idea] MAC Addresses
> Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interface cards (NICs) and are used by the data link layer for local delivery of frames within a single network segment. Key points include:
> - **48-bit address**: MAC addresses are 48 bits long and represented in hexadecimal notation.
> - **Uniqueness**: MAC addresses are globally unique.
> - **Local scope**: MAC addresses are used for communication within a single network segment. They change at each hop, while IP addresses remain constant.
> - **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses within a LAN.
> 
> MAC addressing is crucial for reliable and efficient communication between devices on a local network.

> [!example] Sending a Packet Between Two LANs
> Consider sending a packet from 192.168.1.10 in LAN A to 192.168.2.20 in LAN B through a router:
> 1. 192.168.1.10 encapsulates the packet in a frame with the router's MAC address on LAN A as the destination and its own as the source. IP addresses remain constant.
> 2. The frame is sent over LAN A to the router.
> 3. The router de-encapsulates the frame and looks up the next hop for 192.168.2.20.
> 4. The router encapsulates the packet in a new frame with the next hop's MAC address on LAN B as the destination and its own as the source. IP addresses remain unchanged.
> 5. The new frame is sent over LAN B, and the process continues until it reaches 192.168.2.20.
> 
> This shows how **IP addresses remain constant, while MAC addresses change based on the network segment**.

> [!consider] Data Link Layer Implementation
> The data link layer is implemented using both software and hardware:
> - **Software**: The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, responsible for error control and flow control, is typically implemented in software.
> - **Hardware**: The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer, handling framing, physical addressing, and access control, is often implemented in hardware using a Network Interface Card (NIC).
>   - **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: A hardware component that connects a device to the network, includes a unique MAC address, and sends/receives frames over the physical medium.
>   - **Integrated NICs**: Modern systems often have NICs integrated directly into the motherboard for simplicity and cost reduction.
