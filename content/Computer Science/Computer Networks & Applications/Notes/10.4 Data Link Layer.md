> [!motivation] Motivation
> Once the network layer determines the path for packets, the data link layer is **responsible for actually transmitting the data over the physical medium**. However, sending raw bits directly is prone to errors due to noise and interference.
> 
> The data link layer **acts as a "delivery truck" that carries packets from one node to the next**. It ensures that packets are not corrupted during transmission and can detect and possibly correct errors.

> [!idea] Data Link Layer
> The data link layer has two key responsibilities:
> 1. **Encapsulating data into frames**, which contain:
>    - Header: Source and destination MAC addresses, IP addresses, frame type, and control information.
>    - Payload: The actual data being transmitted, usually a packet from the network layer.
>    - Trailer: Error detection and correction information, such as a frame check sequence (FCS).
> 2. **Providing link access**: Controlling access to the physical medium using MAC protocols like CSMA/CD (Ethernet) or CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi).
> 3. **Providing reliable transport**: Ensuring data is delivered accurately between adjacent nodes through error detection, error correction, and flow control.

> [!consider] Why the Data Link Layer Provides Reliable Delivery
> Although TCP provides end-to-end reliability, the data link layer offers hop-by-hop reliability between adjacent nodes. This is important because:
> - It helps detect and correct errors early, preventing error propagation.
> - It **contains errors within a single network segment, preventing wasted bandwidth** and processing power.
> - Local retransmission is faster than end-to-end retransmission by TCP.
> - It adapts error control mechanisms to the specific needs of each link.

> [!motivation] Need for Local Data Sharing
>
> Within organizations and localized environments, there was a growing **need to efficiently share data, resources, and enable communication among computers and devices in close proximity**. Traditional methods of data transfer were cumbersome and inefficient, prompting the development of Local Area Networks (LANs).

> [!idea] Local Area Network (LAN)
>
> A LAN is a **computer network that interconnects devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office** or campus. LANs facilitate high-speed data communication, resource sharing, and collaborative work among users and systems within the local environment.

> [!idea] MAC Addresses
> Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interface cards (NICs) and are used by the data link layer for local delivery of frames within a single network segment. Key points include:
> - **48-bit address**: MAC addresses are 48 bits long and represented in hexadecimal notation.
> - **Uniqueness**: MAC addresses are globally unique.
> - **Local scope**: MAC addresses are used for communication within a single network segment. They change at each hop, while IP addresses remain constant.
> - **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses within a LAN.
> 
> MAC addressing is crucial for reliable and efficient communication between devices on a local network.

> [!consider] MAC Address Allocation
>
> MAC addresses are **uniquely allocated to network interfaces to ensure global uniqueness across all devices and manufacturers.** This allocation process follows a hierarchical approach:
>
> - The IEEE assigns a unique Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) range to each manufacturer
> - The manufacturer then assigns a unique identifier from their allocated OUI range to each network interface they produce
>
> This two-step process is analogous to how tax file numbers are allocated:
>
> - A governing authority assigns a unique numbering range to each employer/entity
> - The employer then assigns a unique number from that range to each individual
>
> Just as a **tax file number uniquely identifies an individual, a MAC address uniquely identifies a network interface, even if it connects to different networks**. A single device can have multiple network interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, cellular), each with its own unique MAC address.
>
> By following this hierarchical allocation method, with the IEEE managing the OUI assignments and manufacturers managing the unique identifiers, MAC addresses maintain global uniqueness across all devices and manufacturers, enabling accurate data frame delivery on networks.

> [!example] Sending a Packet Between Two LANs
> Consider sending a packet from 192.168.1.10 in LAN A to 192.168.2.20 in LAN B through a router:
> 1. 192.168.1.10 encapsulates the packet in a frame with the router's MAC address on LAN A as the destination and its own as the source. IP addresses remain constant.
> 2. The frame is sent over LAN A to the router.
> 3. The router de-encapsulates the frame and looks up the next hop for 192.168.2.20.
> 4. The router encapsulates the packet in a new frame with the next hop's MAC address on LAN B as the destination and its own as the source. IP addresses remain unchanged.
> 5. The new frame is sent over LAN B, and the process continues until it reaches 192.168.2.20.
> 
> This shows how **IP addresses remain constant, while MAC addresses change based on the network segment**.

> [!consider] Data Link Layer Implementation
> The data link layer is implemented using both software and hardware:
> - **Software**: The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, responsible for error control and flow control, is typically implemented in software.
> - **Hardware**: The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer, handling framing, physical addressing, and access control, is often implemented in hardware using a Network Interface Card (NIC).
>   - **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: A hardware component that connects a device to the network, includes a unique MAC address, and sends/receives frames over the physical medium.
>   - **Integrated NICs**: Modern systems often have NICs integrated directly into the motherboard for simplicity and cost reduction.
