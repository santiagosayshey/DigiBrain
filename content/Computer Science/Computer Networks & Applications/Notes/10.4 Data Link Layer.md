> [!motivation] Motivation
> Once the network layer determines the path for packets, the **data link layer is responsible for actually transmitting the data** over the physical medium. However, sending raw bits directly is prone to errors due to noise and interference.
> 
> The data link layer **enables reliable data transfer between directly connected nodes**, acting as a "delivery truck" that carries packets from one node to the next. It ensures that packets are not corrupted during transmission and can detect and possibly correct errors.

> [!idea] Data Link Layer
> The data link layer has two key responsibilities:
> 1. **Reliable delivery between adjacent nodes**: Ensures data is accurately delivered from one node to the next **over the physical link** through:
>    - Framing
>    - Error detection and correction
>    - Flow control
> 2. **Access control for shared media**: Coordinates access to shared physical media (e.g., in a LAN) to avoid collisions using media access control (MAC) protocols.
