> [!motivation] Motivation
> Once the network layer determines the path for packets, the **data link layer is responsible for actually transmitting the data** over the physical medium. However, sending raw bits directly is prone to errors due to noise and interference.
> 
> The data link layer **enables reliable data transfer between directly connected nodes**, acting as a "delivery truck" that carries packets from one node to the next. It ensures that packets are not corrupted during transmission and can detect and possibly correct errors.

> [!idea] Data Link Layer
> The data link layer has two key responsibilities:
> 1. **Reliable delivery between adjacent nodes**: Ensures data is accurately delivered from one node to the next **over the physical link** through:
>    - Framing
>    - Error detection and correction
>    - Flow control
> 2. **Access control for shared media**: Coordinates access to shared physical media (e.g., in a LAN) to avoid collisions using media access control (MAC) protocols.

> [!example] Example: Ethernet Frame Structure
> Ethernet is a widely used data link layer protocol. An Ethernet frame consists of the following fields:
> ```
> [Preamble] [Dest. Address] [Source Address] [Type/Length] [Data] [Frame Check Sequence]
>     7B           6B               6B              2B       46-1500B         4B
> ```
> - **Preamble**: Synchronizes the receiver's clock with the sender's.
> - **Destination Address**: The MAC address of the intended recipient.
> - **Source Address**: The MAC address of the sender.
> - **Type/Length**: Indicates the type of data carried in the frame or the length of the data field.
> - **Data**: The actual payload, typically an IP packet from the network layer.
> - **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**: A 32-bit CRC used for error detection.
> 
> This structure allows Ethernet to encapsulate data, address frames to specific devices, and detect transmission errors.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations
> - **Sublayers**: The data link layer is often divided into two sublayers:
>   - Logical Link Control (LLC): Provides an interface for the network layer and performs flow and error control.
>   - Media Access Control (MAC): Handles framing and access control for the specific physical medium.
> - **Addressing**: Data link layer addresses (e.g., MAC addresses) are used for local delivery between devices on the same network segment. These addresses are unique to each network interface and are assigned by the manufacturer.
> - **Switching**: Data link layer switches (e.g., Ethernet switches) can be used to connect multiple devices within a network segment. Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices and forward frames only to the intended recipient, improving network efficiency and security.
