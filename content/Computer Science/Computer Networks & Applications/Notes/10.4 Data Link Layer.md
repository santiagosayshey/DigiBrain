> [!motivation] Motivation
> Once the network layer determines the path for packets, the **data link layer is responsible for actually transmitting the data** over the physical medium. However, sending raw bits directly is prone to errors due to noise and interference.
> 
> The data link layer **enables reliable data transfer between directly connected nodes**, acting as a "delivery truck" that carries packets from one node to the next. It ensures that packets are not corrupted during transmission and can detect and possibly correct errors.

> [!idea] Data Link Layer
> The data link layer has two key responsibilities:
> 1. **Reliable delivery between adjacent nodes**: Ensures data is accurately delivered from one node to the next **over the physical link** through:
>    - Framing
>    - Error detection and correction
>    - Flow control
> 2. **Access control for shared media**: Coordinates access to shared physical media (e.g., in a LAN) to avoid collisions using media access control (MAC) protocols.

> [!idea] Frames
> At the data link layer, **data is divided into manageable units called frames**. A frame is a structured sequence of bits that includes both the **data being transmitted and additional information for reliable delivery**. The general structure of a frame consists of:
> - **Header**: Contains information such as the source and destination addresses, frame type, and control information.
> - **Payload**: The actual data being transmitted, typically a packet from the network layer.
> - **Trailer**: Includes error detection and correction information, such as a frame check sequence (FCS) for detecting transmission errors.
> 
> The specific format of a frame can vary depending on the data link layer protocol being used (e.g., Ethernet, PPP, HDLC). However, the general purpose of framing remains the same: to provide a structured and reliable means of transmitting data over a physical link.
