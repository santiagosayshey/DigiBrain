> [!idea] Distance Vector Routing: A Distributed Approach to Finding Shortest Paths
> 
> Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is a distributed routing algorithm where each node independently determines the shortest path to every other node.
> - Each node maintains a routing table
> - Each entry in the table has a `cost` and a `via`
> - Each node sends its routing table to its neighbours
> - Each node updates its own table based on the tables sent to it by other nodes

> [!example] Illustrating Distance Vector Routing in Action
>
> Let's consider a simple network with five nodes: A, B, C, D and E. Let's figure out the routing table at E!
>
>![[DVR Example.png|500]]
>
> Initially, E only knows the distances to its directly connected neighbours. Then, each neighbouring node shares its routing table with E, and E can update it's routing table using each respective node as an intermediate. Assume that every other routing table has been finalised. We can see that there are many times where the loop routes back through E itself!

> [!consider] Count-to-Infinity Problem: Incrementing Routes and Convergence
>
> In Distance Vector Routing, the count-to-infinity problem arises when a link or node fails, and the network infinitely tries to update the links to this node in the other nodes. 
>
> Let's consider a simple network topology: A -- B -- C, where the link between B and C fails. Initially, A's routing table indicates that it can reach C via B with a distance of 2. After the link failure, B updates its distance to C as infinity and sends this update to A. 
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20240513231348.png]]
> 
> However, A still believes it can reach C via B, so it increments the distance received from B by 1 and updates its own distance to C as 3. In the next routing update, A sends this distance of 3 to B, and B updates its distance to C as 4 (A's distance plus 1). This process continues, with the distance incrementing by 1 at each update, until it reaches infinity.

> [!idea] Poison Reverse: A Cautionary Mechanism
>
> Despite its limitations, Poison Reverse is still a useful technique in Distance Vector Routing. It acts as a cautionary mechanism to prevent the propagation of potentially incorrect or outdated information.
>
> By marking routes as infinity when sending updates back to the source, Poison Reverse helps to:
>
> 1. Break routing loops that could occur due to inconsistent or outdated information.
>
> 2. Encourage nodes to seek alternative paths more quickly when a route becomes unavailable.
>
> 3. Prevent nodes from continuously using and advertising routes that might no longer be valid.
>
> While it may occasionally mark valid routes as infinity, Poison Reverse serves as a safeguard against the count-to-infinity problem and helps improve the overall stability and convergence of the network.
>
> In practice, Poison Reverse is often used in combination with other techniques, such as triggered updates and hold-down timers, to mitigate its limitations and provide a more robust and efficient routing mechanism.
