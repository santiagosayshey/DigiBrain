> Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is a distributed routing algorithm where each node independently determines the shortest path to every other node.

> - Each entry in the table has a `cost` and a `via`
> - Each node sends its routing table to its neighbours

> Initially, E only knows the distances to its directly connected neighbours. Then, each neighbouring node shares its routing table with E, and E can update it's routing table using each respective node as an intermediate. Assume that every other routing table has been finalised. We can see that there are many times where the loop routes back through E itself!

> [!consider] Count-to-Infinity Problem: Incrementing Routes and Convergence
>
> In Distance Vector Routing, the count-to-infinity problem arises when a link or node fails, and the network infinitely tries to update the links to this node in the other nodes. 
>
> Let's consider a simple network topology: A -- B -- C, where the link between B and C fails. Initially, A's routing table indicates that it can reach C via B with a distance of 2. After the link failure, B updates its distance to C as infinity and sends this update to A. 
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20240513231348.png]]
> 
> However, A still believes it can reach C via B, so it increments the distance received from B by 1 and updates its own distance to C as 3. In the next routing update, A sends this distance of 3 to B, and B updates its distance to C as 4 (A's distance plus 1). This process continues, with the distance incrementing by 1 at each update, until it reaches infinity.

In Distance Vector Routing, when a node receives a routing update from a neighbor, it does NOT always send back an infinite distance. Poison Reverse is only used in specific situations:

1. When a node learns a new route from a neighbor, it updates its routing table with the new information and the distance advertised by the neighbor.

2. The node then advertises this route to its other neighbors (not the one it learned the route from) with the updated distance (the distance advertised by the neighbor plus the cost of the link between them).

3. Poison Reverse comes into play ONLY when a node detects a link failure or a significant change in the network topology that affects a previously known route.

4. In such cases, the node marks the affected route as unreachable (with an infinite distance) in its routing table. This is what we call "poisoning" the route.

5. The node then sends a routing update to all its neighbors, including the one it learned the failed route from, with the infinite distance for the affected route.

6. This poisoned route update informs the neighbors that the specific route is no longer available, and they should not use it to reach the destination.

7. The neighbors, upon receiving the poisoned route update, will update their own routing tables accordingly and propagate the information to their neighbors.

The key difference is that Poison Reverse is used specifically when a node detects a problem with a route, such as a link failure or a significant topology change. In normal operation, when no issues are detected, nodes exchange routing updates with the regular distances and not with infinite distances.

So, to summarize:
- In regular updates, nodes advertise routes with their actual distances.
- Poison Reverse is used only when a node detects a problem with a route.
- In Poison Reverse, the node marks the affected route as unreachable (with an infinite distance) and sends this update to all its neighbors, including the one it learned the route from.
- This helps to quickly propagate the information about the failed route and prevents other nodes from using it.

I hope this clarifies when Poison Reverse is used and how it differs from regular updates. Let me know if you have any further questions!
