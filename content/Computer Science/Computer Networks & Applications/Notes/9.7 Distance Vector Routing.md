> [!idea] Distance Vector Routing
> 
> Distance Vector Routing is a distributed routing algorithm where each node maintains a routing table containing the distance (cost) to every other node in the network and the next hop to reach those nodes. Nodes exchange their routing tables with their directly connected neighbors periodically or when there is a change in the network topology. This information sharing allows nodes to update their routing tables based on the received information and choose the best path to each destination.
> 
> The algorithm follows the Bellman-Ford equation to calculate the shortest path:
> $d_x(y) = min_v\{c(x,v) + d_v(y)\}$
> where $d_x(y)$ is the shortest distance from node $x$ to node $y$, $min_v$ is the minimum over all neighbors $v$ of $x$, $c(x,v)$ is the cost of the link between $x$ and $v$, and $d_v(y)$ is the distance from $v$ to $y$.

> Initially, each node only knows the distance to its directly connected neighbors. Through iterations of the Distance Vector Routing algorithm, the nodes exchange their routing tables and update their knowledge of the network.

> [!consider] Considerations and Limitations
> 
> - Distance Vector Routing can suffer from the "count-to-infinity" problem, where it may take a long time to converge to the correct routing tables after a network topology change. This issue can be mitigated using techniques like split horizon, route poisoning, and holddown timers.
> 
> - The algorithm has a lower computational complexity compared to Link-State Routing but may have slower convergence times.
> 
> - Distance Vector Routing is used in protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).
> 
> - The algorithm assumes that the cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the individual links along the path, which may not always be the case in real-world networks with different quality of service (QoS) requirements.
