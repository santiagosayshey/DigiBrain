> [!idea] Distance Vector Routing: A Distributed Approach to Finding Shortest Paths
> 
> Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is a distributed routing algorithm where each node independently determines the shortest path to every other node.
> - Each node maintains a routing table
> - Each entry in the table has a `cost` and a `via`
> - Each node sends its routing table to its neighbours
> - Each node updates its own table based on the tables sent to it by other nodes

> [!example] Illustrating Distance Vector Routing in Action

> Each node then **begins to exchange its routing table with its neighbors**. Upon receiving the tables from their neighbors, **nodes update their own tables based on the new information**. For instance, node A learns from B that there is a path to C with a distance of 3 (2 from B to C and 1 from A to B). Since this is shorter than the current distance of ∞, node A updates its table to include a path to C via B.

> This process **continues iteratively**, with each node sharing updated routing information until all nodes have converged on the shortest paths to every other node.


> [!consider] Advantages and Limitations of Distance Vector Routing
> 
> Distance Vector Routing offers several advantages:
> - Simplicity: The algorithm is relatively simple to implement and understand.
> - Distributed: Each node independently computes its routing table based on local information.
> - Scalability: DVR can handle large networks with many nodes and links.
> 
> However, DVR also has some limitations:
> - Slow Convergence: In large networks, the convergence process can be slow, especially if link costs change frequently.
> - Routing Loops: DVR is susceptible to routing loops, where packets may get stuck in a cycle due to inconsistent routing tables.
> - Count-to-Infinity Problem: When a link or node fails, it may take a long time for the network to converge due to the propagation of inaccurate distance information.
> 
> To address these limitations, various enhancements and variations of DVR have been proposed, such as split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down timers. These techniques help mitigate routing loops and improve convergence speed.
> 
> Additionally, other routing algorithms, such as Link State Routing (LSR), have been developed to provide faster convergence and more accurate topology information. LSR requires each node to flood the entire network with its link-state information, allowing all nodes to independently compute the shortest paths using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.
