> [!idea]+ Transport Layer Overview
>
> The Transport Layer is **responsible for providing logical communication between processes**. It uses the services of the network layer to try and transfer data between processes, and is limited by the services offered by this layer. There are two main protocols that the transport layer provides - TCP and UDP. 
>
> The fundamental service of TCP and UDP is to take the Network Layer's delivery service, which connects hosts, and extend it to **a delivery service between processes**.

> [!consider]+ TCP vs UDP Comparison
>
> | Feature | TCP | UDP | Description |
> |---------|-----|-----|-------------|
> | **Reliability** | Yes | No | TCP is reliable as it ensures that all data packets are delivered in the order they were sent. UDP does not guarantee delivery or order, making it less reliable. |
> | **Connection Type** | Connection-oriented | Connectionless | TCP establishes a connection before transmitting data, ensuring a dedicated path for communication. UDP sends data without establishing a connection, making it faster but less reliable. |
> | **Speed** | Slower | Faster | TCP's reliability and connection-oriented nature make it slower. UDP's lack of connection establishment and reliability checks makes it faster. |
> | **Data Flow Control** | Yes | No | TCP controls data flow to ensure that the receiver can handle the data rate, preventing data loss. UDP does not have this feature, which can lead to data loss in high-speed transmissions. |
> | **Error Checking** | Yes | Yes | Both TCP and UDP perform error checking. However, TCP also corrects errors by retransmitting lost packets, while UDP simply discards errored packets. |
> | **Usage** | Web browsing, email, file transfers | Streaming media, online gaming, voice over IP (VoIP) | TCP is used for applications that require reliability and order. UDP is used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability. |

> **Question 1**
> Consider a 10 Gb/sec network connection between Adelaide and Sydney. The one way propagation delay to travel the approximately 1000 kms between the two cities is approximately 5 msec. Assuming delays other than propagation are negligible, what window size would be needed to reach 90% link utilization? [4 marks]
> 
> **Question 2**
> Why do pipelined reliable protocols require a sequence numbers space larger than their window size? [3 marks]
> 
> **Question 3**
> When determining the timeout value, what would be the consequence of overestimating or underestimating the time for an ACK to arrive? Would it be better to overestimate or underestimate? Explain.
