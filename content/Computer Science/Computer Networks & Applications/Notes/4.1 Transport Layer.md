> [!idea]+ Transport Layer Overview
>
> The Transport Layer is **responsible for providing logical communication between processes**. It uses the services of the network layer to try and transfer data between processes, and is limited by the services offered by this layer. There are two main protocols that the transport layer provides - TCP and UDP.
>
> The fundamental service of TCP and UDP is to take the Network Layer's delivery service, which connects hosts, and extend it to **a delivery service between processes**. They achieve this through the process of multiplexing and de-multiplexing the data sent by processes.

> [!idea]+ Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
>
> **Multiplexing** refers to the process of combining data from multiple application processes, all destined for transmission across the network, into a single transport-layer protocol defined by their headers. These headers contain the source port (port of the socket sending the data) and the destination port (port of the socket that is receiving the data). The source port is needed to send replies back.
>
> On the other end, **Demultiplexing** is the reverse process. It involves taking data received from the network layer and distributing it to the appropriate application processes based on header information, such as port numbers. This ensures that data intended for different applications or services is correctly routed, allowing multiple applications to share a single network connection without data mix-up.

> [!idea]+ TCP vs UDP Comparison
>
> | Feature | TCP | UDP | Description |
> |---------|-----|-----|-------------|
> | **Reliability** | Yes | No | TCP is reliable as it ensures that all data packets are delivered in the order they were sent. UDP does not guarantee delivery or order, making it less reliable. |
> | **Connection Type** | Connection-oriented | Connectionless | TCP establishes a connection before transmitting data, ensuring a dedicated path for communication. UDP sends data without establishing a connection, making it faster but less reliable. |
> | **Speed** | Slower | Faster | TCP's reliability and connection-oriented nature make it slower. UDP's lack of connection establishment and reliability checks makes it faster. |
> | **Data Flow Control** | Yes | No | TCP controls data flow to ensure that the receiver can handle the data rate, preventing data loss. UDP does not have this feature, which can lead to data loss in high-speed transmissions. |
> | **Error Checking** | Yes | Yes | Both TCP and UDP perform error checking. However, TCP also corrects errors by retransmitting lost packets, while UDP simply discards errored packets. |
> | **Usage** | Web browsing, email, file transfers | Streaming media, online gaming, voice over IP (VoIP) | TCP is used for applications that require reliability and order. UDP is used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability. |
