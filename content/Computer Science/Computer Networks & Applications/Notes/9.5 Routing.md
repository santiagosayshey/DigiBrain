> [!motivation] The Challenge of Routing in Networks
> **Routing data across networks is complex!** We need to be able to determine optimal paths to and from the destination hosts. 
>
> To address this challenge, **routing strategies must be developed to navigate network complexities** while optimizing performance. By leveraging algorithms and **graph theory**, the routing process can be streamlined to enable effective data delivery in various network environments.

> [!idea] Representing Networks as Graphs for Routing
> To approach the routing problem, **networks can be abstracted using the concept of [[8.1 Graphs|graphs]]**. In a graph representation of a network:
> - **Vertices (or nodes)** represent network devices, such as routers or switches
> - **Edges** (or links) represent the connections between these devices
> - **Edge weights** can represent properties like distance, delay, or bandwidth capacity
>
> Modeling networks as graphs allows the application of graph theory principles and algorithms to the routing problem. Routing algorithms can use this abstraction to:
> - Explore and **evaluate possible paths**
> - Find the **shortest path** between a source and destination
