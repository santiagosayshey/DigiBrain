> [!motivation] The Challenge of Routing in Networks
> Routing data across networks is a complex task due to the large number of interconnected devices and the need to find optimal paths for data transmission. The scale and intricacy of modern networks make efficient routing a challenging problem.
>
> To address this challenge, routing strategies must be developed to navigate network complexities while optimizing performance. By leveraging algorithms and graph theory, the routing process can be streamlined to enable effective data delivery in various network environments.

> [!idea] Representing Networks as Graphs for Routing
> To approach the routing problem, networks can be abstracted using the concept of graphs from mathematics. In a graph representation of a network:
> - Vertices (or nodes) represent network devices, such as routers or switches
> - Edges (or links) represent the connections between these devices
> - Edge weights can represent properties like distance, delay, or bandwidth capacity
>
> Modeling networks as graphs allows the application of graph theory principles and algorithms to the routing problem. Routing algorithms can use this abstraction to:
> - Explore and evaluate possible paths
> - Find the shortest or least-cost path between a source and destination
> - Adapt to different network topologies and characteristics
>

> The graph-based approach simplifies the routing problem by focusing on the essential components of the network (devices and their connections) and abstracting away unnecessary details. This enables the development of routing strategies that aim to optimize data transmission and improve communication efficiency in complex network environments.
