> [!motivation] The Challenge of Routing in Networks
> **Routing data across networks is complex!** We need to be able to determine optimal paths to and from the destination hosts. 
>
> To address this challenge, **routing strategies must be developed to navigate network complexities** while optimizing performance. By leveraging algorithms and **graph theory**, the routing process can be streamlined to enable effective data delivery in various network environments.

> [!idea] Representing Networks as Graphs for Routing
> To approach the routing problem, **networks can be abstracted using the concept of [[8.1 Graphs|graphs]]**. In a graph representation of a network:
> - **Vertices (or nodes)** represent network devices, such as routers or switches
> - **Edges** (or links) represent the connections between these devices
> - **Edge weights** can represent properties like distance, delay, or bandwidth capacity
>
> Modeling networks as graphs allows the application of graph theory principles and algorithms to the routing problem. Routing algorithms can use this abstraction to:
> - Explore and **evaluate possible paths**
> - Find the **shortest path** between a source and destination

> [!consider] Comparing Distance Vector and Link State Routing Protocols
> 
> - **Message Complexity**: 
>   - **Distance Vector**: Nodes only need to know about their immediate neighbors. Information is exchanged using periodic updates that contain the entire routing table, leading to potentially high bandwidth usage.
>   - **Link State**: Nodes need to have a complete view of the network topology. Information is exchanged through initial flooding of link-state advertisements (LSAs), which is more bandwidth-efficient over time.
> 
> - **Speed of Convergence**:
>   - **Distance Vector**: Slower to converge due to the periodic updates and the potential for routing loops and count-to-infinity problems. Uses algorithms like Bellman-Ford.
>   - **Link State**: Faster convergence as changes in the network topology are quickly propagated and computed using Dijkstra's algorithm. Less susceptible to routing loops.
> 
> - **Robustness**:
>   - **Distance Vector**: Less robust due to issues like count-to-infinity and routing loops. However, modifications like split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down timers can improve stability.
>   - **Link State**: More robust as the complete network topology view allows for quicker recalculations and adjustments. However, it requires more computational resources and memory.
