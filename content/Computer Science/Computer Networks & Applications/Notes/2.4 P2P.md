> [!idea]+ Client / Server
> The client-server model is a **centralized** form of digital communication, starkly different from the decentralized P2P approach. In this framework, a singular, central server acts as the primary source of resources, services, or data, serving multiple clients that request and consume these offerings.

> [!idea]+ P2P
> Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking is a **decentralized** approach to digital communication, contrasting sharply with the traditional client-server model. In P2P networks, every participant, or "peer," acts both as a client and a server, making resources such as files, content, or bandwidth directly available to other network participants without requiring central coordination by servers.

> Torrents (resources shared amongst users) are split into chunks, where peers inside a torrent swarm send chunks they already have, and receive ones they don't. Chunks are prioritised as rarest first, where users send and receive with their 4 most connectable neighbours. Every 30 seconds, a random peer joins this Quadro and has a chance to join, kicking out another member.
