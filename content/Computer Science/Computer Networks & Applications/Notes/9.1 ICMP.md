> [!idea] ICMP: Purpose and Relation to IP
> ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used by hosts and routers to **communicate network-layer information**.
> - Primary use: **error reporting** (e.g., "Destination network unreachable")
> - ICMP lies **just above IP** in the protocol stack
>   - ICMP messages are **carried as IP payload**, like TCP or UDP segments
>   - When a host receives an IP datagram with ICMP as the upper-layer protocol (protocol number 1), it demultiplexes the datagram's contents to ICMP
>
> ICMP messages have the following format:
> 
> | Field | Description |
> |-------|-------------|
> | Type  | Specifies the type of ICMP message |
> | Code  | Provides additional information about the message type |
> | Header and first 8 bytes of the IP datagram | Helps the sender determine the datagram that caused the error |

> [!idea] ICMP Message Types and Uses
> - ICMP messages are used for various purposes, **not just error reporting**
> - Examples:
>   - Ping: Type 8 Code 0 (echo request), Type 0 Code 0 (echo reply)
>   - Source Quench: Used for congestion control (rarely used in practice)
>   - Traceroute: Utilizes ICMP Time Exceeded (Type 11 Code 0) and Port Unreachable (Type 3 Code 3) messages

> [!example] Ping: Testing Reachability Using ICMP
> ![[Ping-command 1.png]]
> Ping is a basic network utility used to **test the reachability of a host on an IP network**. It uses ICMP echo request and echo reply messages to determine whether a host is accessible and to measure the round-trip time (RTT) for the messages.
>
> Here's how ping works:
>
> 1. The source host sends an ICMP echo request message (Type 8, Code 0) to the target host's IP address.
> 2. If the target host is reachable, it receives the ICMP echo request message and sends an ICMP echo reply message (Type 0, Code 0) back to the source host.
> 3. The source host receives the ICMP echo reply message and calculates the RTT based on the time difference between sending the request and receiving the reply.
> 4. If the target host is not reachable or does not respond within a specified timeout, the source host will not receive an echo reply message.


> [!example] Traceroute
> ![Traceroute Diagram](traceroute_diagram.png)
> Traceroute is a tool that **discovers the path between a source and a destination** host on a network. It works by using the Time to Live (TTL) field in the IP header and the ICMP error messages generated by routers and the destination host.
>
> Here's how Traceroute works:
>
> 1. The source sends a series of IP packets to the destination, each with an increasing TTL value (starting from 1).
> 2. Each router along the path decrements the TTL. When a router receives a packet with a TTL of 0, it discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.
> 3. The destination host sends an ICMP Port Unreachable message when it receives a packet with an unlikely UDP port number.
> 4. The source records the IP addresses of the routers that send ICMP Time Exceeded messages and the destination host's IP address from the ICMP Port Unreachable message.
>
> By analyzing the ICMP messages, Traceroute determines the path and the round-trip time (RTT) for each hop between the source and the destination.


> [!consider] ICMPv6
> - A new version of ICMP has been defined for IPv6 in RFC 4443
> - ICMPv6 reorganizes existing ICMP type and code definitions and adds new types and codes required by IPv6 functionality
>   - Examples: "Packet Too Big" type and "unrecognized IPv6 options" error code
