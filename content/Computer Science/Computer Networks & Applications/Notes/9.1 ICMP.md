> [!idea] ICMP: Purpose and Relation to IP
> ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used by hosts and routers to **communicate network-layer information**.
> - Primary use: **error reporting** (e.g., "Destination network unreachable")
> - ICMP lies **just above IP** in the protocol stack
>   - ICMP messages are **carried as IP payload**, like TCP or UDP segments
>   - When a host receives an IP datagram with ICMP as the upper-layer protocol (protocol number 1), it demultiplexes the datagram's contents to ICMP
>
> ICMP messages have the following format:
> 
> | Field | Description |
> |-------|-------------|
> | Type  | Specifies the type of ICMP message |
> | Code  | Provides additional information about the message type |
> | Header and first 8 bytes of the IP datagram | Helps the sender determine the datagram that caused the error |

> [!idea] ICMP Message Types and Uses
> - ICMP messages are used for various purposes, **not just error reporting**
> - Examples:
>   - Ping: Type 8 Code 0 (echo request), Type 0 Code 0 (echo reply)
>   - Source Quench: Used for congestion control (rarely used in practice)
>   - Traceroute: Utilizes ICMP Time Exceeded (Type 11 Code 0) and Port Unreachable (Type 3 Code 3) messages

> [!example] Ping: 
> Ping is a basic network utility used to **test the reachability of a host on an IP network**. It uses ICMP echo request and echo reply messages to determine whether a host is accessible and to measure the round-trip time (RTT) for the messages.
>
> Here's how ping works:
>
> 1. The source host sends an ICMP echo request message (Type 8, Code 0) to the target host's IP address.
> 2. If the target host is reachable, it receives the ICMP echo request message and sends an ICMP echo reply message (Type 0, Code 0) back to the source host.
> 3. The source host receives the ICMP echo reply message and calculates the RTT based on the time difference between sending the request and receiving the reply.
> 4. If the target host is not reachable or does not respond within a specified timeout, the source host will not receive an echo reply message.

> [!example] Traceroute
> Traceroute **discovers the path between a source and a destination** host by purposely **forcing each router along the way to send an ICMP Time Exceeded message**. Here's how it works:
>
> 1. The source sends UDP packets to the destination, starting with a TTL of 1 and incrementing it by 1 for each subsequent packet.
> 2. Each router decrements the TTL by 1 before forwarding the packet. When a router receives a packet with a TTL of 0, it discards the packet and sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source.
> 3. The source records the IP address and round-trip time (RTT) for each router that sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message.
> 4. When a packet finally reaches the destination, it responds with an ICMP Port Unreachable message due to the unlikely UDP port number.
> 5. The source stops sending packets after receiving the ICMP Port Unreachable message.
>
> By intentionally causing routers to send ICMP Time Exceeded messages, Traceroute maps the path and measures the RTT between the source and each router along the way.

> [!consider] ICMPv6
> - A new version of ICMP has been defined for IPv6 in RFC 4443
> - ICMPv6 reorganizes existing ICMP type and code definitions and adds new types and codes required by IPv6 functionality
>   - Examples: "Packet Too Big" type and "unrecognized IPv6 options" error code
