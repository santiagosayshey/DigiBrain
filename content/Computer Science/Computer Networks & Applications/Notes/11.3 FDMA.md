>
> FDMA divides the available frequency spectrum into multiple non-overlapping channels, each occupying a specific frequency range. This allows multiple devices to communicate simultaneously without interference.
>
> - Each node is allocated a specific frequency band, with the band width determined by the total available bandwidth divided by the number of nodes.
> - For example, with a total bandwidth of 80 MHz and 4 nodes, each node gets a 20 MHz frequency band.
> - Devices can communicate on their assigned frequency bands simultaneously.
