> [!idea] OpenFlow Protocol
> 
> The OpenFlow protocol **enables centralized control over network traffic by allowing controllers to communicate with network devices** like switches and routers.
> 
> **Definition**: OpenFlow is a communication protocol that provides access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or router over the network.
> 
> **Mechanics**: 
> - Flow Tables: OpenFlow switches maintain flow tables containing match fields, counters, and actions. **The switch processes packets by matching them against the flow table entries**.
> - Controller Interaction: The switch **forwards packets to the controller if no match is found, allowing the controller to define new flow entries** dynamically.
> 
> **Relevance**: OpenFlow **facilitates dynamic, real-time adjustments to network behavior**, addressing the limitations of traditional networking by enabling flexible, programmable network management.

> [!example] Example: Packet Processing with OpenFlow
> 
> Imagine a packet arriving at an OpenFlow-enabled switch:
> 
> 1. **Packet Arrival**: The switch inspects the packet header, which includes details like source and destination addresses.
> 2. **Flow Table Lookup**: The switch compares the packet header with entries in its flow table.
> 3. **Action Execution**: If a match is found, the switch executes the corresponding action (e.g., forward, drop, modify).
> 4. **Controller Involvement**: If no match is found, the switch sends the packet to the controller.
> 5. **Flow Table Update**: The controller decides the appropriate action and updates the switchâ€™s flow table for future similar packets.
> 
> This process shows how OpenFlow allows centralized control over packet forwarding, enabling dynamic and adaptable network management.
