Hello!

I would like your assistance in writing concise, modular notes on the topic of [IPv6] The goal is to create notes that are easy to understand and focused on key ideas rather than verbatim copying from textbooks. 

I would like you to format the note using 'callouts'. A callout is defined as a block of text, where each line starts with >. The first line contains the type of callout and the title of the callout. 

> [!callout type] title

Each line after that contains the content of the callout.

Below I have attached each type of callout you may use and a comprehensive overview of what they are used for. This is NOT an overview of the structure of the notes you should be writing. For example, the motivation callout does need to include purpose, key elements and an example. That is just there to explain to you what should be included. If this is not clear, please clarify with me beforehand.

It is vital that these notes are objective. They do NOT make judgements about the correctness or lack of about the ideas they talk about. Here are some examples of what I DONT WANT:

```
In graph theory, tackling the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem efficiently across various scenarios is paramount

This example adds nothing of value and introduces bias. 
```

I DO NOT want an overview or plan first. I want the final deliverable note, formatted as proper callouts as outlined above and below. 

> [!motivation] Motivation
> 
> **Purpose**: Introduce the problem that motivates the need for the main idea. This callout sets the stage, making the upcoming discussion relevant and urgent.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Contextual Introduction**: Start with a real-world scenario or problem that illustrates the need for a solution.
> - **Problem Framing**: Clearly outline the properties or issues that the main idea addresses. Avoid mentioning the solution; focus solely on setting up the problem. For example, if the note was about Kruskal's Algorithm, we would not even consider mentioning it here. It is a solution to this problem.
> 
> **Example**:
> - In project management and network planning, there's often a need to minimize resource usage while achieving maximum efficiency. Imagine trying to connect multiple offices with the least amount of cabling. 
> 
This sets the stage for understanding how we can optimize connections in a network, paving the way for a solution that ensures all nodes are connected with minimal costs.

> [!idea] Main Idea or Concept
> 
> **Purpose**: Explain the core concept or idea that addresses the problem introduced in the motivation callout.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Definition**: Provide a clear, concise definition or explanation of the main concept.
> - **Mechanics**: Describe how the concept works in theoretical or abstract terms.
> - **Relevance**: Tie back to the motivation by explaining how this idea effectively solves the problem.
> 
> **Example**:
> - Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm offers a solution to the minimum spanning tree problem in graph theory. It processes edges of a graph in ascending order of their weights and adds them to the spanning tree, ensuring no cycles are formed, until all vertices are connected. This method efficiently addresses the need for minimal connection costs in networks.

> [!example] Example or Illustration
> 
> **Purpose**: Provide a concrete example or visualization that elucidates the main idea.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Illustrative Example**: Use a specific case, possibly with visual aids or diagrams, to show the idea in action.
> - **Step-by-Step Analysis**: Break down how the example fits or demonstrates the main idea.
> - **Relevance**: Highlight the practical impact or benefits observed in the example.
> 
> **Example**:
> - Consider a network of five nodes where the goal is to connect all nodes with the least total weight. Using Kruskal's Algorithm, we start by selecting the smallest edge, ensuring no cycles are created, and continue until all nodes are interconnected. This process results in a spanning tree with minimized connection costs.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations or Related Ideas
> 
> **Purpose**: Expand on the main idea by introducing related concepts, further implications, or advanced considerations.
> 
> **Key Elements**:
> - **Broader Implications**: Discuss the broader impact or applications of the main idea.
> - **Related Concepts**: Introduce and explain additional theories or ideas that complement or contrast with the main idea.
> - **Complex Considerations**: Address any complexities or nuances that add depth to the understanding of the main idea.
> 
> **Example**:
> - While implementing Kruskal's Algorithm, consider the union-find data structure for efficient cycle detection. Additionally, explore how variations of the algorithm might behave in directed graphs or with negative weights. These considerations are crucial for adapting the algorithm to more complex or specialized scenarios.

This structure ensures that each callout is detailed and purposeful, enhancing the clarity and depth of your notes.
You may also include the following elements in the callouts:

- Tables: Please ensure that tables follow markdown formatting rules.
- Images: Indicate where the image should be placed and provide a description so that I can find or create a suitable image (e.g., drawing a graph to illustrate Dijkstra's algorithm in Figma). This is very important. Whenever you want to include an image, You NEED to describe it. Perhaps write the explanation in a codeblock so that I know it can be deleted later. 
- Math: When including mathematical equations, please use Obsidian's formatting rules - `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for equation blocks.

I have provided additional context on the desired notes below. Please use this information as a guide for what you should write:

For the motivation of this, I would like you to talk about how in classful addressing, we eventually ran out of class B addresses, etc and other problems. 

Below ive attached my notes on IpV4 and other related network layer notes. This note comes after them.

Internet Protocol Note:


> [!idea] Internet Protocol 
>
> Internet Protocol (IP) **assigns unique addresses** to network interfaces on devices, enabling these interfaces to **connect to different networks.** This allows devices to manage and route data across various network paths effectively, ensuring accurate data transmission.
>
> There are multiple versions of IP, including:
> - **IPv4**: The fourth version, which uses a **32-bit address scheme** - 4 billion unique addresses. 
> - **IPv6**: A newer version that uses a **128-bit address scheme** to accommodate the need for more addresses.
> 
> ![[IP Datagram.png]]

> [!consider] Multiple Network Interfaces on Devices
>
> Devices may have **multiple network interfaces**, each assigned a unique IP address. This setup allows a device to **connect to different networks simultaneously**. For example, a server could be connected to an internal network for secure operations and to the public internet for general access. Multiple interfaces also provide alternate routes for data transmission if one link fails.
>
> - **Routers**: Typically have multiple interfaces to manage traffic between different networks, routing data based on its destination.
> - **Hosts**: May also have multiple interfaces to enhance connectivity options and backup.
> - **IP addresses are associated with interfaces, not hosts**: This association allows each interface to act independently on different networks.
You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my mistake. Let me revise the explanation and examples to better reflect the role of routing tables on each device:

> [!idea] IP Datagram Routing: Source to Destination
>
> IP datagrams are routed based on the destination IP address in the header:
>
> 1. **Source Host**: Creates the datagram and checks its routing table to determine if the destination is local or remote.
>
> 2. **Direct Delivery**: If the destination is on the same network, sends the datagram directly to the destination host using its MAC address (obtained via ARP) at the data link layer.
>
> 3. **Router Forwarding**: If the destination is on a remote network, the source host sends the datagram to the next-hop router specified in its routing table for the destination network.
>
> 4. **Hop-by-Hop Routing**: Each router along the path consults its routing table to determine the next-hop router for the destination network until the datagram reaches the destination network.
>
> 5. **Final Router**: The last router, directly connected to the destination network, forwards the datagram to the destination host using its MAC address.
>
> 6. **Destination Host**: Receives the datagram, completing the journey.

> [!example] Forwarding Scenarios
>
> 1. **Local Delivery**: If host A (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to host B (192.168.1.20) on the same network, host A's routing table will specify that the destination is directly reachable through the local network interface. The IP datagram will be sent to the link layer for delivery to host B.
>
> 2. **Remote Delivery (One Router Away)**: If host A (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to host C (192.168.2.20) on a network connected to host A's router, host A's routing table will indicate that the datagram should be forwarded to the router interface connecting the two networks (e.g., 192.168.1.1). The router will then consult its routing table and forward the datagram via the appropriate outgoing interface (e.g., 192.168.2.1) to reach host C's network.
>
> 3. **Remote Delivery (Multiple Routers Away)**: If host A (192.168.1.10) wants to send data to host D (10.0.0.5) on a network multiple routers away, host A's routing table will indicate that the datagram should be forwarded to its default gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.1). The first router will then consult its routing table and forward the datagram to the next-hop router (e.g., 172.16.0.1) on the path to the destination network. This process continues at each intermediate router until the datagram reaches the final router directly connected to the destination network (10.0.0.0/8), which will forward the datagram to host D.
