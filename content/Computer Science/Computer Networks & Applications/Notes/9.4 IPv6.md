> [!motivation] The Age of the Internet
> 
> As the internet expanded, the limitations of IPv4 became increasingly apparent. The most pressing issue was the **exhaustion of address space**. Particularly, the **depletion of Class B addresses** highlighted a critical need for a more extensive addressing scheme to support the growing number of internet-connected devices.
> 
> - **Classful Addressing Limitations**: The fixed boundaries between network and host portions in classful addressing (Classes A, B, and C) led to inefficient IP address distribution.
> - **Rapid Growth**: The explosion in the number of devices and internet usage worldwide necessitated a larger pool of IP addresses.
> - **Future Proofing**: With the advent of IoT and smart devices, a scalable and more flexible addressing model was needed to future-proof the infrastructure.
 
> [!idea] IPv6 Addressing
> 
> IPv6 addresses use  a vastly larger address space to address this demand and improve the efficiency of routing.
> 
> - **128-bit Addressing**: Unlike IPv4's 32-bit system, IPv6 uses 128 bits, exponentially increasing the total number of possible addresses.
> - **Hexadecimal Representation**: IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal, separated by colons, for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
> - **Simplified Routing**: The larger address space allows for a hierarchical structure that simplifies routing and network management.
> - **Improved Auto-configuration**: IPv6 includes features like stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), which simplifies network configurations by allowing devices to generate their own addresses.

> [!example] Example of IPv6 Implementation
> 
> Consider a scenario where a large university previously using multiple Class C networks transitions to IPv6:
> 
> - **Before IPv6**: The university manages multiple Class C addresses, leading to complex routing and underutilized addresses.
> - **With IPv6**: A single IPv6 address can encompass all devices with room for growth, simplifying management and improving network efficiency.
> - **Operational Efficiency**: The transition to IPv6 reduces the administrative overhead and shrinks the size of routing tables, making the network more efficient.

> [!consider] Additional Considerations in IPv6 Transition
> 
> The shift from IPv4 to IPv6 is significant, involving not just expanded address capabilities but also enhanced security and configuration features.
> 
> - **Security Enhancements**: IPv6 inherently supports IPsec, a suite of protocols for securing internet protocol communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet in a data stream.
> - **Backward Compatibility**: Transition mechanisms like dual stacking, where devices run both IPv4 and IPv6, are necessary as the global internet transitions.
> - **Network Policy Updates**: Policies regarding IP address allocation and management must be revised to take full advantage of IPv6 features.
