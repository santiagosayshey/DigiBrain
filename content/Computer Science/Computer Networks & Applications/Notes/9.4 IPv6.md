> [!motivation] The Age of the Internet
> 
> As the internet expanded, the limitations of IPv4 became increasingly apparent. The most pressing issue was the **exhaustion of address space**. Particularly, the **depletion of Class B addresses** highlighted a critical need for a more extensive addressing scheme to support the growing number of internet-connected devices.
> 
> - **Classful Addressing Limitations**: The fixed boundaries between network and host portions in classful addressing (Classes A, B, and C) led to inefficient IP address distribution.
> - **Rapid Growth**: The explosion in the number of devices and internet usage worldwide necessitated a larger pool of IP addresses.
> - **Future Proofing**: With the advent of IoT and smart devices, a scalable and more flexible addressing model was needed to future-proof the infrastructure.
 
> [!idea] IPv6 Addressing
> 
> IPv6 addresses use  a vastly larger address space to address this demand and improve the efficiency of routing.
> 
> - **128-bit Addressing**: Unlike IPv4's 32-bit system, IPv6 uses 128 bits, exponentially increasing the total number of possible addresses. Roughly **1000 addresses per square metre**.
> - **Hexadecimal Representation**: IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal, separated by colons, for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. 
> - **Simplified Routing**: The larger address space allows for a hierarchical structure that simplifies routing and network management.
> - **Improved Auto-configuration**: IPv6 includes features like stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), which simplifies network configurations by allowing devices to generate their own addresses.

Sure, I can expand on the hexadecimal representation of IPv6 addresses. Here's a new idea callout for it:

> \[!consider] IPv6 Address Hexadecimal Representation
>
> In the hexadecimal representation of IPv6 addresses, each address is divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons. Each group represents 16 bits (two bytes) of the 128-bit address.
>
> - **Hexadecimal Digits**: The hexadecimal number system uses 16 digits: 0-9 and A-F (or a-f), where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on.
> - **Leading Zeroes**: Leading zeroes in a group can be omitted. For example, `0042` can be written as `42`.
> - **Consecutive Zeroes**: Any consecutive groups of zeroes can be represented by a double colon (`::`). However, this can only be used once in an address to avoid ambiguity.
>
> **Examples**:
>
> - `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` (standard representation)
> - `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334` (omitting leading zeroes)
> - `2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334` (single group of consecutive zeroes)
> - `2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334` (multiple consecutive groups of zeroes)
>
> By using the hexadecimal representation, IPv6 addresses can be written more compactly compared to their binary form, making them easier to read and manage.

This new idea callout explains the hexadecimal representation in detail, including the division into groups, the use of hexadecimal digits, the omission of leading zeroes, and the representation of consecutive zeroes using the double colon. It also provides several examples to illustrate the different cases.

> [!example] Example of IPv6 Implementation
> 
> Consider a scenario where a large university previously using multiple Class C networks transitions to IPv6:
> 
> - **Before IPv6**: The university manages multiple Class C addresses, leading to complex routing and underutilized addresses.
> - **With IPv6**: A single IPv6 address can encompass all devices with room for growth, simplifying management and improving network efficiency.
> - **Operational Efficiency**: The transition to IPv6 reduces the administrative overhead and shrinks the size of routing tables, making the network more efficient.
