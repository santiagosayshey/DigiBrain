> [!motivation] The Age of the Internet
> 
> As the internet expanded, the limitations of IPv4 became increasingly apparent. The most pressing issue was the **exhaustion of address space**. Particularly, the **depletion of Class B addresses** highlighted a critical need for a more extensive addressing scheme to support the growing number of internet-connected devices.
> 
> - **Classful Addressing Limitations**: The fixed boundaries between network and host portions in classful addressing (Classes A, B, and C) led to inefficient IP address distribution.
> - **Rapid Growth**: The explosion in the number of devices and internet usage worldwide necessitated a larger pool of IP addresses.
> - **Future Proofing**: With the advent of IoT and smart devices, a scalable and more flexible addressing model was needed to future-proof the infrastructure.
 
> [!idea] IPv6 Addressing
> 
> IPv6 addresses use  a vastly larger address space to address this demand and improve the efficiency of routing.
> 
> - **128-bit Addressing**: Unlike IPv4's 32-bit system, IPv6 uses 128 bits, exponentially increasing the total number of possible addresses. Roughly **1000 addresses per square metre**.
> - **Hexadecimal Representation**: IPv6 addresses are written in hexadecimal, separated by colons, for example, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`. 
> - **Simplified Routing**: The larger address space allows for a hierarchical structure that simplifies routing and network management.
> - **Improved Auto-configuration**: IPv6 includes features like stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), which simplifies network configurations by allowing devices to generate their own addresses.

> [!consider] IPv6 Address Hexadecimal Representation
>
> In the hexadecimal representation of IPv6 addresses, each address is divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons. Each group represents 16 bits (two bytes) of the 128-bit address.
>
> - **Hexadecimal Digits**: The hexadecimal number system uses 16 digits: 0-9 and A-F (or a-f), where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on.
> - **Leading Zeroes**: Leading zeroes in a group can be omitted. For example, `0042` can be written as `42`.
> - **Consecutive Zeroes**: Any consecutive groups of zeroes can be represented by a double colon (`::`). However, this can only be used **once** in an address to avoid ambiguity about the position and number of omitted groups.


> [!example] Examples of IPv6 Representation
>
> **Good Examples**:
>
> - `1080:0:0:0:0:9:800:200C:417A` is the same as `1080::9:800:200C:417A` (using `::` for 5 consecutive groups of zeroes)
> - `FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:43` is the same as `FF01::43` (using `::` for 6 consecutive groups of zeroes)
>
> **Bad Examples**:
>
> - `1080::9::800:200C:417A` (using `::` twice, which is ambiguous)
> - `FF01::0:0:43` (using `::` for non-consecutive zeroes, which is invalid)
>
> When using the double colon (`::`) to omit consecutive groups of zeroes, the number of omitted groups can be determined by counting the remaining groups and subtracting that from 8 (the total number of groups in an IPv6 address).
>
> By using the hexadecimal representation, IPv6 addresses can be written more compactly compared to their binary form, making them easier to read and manage.
