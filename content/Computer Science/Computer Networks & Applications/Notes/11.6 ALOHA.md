> [!idea] ALOHA
>
> ALOHA is a simple random access protocol where nodes can transmit data over a shared channel whenever they have data to send, with the possibility for collisions. 

> [!example] Collision Detection and Recovery
> To illustrate how ALOHA handles collisions, consider the following scenario with three nodes: Node A, Node B, and Node C.
>
> 1. **Node A starts transmitting data**
>    - Node A begins sending a data packet over the shared channel.
>    - While transmitting, Node A continuously monitors the channel to detect any collisions.
>
> 2. **Node B also starts transmitting, causing a collision**
>    - Shortly after Node A starts transmitting, Node B also attempts to send a data packet over the same channel.
>    - The signals from Node A and Node B overlap, resulting in a collision on the shared channel.
>
> 3. **Nodes A and B detect the collision**
>    - Both Node A and Node B detect the collision by comparing the signal they are transmitting with the signal they are receiving from the channel.
>    - Since the received signal differs from the transmitted signal, they realize a collision has occurred.
>
> 4. **Nodes A and B generate jam signals**
>    - Upon detecting the collision, both Node A and Node B generate and transmit a jam signal over the channel.
>    - The jam signal is a predefined signal that notifies all nodes that a collision has occurred.
>
> 5. **Node C detects the jam signal**
>    - Node C, which was not initially transmitting, detects the jam signal on the channel.
>    - This indicates to Node C that a collision has occurred, and it should refrain from transmitting until the channel is clear.
>
> 6. **Nodes A and B initiate the backoff procedure**
>    - After transmitting the jam signal, Node A and Node B each wait for a random amount of time (backoff period) before attempting to retransmit their data packets.
>    - The random backoff period helps reduce the probability of another collision during the next transmission attempt.
>
> 7. **Nodes A and B retransmit their data packets**
>    - After the backoff period, Node A and Node B retransmit their respective data packets one at a time, assuming no other node has started transmitting in the meantime.
>    - If another collision occurs, the process repeats from step 3.
>

> [!consider] Regular ALOHA vs. Slotted ALOHA
>
> **Regular ALOHA**:
> - Nodes can transmit data at any time, without any coordination or time synchronization.
> - This simplicity comes at the cost of a higher probability of collisions, especially in networks with higher traffic loads.
> - Collisions can occur when two or more nodes transmit simultaneously, even if their transmissions are partially overlapping.
> - The maximum theoretical channel utilization for regular ALOHA is approximately 18%.
>
> **Slotted ALOHA**:
> - Time is divided into discrete slots, and nodes can only transmit at the beginning of each slot.
> - Nodes are synchronized, so they all start transmitting at the same time within each slot.
> - Collisions can only occur if two or more nodes transmit in the same slot. Partial overlaps are avoided.
> - The maximum theoretical channel utilization for Slotted ALOHA is approximately 37%, almost double that of regular ALOHA.
> - However, Slotted ALOHA requires time synchronization among all nodes, which adds complexity.
>
> In both regular ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA, nodes monitor the channel during transmission to detect collisions and use a backoff procedure with random waiting times to recover from collisions and retransmit their data.
>
> While regular ALOHA is simpler and requires no synchronization, Slotted ALOHA can achieve higher channel utilization by reducing the probability of collisions. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the network, such as the level of traffic, the need for synchronization, and the acceptable level of collisions and retransmissions.

This callout highlights the key differences between regular ALOHA and Slotted ALOHA, including their transmission mechanisms, collision scenarios, maximum theoretical channel utilization, and the trade-off between simplicity and efficiency.
