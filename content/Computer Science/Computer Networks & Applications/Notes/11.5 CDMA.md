> CDMA assigns unique codes to each node, allowing multiple nodes to communicate simultaneously over the same frequency channel without interference.
>
> - Each node is assigned a unique code, which is used to spread its signal across the available frequency spectrum.
> - The code is a sequence of bits that appears random but can be reproduced by the intended receiver.
> - Multiple nodes can transmit simultaneously using different codes, and their signals will be combined in the channel.
> - The receiver uses the same unique code to despread the signal, extracting the original data from the combined signal.
> - The codes are designed to be orthogonal, minimizing interference between nodes.
> - The number of unique codes available determines the maximum number of nodes that can communicate simultaneously.


> [!example] CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
>
> In CDMA, each node (user or device) is assigned a unique code that looks like a random sequence of +1 and -1. These codes have a special property: when you multiply two different codes together and add up the results, you always get zero.
>
> Let's say we have two nodes, A and B, with the following codes:
> - Node A's code: [+1, -1, +1, -1]
> - Node B's code: [+1, +1, -1, -1]
>
> When Node A wants to send a message, it multiplies each bit of its message by its code. For example:
> - If Node A wants to send the message [+1, -1], it multiplies each bit by its code:
>   - +1 × [+1, -1, +1, -1] = [+1, -1, +1, -1]
>   - -1 × [+1, -1, +1, -1] = [-1, +1, -1, +1]
> - The resulting spread signal for Node A is: [+1, -1, +1, -1] + [-1, +1, -1, +1] = [0, 0, 0, 0]
>
> Node B does the same thing with its message and code.
>
> Now, both nodes transmit their spread signals at the same time, and the signals mix together in the air.
>
> When the receiver gets this mixed signal, it can separate the messages from each node by multiplying the mixed signal with each node's code:
> - To get Node A's message, the receiver multiplies the mixed signal by Node A's code and adds up the results.
> - To get Node B's message, the receiver multiplies the mixed signal by Node B's code and adds up the results.
>
> Because of the special property of the codes (when multiplied together, different codes always add up to zero), the receiver can separate the messages from different nodes, even though they were all mixed together in the air.
