> TDMA divides the available time into smaller time slots, each allocated to a single node for communication. This allows multiple devices to share the same frequency channel by taking turns.
>
> - The available time is divided into frames, and each frame is divided into time slots.
> - Each node is allocated a specific time slot within the frame to transmit data, avoiding collisions.
> - The number of time slots per frame depends on the number of nodes in the network.
> - For example, with 4 nodes, each frame would have 4 time slots, one for each node.
