> Satisfy client requests more efficiently by **serving frequently requested data from a cache**, which is a temporary storage area. When a client requests data that exists in the cache, it is delivered much faster than if the server had to fetch it from the main storage, which could involve complex computations or database queries. This approach not only **speeds up the response time** for the client but also **reduces the load on the server**, leading to a more scalable system.
> - Clients send requests to cache
> - If the requested object is in the cache, it is sent back
> - Otherwise, the cache sends a request to the origin server and then returns the object to the client
