> Satisfy client requests more efficiently by **serving frequently requested data from a cache**, which is a temporary storage area. When a client requests data that exists in the cache, it is delivered much faster than if the server had to fetch it from the main storage, which could involve complex computations or database queries. This approach not only **speeds up the response time** for the client but also **reduces the load on the server**, leading to a more scalable system.
> - Clients send requests to cache
> - If the requested object is in the cache, it is sent back
> - Otherwise, the cache sends a request to the origin server and then returns the object to the client

| Assumption | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Average object size | 1 Mbit |
| Average request rate from browsers to origin servers | 1.5/sec |
| Average data rate to browsers | 15 Mbps |
| RTT from the Internet side of the access link to an origin server | 2 seconds |
| Access link rate | 15 Mbps |

| Consequence | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| LAN utilization | 15% |
| Access link utilization | 100% (Problem!) |
| Total delay | Internet delay + access delay + LAN delay (2 sec + minutes + usecs) |

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Cache hit rate | 0.4 | 40% of requests are satisfied at the cache, 60% at the origin. |
| Access link utilization | 60% | Only 60% of requests use the access link because of cache hits. |
| Data rate to browsers over access link | 9 Mbps | Calculated as 0.6 * 15 Mbps since only 60% of the data comes from the origin servers. |
| Utilization | 60% | 9 Mbps out of the 15 Mbps access link. |
| Total delay | ~1.2 seconds | 0.6 * (delay from origin servers) + 0.4 * (~10 ms LAN or cache delay). |

| Note | Description |
|------|-------------|
| - | Neglected to LAN delay and access link delay are negligible compared to other delays. |
