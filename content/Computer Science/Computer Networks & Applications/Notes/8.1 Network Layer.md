> [!consider] Abstracting the mail delivery process
>
> The application and transport layers allow us to package data into packets and address them for delivery, similar to placing letters in a mailbox. But **how do these packets actually reach their destination**?
>
> **The network layer is responsible for this process.** It **acts as the postal service of the internet,** determining the best route to deliver packets to their destination. The network layer provides a **best-effort delivery service**, meaning it does not guarantee reliable or timely delivery of packets.

> [!idea] The network layer: Routing packets across networks
>
> The network layer is **responsible for determining the best route to deliver a packet to its destination.** 
>
> Routers **make independent decisions based on their routing tables** to forward packets toward their final destination. This process continues until the packet reaches the intended recipient.


> [!idea] Datagrams
>
> In a packet-switched network, **data is divided into smaller, self-contained units called packets or datagrams**. Each datagram contains a source and destination address and can be **independently routed through the network**, allowing for efficient use of network resources.
>
> This is in contrast to circuit-switched networks, where a dedicated communication channel is established between the source and destination for the duration of the communication session.
>
> Key points about datagrams:
> - **Packets may take different paths** from source to destination, depending on network conditions and routing decisions.
> - The network layer has **no concept of a connection** between the source and destination.
> - Routers maintain **no state information about end-to-end connections**, treating each datagram independently.
> - Circuit-switched networks require **connection establishment and teardown overhead**, which can be costly in terms of time and resources.
