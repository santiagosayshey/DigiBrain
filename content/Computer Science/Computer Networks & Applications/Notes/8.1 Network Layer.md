> [!consider] How does mail travel from one mailbox to another?
> When you drop a letter into a mailbox, it doesn't instantly appear in the recipient's mailbox. Instead, the postal service takes care of routing the letter through various facilities until it reaches its destination. Similarly, the network layer in computer networks is responsible for **routing data packets** from the source device to the destination device.
