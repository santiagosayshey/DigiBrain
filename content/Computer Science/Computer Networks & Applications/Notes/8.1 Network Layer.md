> [!consider] Abstracting the mail delivery process
>
> The application and transport layers allow us to package data into packets and address them for delivery, similar to placing letters in a mailbox. But **how do these packets actually reach their destination**?
>
> **The network layer is responsible for this process.** It **acts as the postal service of the internet,** routing and delivering packets from the source to the destination. Just as the postal service ensures that mail gets from one mailbox to another, the network layer abstracts the process of moving data packets across networks, making the transmission process seem seamless to the upper layers.
