> [!consider] Abstracting the mail delivery process
>
> The application and transport layers allow us to package data into packets and address them for delivery, similar to placing letters in a mailbox. But **how do these packets actually reach their destination**?
>
> **The network layer is responsible for this process.** It **acts as the postal service of the internet,** routing and delivering packets from the source to the destination. Just as the postal service ensures that mail gets from one mailbox to another, the network layer abstracts the process of moving data packets across networks, making the transmission process seem seamless to the upper layers.

> [!idea] The network layer: Routing packets across networks
>
> The network layer is responsible for **routing data packets from the source to the destination**. It examines the destination address on each packet and determines the best path for it to take across multiple networks.
>
> Routers **make independent decisions based on their routing tables** to forward packets toward their final destination. This process continues until the packet reaches the intended recipient.
