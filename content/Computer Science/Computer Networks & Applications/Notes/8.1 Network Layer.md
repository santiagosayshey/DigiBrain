> Up to this point in our exploration of network protocols, both the application and transport layers have worked in a way that abstracts the actual movement of data packets. It's like putting a letter in a mailbox; we donâ€™t see the complexities of the delivery process, just the result of the letter arriving at its destination. The network layer, however, pulls back the curtain on this 'magic.' It's responsible for routing and forwarding the packets across the complex mesh of networks that constitute the internet. This is where we delve into how data actually travels from one computer to another, traversing various intermediary nodes and networks until it reaches its final destination. The network layer reveals the 'hows' and 'whys' of data transportation, laying out the map for our packets' journey.
