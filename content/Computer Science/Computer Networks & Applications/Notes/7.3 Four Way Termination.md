> [!consider]+ Consider the Two Generals Problem:
> Two generals, each commanding a group positioned on separate hills, need to coordinate an attack on a common enemy located in the valley between them. However, their **only means of communication is through unreliable terrain**. Consequently, neither general can be completely certain that their coordinated time of attack have been mutually confirmed. This dilemma mirrors the challenges in TCP termination, where **hosts cannot be certain that the other has agreed to end the connection** due to potential message loss.

> [!idea]+ TCP Four-Way Handshake:
> Although TCP cannot completely eliminate the risks highlighted by the Two Generals Problem, it attempts to minimize them through a structured **four-way handshake**:
> 1. **Initiate Closure**: The client sends a **FIN** packet, signaling it has finished sending data but can still receive.
> 2. **Acknowledge Closure**: The server responds with an **ACK**, indicating it has received the **FIN** and understands the client's intent to close.
> 3. **Ready to Close**: The server then sends its own **FIN** packet, showing it too has ceased sending data.
> 4. **Final Acknowledgment**: The client sends a final **ACK**, acknowledging the server's **FIN**. After sending this ACK, the client enters a "timed wait" state.
>
> - **Note**: The **FIN** flag in the TCP headers is signals the start and acknowledgment of termination phases. 
> - **Timed Wait**: The client waits for a period of time sufficient to ensure the server has received its final ACK, to ensure that if the final ACK was lost, there is enough time for the server to retransmit its **FIN** packet, prompting another **ACK** from the client. This step prevents the possibility of the server hanging in close-wait state, thinking it still needs to receive an acknowledgment, and also guards against creating new connections that might confuse old duplicate packets as new data.
