> [!consider]+ Consider the Two Generals Problem:
> Two generals, each commanding a group positioned on separate hills, need to coordinate an attack on a common enemy located in the valley between them. However, their **only means of communication is through unreliable terrain**. Consequently, neither general can be completely certain that their coordinated time of attack have been mutually confirmed. This dilemma mirrors the challenges in TCP termination, where **hosts cannot be certain that the other has agreed to end the connection** due to potential message loss.

> [!idea]+ TCP Four-Way Handshake:
> Although TCP cannot completely eliminate the risks highlighted by the Two Generals Problem, it attempts to minimize them through a structured **four-way handshake**:
> 1. **Initiate Closure**: A host sends a **FIN** packet, signaling it has finished sending data but can still receive.
> 2. **Acknowledge Closure**: The other host responds with an **ACK**, indicating it received the **FIN** and understands the closure intent.
> 3. **Ready to Close**: The receiver sends its own **FIN** packet, showing it too has ceased sending data.
> 4. **Final Acknowledgment**: The initiating host sends a final **ACK**, recognizing the receiver's **FIN**. This process significantly enhances the probability of both parties understanding that the connection is properly concluding, thus making TCP termination as reliable as possible within the constraints of an imperfect communication medium.
