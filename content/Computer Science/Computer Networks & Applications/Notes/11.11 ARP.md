> [!idea] Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
>
> **ARP maps logical IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a LAN**. Devices use ARP to discover the MAC address associated with a target IP address, enabling accurate data frame delivery between devices on the same LAN segment.

> [!example] ARP in Action
>
> Consider a LAN with two devices, Device A (IP: 192.168.1.100) and Device B (IP: 192.168.1.200).
>
> 1. Device A wants to send data to Device B but only knows its IP address (192.168.1.200).
> 2. Device A checks its ARP cache but does not find the MAC address for 192.168.1.200.
> 3. Device A broadcasts an ARP request message onto the LAN: "Who has IP 192.168.1.200? Tell me your MAC address."
> 4. Device B recognizes its IP address and responds with an ARP reply: "192.168.1.200 is at MAC address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF."
> 5. Device A updates its ARP cache with the IP-to-MAC mapping and can now send data frames to Device B using its MAC address (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF) as the destination.
