> [!motivation] Need for Address Resolution in Network Communication
> 
> In a computer network, c**ommunication between devices requires both IP addresses and MAC addresses.** While IP addresses are used for logical addressing and routing packets across networks, MAC addresses are essential for delivering frames within a local network segment. However, w**hen a device knows the IP address of the target host but not its MAC address, it faces the challenge of determining the corresponding MAC address** to enable successful communication.

> [!idea] Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
> 
> The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a network protocol **used to discover the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.** It is a vital protocol in the Internet Protocol Suite used to map IP addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. ARP operates between the network and data link layers of the OSI model, enabling communication between devices on a local area network (LAN) by translating IP addresses to MAC addresses.

> [!example] ARP in Action: Resolving IP to MAC Address
> 
> Consider a scenario where a host with IP address 192.168.1.100 wants to communicate with another host with IP address 192.168.1.200 on the same local network. The sender knows the target IP address but not the MAC address. ARP resolves this issue through the following steps:
> 
> 1. The sender broadcasts an ARP request packet to all devices on the local network, asking, "Who has IP address 192.168.1.200? Tell 192.168.1.100."
> 2. All devices on the network receive the ARP request, but only the host with IP address 192.168.1.200 recognizes its IP and responds with an ARP reply containing its MAC address.
> 3. The sender receives the ARP reply, stores the IP-to-MAC address mapping in its ARP cache for future reference, and proceeds to send the data packet to the target host using the obtained MAC address.

> [!consider] ARP Cache and Security Considerations
> 
> - **ARP Cache**: To minimize the need for repeated ARP requests, each device maintains an ARP cache that stores recently resolved IP-to-MAC address mappings. The cache entries have a limited lifetime, typically a few minutes, to accommodate network changes.
> 
> - **ARP Spoofing**: ARP is a stateless protocol and lacks authentication, making it vulnerable to spoofing attacks. An attacker can send fake ARP replies, associating their MAC address with the IP address of another host, thereby intercepting traffic intended for that host. This highlights the importance of implementing security measures like packet filtering and monitoring for suspicious ARP activities.
> 
> - **Proxy ARP**: In some network configurations, a router or a network device can respond to ARP requests on behalf of another device. This technique, called Proxy ARP, allows communication between hosts on different subnets without the need for the sender to know the target's MAC address or the network topology.
