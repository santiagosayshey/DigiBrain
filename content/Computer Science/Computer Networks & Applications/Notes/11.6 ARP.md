> [!motivation] The Need for Address Resolution
> In an IP network, **devices need a way to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses to enable communication**. Imagine trying to send a letter without knowing the recipient's street address - that's the problem ARP solves for network devices.

> [!idea] Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
> - Definition: ARP is a protocol **used to discover the link layer address (MAC address) associated with a given network layer address (IP address)**.
> - How it works: 
>   1. When a device needs to send data to another device on the local network, it checks its ARP cache for the MAC address corresponding to the destination IP. 
>   2. If not found, the sender broadcasts an ARP request to all devices on the network, asking "Who has this IP address?"
>   3. The device with the matching IP responds with its MAC address.
>   4. The sender updates its ARP cache and sends the data to the destination MAC address.
> - Relevance: ARP enables efficient communication by providing the necessary mapping between IP and MAC addresses on a local network.


> [!example] ARP in Action
> When a PC wants to communicate with a web server on the local network:
> 1. PC checks its ARP cache for the MAC address of the web server's IP. Not found.
> 2. PC broadcasts an ARP request: "Who has IP 192.168.1.100?"
> 3. Web server responds: "I have 192.168.1.100. My MAC address is 00:1A:7D:DA:71:13."
> 4. PC updates its ARP cache:
> 
> | IP Address   | MAC Address       |
> |--------------|-------------------|
> | 192.168.1.100 | 00:1A:7D:DA:71:13 |
>
> 5. PC sends the HTTP request to the web server's MAC address.
