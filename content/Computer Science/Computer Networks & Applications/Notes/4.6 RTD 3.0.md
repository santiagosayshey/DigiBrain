> The sender now waits a "reasonable" amount of time for an ACK, and retransmits if there is a timeout. If the ACK was delayed, sequence numbers are able to handle duplicates.

> We can see that the biggest issue with RTD3.0 is selecting the right timeout duration. Too long and we're wasting time waiting to transmit. Too short and we lead to a bunch of duplicates. Eventually all of these will resolve but it does affect performance.

> [!consider] The Need for Pipelining in Reliable Data Transfer Protocols
> In high-speed networks with significant propagation delays and small packet sizes, the utilization of available bandwidth can be severely limited when using simple stop-and-wait protocols. Consider the following example:
> 
> - 1 Gbps link with 15 ms end-to-end propagation delay
> - 1 KB packet size
> - Packet transmission time (T_transmit) = 8 microseconds/packet
> - Sender utilization (U) = 0.00027 or 0.027%
> 
> In this scenario, even with a high-speed 1 Gbps link, the throughput is limited to only 33 KB/sec due to the propagation delay and small packet size. The sender spends most of its time waiting for acknowledgments (ACKs) before sending the next packet, resulting in poor utilization of the available bandwidth.
> 
> To address this issue, pipelining is introduced in reliable data transfer (RDT) protocols. [[Pipelining]] allows multiple data packets to be in transit simultaneously, without waiting for individual ACKs. By leveraging sequence numbers, timers, and efficient retransmission mechanisms, pipelining enables the sender to fully utilize the available bandwidth and significantly improve throughput.

> Pipelining is a crucial technique in advanced RDT protocols, as it overcomes the limitations of simple stop-and-wait approaches and ensures efficient data transfer in high-speed networks with substantial propagation delays.
