> - We only need two numbers to identify retransmitted packets. A receiver checks the sequence number of each incoming packet. If the sequence number is new, the receiver processes the packet and sends an ACK. If the sequence number is the same as a previously received packet, the receiver discards the duplicate and sends an ACK. The sender and receiver alternate between sequence numbers 0 and 1 for each successful transmission.

Maybe we can we use a **single ACK to determine if the message was received or not**. We can do this by adding the SQ number to the ACK. Adding the right sequence number indicates an ACK, and the wrong one indicates a NAK.
