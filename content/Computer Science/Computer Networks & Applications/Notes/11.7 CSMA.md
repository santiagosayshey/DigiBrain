> [!idea] Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
> 
> CSMA is a media access control protocol that allows multiple nodes to efficiently share a common transmission medium. Nodes **listen to the channel before transmitting to avoid collision**s. If the channel is busy, the node defers transmission until it becomes idle.

> [!consider] CSMA vs. ALOHA
>
> - CSMA uses carrier sensing, while ALOHA allows nodes to transmit without checking the channel state.
> - CSMA has a lower collision probability and higher channel utilization compared to ALOHA.
> - CSMA is more complex, requiring nodes to sense the channel and defer transmission when necessary.


> [!example] CSMA Collision Handling
> 
> **Non-Persistent CSMA:**
>
> 1. Node A senses the channel and finds it busy. It waits for a random backoff period before sensing the channel again.
> 2. After the backoff period, Node A senses the channel again. If the channel is idle, it transmits. If the channel is still busy, it waits for another random backoff period before sensing again.
> 3. This process continues until Node A finds the channel idle and transmits its data.
>
> **Persistent CSMA:**
>
> 1. Node A and Node B sense the channel, find it idle, and start transmitting simultaneously.
> 2. A collision occurs, and both nodes detect it.
> 3. After the collision, Node A and Node B immediately attempt to retransmit their packets with probability p.
> 4. If a node does not retransmit (with probability 1-p), it continuously senses the channel until it becomes idle and then immediately attempts to retransmit with probability p.
> 5. If the retransmission results in another collision, the nodes involved repeat steps 3 and 4.
> 6. This process continues until one of the nodes successfully transmits its packet without collision.

> \[!consider\] Can collisions still occur in CSMA?

>

> Yes, collisions can still occur in CSMA due to the propagation delay of sensing and the possibility of two or more nodes sensing the channel simultaneously.

>

> 1. **Propagation delay:** When a node begins transmitting, it takes a small amount of time for the signal to propagate through the medium and be detected by other nodes. During this brief period, another node might sense the channel, find it idle, and start transmitting, leading to a collision.

>

> 2. **Simultaneous sensing:** If two or more nodes sense the channel at the same time and find it idle, they may begin transmitting simultaneously, resulting in a collision. This is more likely to occur when the network traffic is high, and many nodes are competing for channel access.

>

> Although CSMA reduces the probability of collisions compared to ALOHA, it does not eliminate them entirely due to these factors. Techniques like collision detection (CSMA/CD) and collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) are used to further mitigate the impact of collisions in CSMA-based networks.
