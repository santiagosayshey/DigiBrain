> [!idea] Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
> 
> CSMA is a media access control protocol that allows multiple nodes to efficiently share a common transmission medium. Nodes **listen to the channel before transmitting to avoid collision**s. If the channel is busy, the node defers transmission until it becomes idle.

> [!consider] CSMA vs. ALOHA
>
> - CSMA uses carrier sensing, while ALOHA allows nodes to transmit without checking the channel state.
> - CSMA has a lower collision probability and higher channel utilization compared to ALOHA.
> - CSMA is more complex, requiring nodes to sense the channel and defer transmission when necessary.

> 1. Node A and B sense the channel, find it idle, and start transmitting simultaneously.
> 2. Collision occurs, and nodes A and B detect it.
> 3. Nodes A and B stop transmitting and enter a random backoff period.
> 4. After the backoff, nodes A and B sense the channel again. If the channel is idle, they transmit. If the channel is busy, they enter another random backoff period.

> 1. Node A and B sense the channel, find it idle, and start transmitting simultaneously.
> 2. Collision occurs, and nodes A and B detect it.
> 3. Nodes A and B stop transmitting but continuously sense the channel.
> 4. As soon as the channel becomes idle, nodes A and B attempt to transmit again, potentially leading to another collision.
> 5. If a collision occurs again, the process repeats from step 3. If one node successfully transmits, the other node waits for the next idle period to transmit.
