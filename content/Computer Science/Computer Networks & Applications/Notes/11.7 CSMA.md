> [!idea] Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
> 
> CSMA is a media access control protocol that allows multiple nodes to efficiently share a common transmission medium. Nodes **listen to the channel before transmitting to avoid collision**s. If the channel is busy, the node defers transmission until it becomes idle.

> [!consider] CSMA vs. ALOHA
>
> - CSMA uses carrier sensing, while ALOHA allows nodes to transmit without checking the channel state.
> - CSMA has a lower collision probability and higher channel utilization compared to ALOHA.
> - CSMA is more complex, requiring nodes to sense the channel and defer transmission when necessary.


> [!example] CSMA Collision Handling
> 
> **Non-Persistent CSMA:**
>
> 1. Node A senses the channel and finds it busy. It waits for a random backoff period before sensing the channel again.
> 2. After the backoff period, Node A senses the channel again. If the channel is idle, it transmits. If the channel is still busy, it waits for another random backoff period before sensing again.
> 3. This process continues until Node A finds the channel idle and transmits its data.
>
> **Persistent CSMA:**
>
> 1. Node A and Node B sense the channel, find it idle, and start transmitting simultaneously.
> 2. A collision occurs, and both nodes detect it.
> 3. After the collision, Node A and Node B immediately attempt to retransmit their packets with probability p.
> 4. If a node does not retransmit (with probability 1-p), it continuously senses the channel until it becomes idle and then immediately attempts to retransmit with probability p.
> 5. If the retransmission results in another collision, the nodes involved repeat steps 3 and 4.
> 6. This process continues until one of the nodes successfully transmits its packet without collision.
