> [!motivation] Ensuring Secure Systems
> With the increasing reliance on computer networks and applications, ensuring their security has become crucial. **Human error**, such as misconfigurations, poor coding practices, or lack of awareness, often **introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors**, leading to data breaches, system compromises, and other severe consequences.

> [!idea] Addressing Security Vulnerabilities
> **Addressing security vulnerabilities is essential to protect computer systems** and applications from potential threats. This can be achieved through various measures, including:
> 
> - Implementing secure coding practices and guidelines during software development.
> - Conducting regular security testing, such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
> - Establishing processes for continuous security monitoring and timely patching.
> - Raising awareness and providing training on security best practices for users and administrators.
> - Adopting secure system configurations and hardening techniques.
> - Implementing access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.

> [!example] Alice, Bob, and Eve: Security Threats
> Alice and Bob are users of an encrypted messaging application. Eve is a **malicious actor attempting to compromise the security of their communication**.
>

>
> If vulnerabilities exist, Eve might exploit them to:
>
> - **Eavesdrop**: Intercept and read encrypted messages by exploiting flaws in the encryption implementation or key management.
> - **Impersonate**: Gain unauthorized access by bypassing authentication mechanisms due to vulnerabilities.
> - **Hijack Sessions**: Take control of an ongoing communication session between Alice and Bob by exploiting session management vulnerabilities.
> - **Launch DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelm the messaging application with a high volume of traffic, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users like Alice and Bob.
