> [!motivation] Ensuring Secure Systems
> With the increasing reliance on computer networks and applications, ensuring their security has become crucial. **Human error**, such as misconfigurations, poor coding practices, or lack of awareness, often **introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors**, leading to data breaches, system compromises, and other severe consequences.

> [!idea] Addressing Security Vulnerabilities
> **Addressing security vulnerabilities is essential to protect computer systems** and applications from potential threats. This can be achieved through various measures, including:
> 
> - Implementing secure coding practices and guidelines during software development.
> - Conducting regular security testing, such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
> - Establishing processes for continuous security monitoring and timely patching.
> - Raising awareness and providing training on security best practices for users and administrators.
> - Adopting secure system configurations and hardening techniques.
> - Implementing access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.

> [!example] Alice, Bob, and Eve: Security Threats
> Alice and Bob are users of an encrypted messaging application. Eve is a **malicious actor attempting to compromise the security of their communication**.
> 
> ![[4Hc43.jpg|500]]
>
> If vulnerabilities exist, Eve might exploit them to:
>
> - **Eavesdrop**: Intercept and read encrypted messages by exploiting flaws in the encryption implementation or key management.
> - **Impersonate**: Gain unauthorized access by bypassing authentication mechanisms due to vulnerabilities.
> - **Hijack Sessions**: Take control of an ongoing communication session between Alice and Bob by exploiting session management vulnerabilities.
> - **Launch DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelm the messaging application with a high volume of traffic, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users like Alice and Bob.

> [!idea] Network Security Threats and Attacks
>
> | Threat/Attack | Description | Examples |
> |----------------|--------------|----------|
> | Packet Sniffing | **Capturing and inspecting network traffic** to intercept sensitive data, monitor activity, or identify security threats and anomalies. | - A malicious actor sets up a packet sniffer to capture unencrypted messages between Alice and Bob.<br>- A security analyst uses a packet sniffer to monitor network traffic for unauthorized access attempts or malware activity. |
> | IP Spoofing | **Disguising the source IP address of network packets to impersonate** trusted systems, bypass security controls, launch DDoS attacks, or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks. | - Eve spoofs a trusted IP address to gain unauthorized access to a network or service.<br>- Eve's botnet launches a DDoS attack with spoofed source IP addresses to conceal the real origin of the attack traffic. |
