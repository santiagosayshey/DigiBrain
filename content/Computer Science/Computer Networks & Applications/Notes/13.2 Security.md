> [!motivation] Ensuring Secure Systems
> With the increasing reliance on computer networks and applications, ensuring their security has become crucial. **Human error**, such as misconfigurations, poor coding practices, or lack of awareness, often **introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors**, leading to data breaches, system compromises, and other severe consequences.

> [!idea] Addressing Security Vulnerabilities
> **Addressing security vulnerabilities is essential to protect computer systems** and applications from potential threats. This can be achieved through various measures, including:
> 
> - Implementing secure coding practices and guidelines during software development.
> - Conducting regular security testing, such as vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
> - Establishing processes for continuous security monitoring and timely patching.
> - Raising awareness and providing training on security best practices for users and administrators.
> - Adopting secure system configurations and hardening techniques.
> - Implementing access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.

> [!example] Alice, Bob, and Eve: Illustrating Security Vulnerabilities
> Consider the following scenario involving Alice, Bob, and Eve:
>
> Alice and Bob are users of a secure messaging application that employs end-to-end encryption to protect their communication from unauthorized access. However, **Eve is a malicious actor attempting to intercept and read their messages.**
> 
> ![[4Hc43.jpg|500]]
>
> If the messaging application has a vulnerability in its encryption implementation or key management system, Eve might be able to exploit this vulnerability and gain access to the encrypted messages, compromising the confidentiality of Alice and Bob's communication.
