> Consider a packet flowing through the Internet over 2 hops (source -> router1 -> destination). Assume that it takes the router 1 msec to process a packet and determine the outgoing link. The simplified network is shown below:

Since there is no other traffic at the router, we should consider 3 types of delay - Propagation, Transmission and Processing.

- Propagation - $\frac{distance}{speed}$
