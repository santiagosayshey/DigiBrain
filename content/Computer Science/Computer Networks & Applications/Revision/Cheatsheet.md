# The Postal Analogy

- Data encapsulation in networks is like putting a letter inside multiple envelopes
- Each OSI layer adds its own "envelope" (header) to the data
- Application layer data = the letter itself
- Headers are added from top to bottom layers
- Headers are removed from bottom to top layers at the receiving end

| <center>Propagation Delay</center>  | The time it takes for a signal to travel from point A to point B over a network medium. It is influenced by the type of medium, the distance between the points, and typically the speed of the signal, which is often close to $c$, the speed of light $(3 \times 10^8$ m/s) in vacuum. | $$t_p=\frac{Distance}{Speed}$$              |
| <center>Transmission Delay</center> | The time required to transmit all the bits of a packet into the network medium. Packet size is denoted by $L$, and the bandwidth (data carrying capacity) is denoted by $R$.                                                                                                             | $$t_T=\frac{L}{R}$$                         |
| <center>Queuing Delay</center>      | The time a packet spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted over the network due to congestion or prior packet processing. If there is no space in the queue (i.e. not enough buffer in the router), that packet is dropped!                                                | Depends on queue length and network traffic |
| <center>Processing Delay</center>   | The time taken by a network device (e.g., router, switch) to process a packet.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Depends on device and packet complexity     |
# Application Layer Protocols

Application layer protocols define the rules for communication between applications running on different devices. They specify the types of messages exchanged, their format (syntax), meaning (semantics), and how and when they should be exchanged.

| Protocol | Key Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
