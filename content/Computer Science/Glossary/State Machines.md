>
> A state machine is a mathematical model used to represent the behavior of a system. It consists of a finite number of states and transitions between those states, which are triggered by events or conditions.
>
> Here's how state machines work:
>
> - 🔵 **States**: Each state represents a unique configuration or mode of the system at a given time. For example, a traffic light can have states like "red," "yellow," and "green."
> - ➡️ **Transitions**: Transitions define how the system moves from one state to another based on specific events or conditions. For instance, a traffic light transitions from "red" to "green" when the timer expires.
> - 🎚️ **Inputs**: Inputs are external events or conditions that trigger state transitions. In the traffic light example, a timer expiration is an input that triggers the transition from "red" to "green."
> - 🎛️ **Outputs**: Outputs are actions or behaviors that the system performs in each state. For example, when a traffic light is in the "green" state, it allows vehicles to pass through the intersection.
>
> State machines provide a clear and structured way to define and visualize the behavior of a system. They help in designing, implementing, and reasoning about complex systems by breaking them down into well-defined states and transitions.
>
> By using state machines, you can:
>
> - 🗺️ Model and understand the different states and transitions of a system.
> - 🎨 Visualize the system's behavior using state diagrams or transition tables.
> - 🔧 Implement the system's logic based on the defined states and transitions.
> - 🔍 Analyze and verify the correctness and completeness of the system's behavior.

> State machines are widely used in various domains, such as embedded systems, game development, user interface design, and more. They provide a powerful tool for modeling and simplifying complex system behavior.
