> Recurrence relations are like a family tree for numbers, where each number has 'parents' that came before it. In programming, they're rules that help us understand recursive functions â€” functions that call themselves to solve problems. They tell us how each step of the problem relates to the previous steps. This is super useful because it helps us figure out how complex a recursive function is, that is, how long it might take to run or how much memory it'll use as the problem it's solving gets bigger. Essentially, they map out the blueprint for the solution that a recursive function follows, step by step.
