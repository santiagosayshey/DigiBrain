> Sorting algorithms take raw data and order it following specific rules, enhancing searchability and analysis. This is extremely useful for optimizing tasks such as database querying and algorithm performance. We rank them based on complexity—using Big O notation—to help us select the appropriate algorithm for the task's time and space constraints.
