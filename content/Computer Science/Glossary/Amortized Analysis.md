> [!idea] Amortized Analysis
>
> Amortized analysis is a method used to **analyse the time complexity of algorithms involving a sequence of operations**.
>
> Key points to remember:
> - Amortized analysis provides the average cost per operation over a worst-case sequence of operations.
> - It "spreads out" the cost of expensive operations over the entire sequence.
> - The total cost of a sequence is analyzed, and the average cost per operation is calculated.
> - Techniques used in amortized analysis include:
>   - Aggregate method
>   - Accounting method
>   - Potential method
> - Amortized analysis is useful for data structures with operations that have varying costs.
> - It provides a more accurate and practical analysis of time complexity compared to worst-case analysis of individual operations.
