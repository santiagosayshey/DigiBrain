# üë®‚Äçüíª What is a Program?

A program is a set of written instructions that tell a computer to do something. 

```python
print("Hello, World!"); # this program says hello!
```

**Programs automate things for us.**  Instead of printing the same line 5 times, we use a more efficient [For Loop](For%20Loop.md) to achieve the same thing!

 ```python
for i in range(5): 
	print("Hello World"); # this programs says hello 5 times!
```

Programs consist of:
1. Data - any value that might be used as part of an instruction - numbers, words, Booleans (true / false), sets. These are more commonly referred to as [Variables](Variables.md)
2. Operations - actions that we perform on data using [Operands](Operands.md) ( -, +, /, x)

Programs enable us to automate and streamline tasks, making complex processes simple. They transform data and instructions into actions, helping us solve problems and accomplish tasks quickly across various fields like software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and web design.
