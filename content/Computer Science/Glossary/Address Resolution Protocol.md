> [!idea] ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
>
> ARP is a protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC (Media Access Control) addresses in a local network segment. It is essential for communication between devices within a network.
>
> - When a device wants to communicate with another device on the local network, it needs to know the MAC address of the target device.
> - The source device sends an ARP request broadcast, asking for the MAC address associated with a specific IP address.
> - The device with the matching IP address responds with its MAC address, allowing the source device to send data packets directly to the intended recipient.
> - ARP is a stateless protocol, meaning that devices do not keep track of ARP replies received from other devices.
