> [!idea] Routing Protocol Backdoor in Secure Chat System
> - **Concept**: Create a custom routing protocol with an intentional vulnerability
> - **Implementation**:
>   - Use a modified distance vector routing algorithm
>   - Allow negative cost values in routing updates
>   - Malicious node advertises impossibly low (negative) costs to all destinations
> - **Backdoor Mechanics**:
>   - Malicious node becomes preferred route for most network traffic
>   - Combines with encryption backdoor (time-based seed) for message interception
> - **Key Points**:
>   - Nodes don't see complete routing tables, only updates from neighbors
>   - Vulnerability exploits trust in routing protocol operation
>   - Difficult to detect without global network analysis
> - **Code Implementation**:
>   - Custom Node class with routing logic
>   - Network class to simulate routing behavior
>   - Malicious nodes generate updates with negative costs
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Subtle backdoor, not immediately obvious in code review
>   - Demonstrates understanding of networking and security concepts
>   - Realistic scenario of how routing vulnerabilities can be exploited
> - **Considerations**:
>   - Needs integration with chat system's networking code
>   - Provides opportunity for traffic interception and decryption attempts
