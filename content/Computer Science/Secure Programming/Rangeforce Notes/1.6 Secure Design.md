> [!idea] Security by Design
> Security by Design builds security into the software from the beginning.
> - Assumes attackers know system design
> - Relies on strength of security measures, not secrecy
> - Integrates security throughout development lifecycle
> - More cost-effective than retroactive security

> OWASP Security Design Principles:
> 
> | Principle | Description | Example |
> |-----------|-------------|---------|
> | Minimize attack surface area | Reduce software features that can be attacked | Remove unnecessary search functionality to eliminate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities |
> | Establish secure defaults | Set initial software settings to the most secure configuration | Enable password complexity and aging features by default |
> | Principle of least privilege | Grant users and processes only the permissions necessary for their tasks | A middleware server has access only to required network, database, and logging resources, without administrative privileges |
> | Principle of least common mechanism | Minimize shared access mechanisms to resources | Use separate authentication mechanisms for different user roles instead of a single shared mechanism |
> | Defense in depth | Implement multiple layers of security controls | Use input validation at each tier of a multi-tier application, plus network encryption and firewalls |
> | Fail securely | Ensure that system failures default to a secure state | Initialize an 'isAdmin' variable to false before attempting to verify admin status |
> | Don't trust services | Verify all transactions with external systems | Validate and sanitize data received from a third-party loyalty program before displaying it to users |
> | Separation of duties | Distribute critical tasks among multiple roles or individuals | Separate the roles for requesting, authorizing, and receiving equipment purchases |
> | Avoid security by obscurity | Don't rely solely on keeping design details secret | Use strong, well-known security measures instead of relying on hidden, proprietary algorithms |
> | Keep security simple | Prefer simpler security implementations to reduce errors | Eliminate a complex feature if a simpler, more secure alternative exists |
> | Fix security issues correctly | Address root causes and test thoroughly when fixing security problems | When fixing a data exposure bug, test the fix across all affected applications |

> [!consider] Balance Between Defense in Depth and Simplicity
> Balancing defense in depth with simplicity is crucial for effective security.
> 
> Defense in Depth:
> - Add appropriate security controls within each module
> - Focus on functionality and vulnerabilities of specific modules
> - Include external systems (OS, server software, runtime environment)
> - Design for quick response to security failures
> 
> Keeping Security Simple:
> - Avoid excessive complexity that violates the 'Keep security simple' principle
> - Too many layers can make code unmanageable and costly to maintain
> 
> Strategies for Balance:
> - Be strategic about defense layers
> - Ensure developers clearly understand module security controls
> - Implement automated unit tests for security controls
> - Reuse defensive code (e.g., input validation routines) when possible
> - Design system for easy shutdown of components to contain damage
> 
> Remember: The goal is to create a robust yet manageable security system that can withstand ongoing attacks without becoming overly complex.

> [!consider] Security through Obscurity
> Security through Obscurity attempts to **secure a system by keeping its mechanisms secret.**
> - May include tactics like obfuscating code or hiding system details
> - Can provide an extra layer of defense, but insufficient on its own
> - Risks:
>   - False sense of security
>   - Harder code maintenance
>   - Potentially more security issues due to complexity
>
>- "A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge."

> [!example] Security Design in Practice
> Implementing Security by Design:
> - Use well-known, tested encryption algorithms
> - Implement proper authentication and authorization
> - Follow principle of least privilege
> - Conduct regular security audits
> 
> Security through Obscurity example:
> - Obfuscating code by using meaningless variable names (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c')
> - While this may slow down manual code reading, it doesn't prevent automated analysis


> [!idea] Software and Secure Design Patterns
> Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software development problems.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Express problems, context, solutions, and structure
> - Save time and reduce mistakes in design and implementation
> - Often incorporated into development frameworks
> 
> Security patterns focus on:
> - Authentication
> - Authorization
> - Input validation
> - Session management
> - Monitoring and logging
> 
> Modular Design:
> - Separation of concerns: Divides tasks into smaller, manageable modules
> - Interfaces: Allow communication between modules
> - Encapsulation: Hides implementation details
> 
> Benefits of Modular Design:
> - Reduces errors leading to security problems
> - Protects against side effects
> - Facilitates reuse and maintainability
> - Allows focus on critical modules
> 
> Considerations:
> - Errors in reused modules can affect entire application
> - Integration of modules can introduce vulnerabilities
> - Importance of testing individual modules and integrated system
