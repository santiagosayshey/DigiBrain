> [!idea] Buffer Overflow
> A buffer overflow occurs when a program **writes data beyond the bounds of allocated memory**.
> - Caused by lack of bounds checking on input or buffer sizes
> - Can lead to crashes, data corruption, or code execution
> 
> Mitigation:
> - Use safe string functions (e.g., strncpy instead of strcpy)
> - Implement bounds checking
> - Enable compiler protections (e.g., stack canaries)
> - Use memory-safe languages or buffer overflow detection tools

> [!example] Buffer Overflow Example
> Vulnerable code:
> ```c
> char buffer[10];
> strcpy(buffer, "This string is too long");
> ```
> This code writes beyond the allocated 10 bytes, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
> 
> Secure version:
> ```c
> char buffer[10];
> snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "%s", "This string is too long");
> ```
> The secure version uses `snprintf`, which safely truncates the input to fit the buffer.

> [!idea] Over/Underread
> Over/underreads occur when a program **reads more or less data than expected**, often due to improper input handling or buffer management.
> 
> Overread:
> - Reads beyond the intended bounds of a buffer
> - Can lead to information disclosure or crashes
> 
> Underread:
> - Reads less data than expected, often due to premature termination of input
> - Can lead to incomplete data processing or unexpected behavior
> 
> Mitigation:
> - Implement proper bounds checking for all read operations
> - Use secure input functions that limit read sizes
> - Ensure complete data reads before processing
> - Implement robust error handling for I/O operations
> - Validate input sizes and types before processing

> [!example] Over/Underread Examples
> Overread example in C:
> ```c
> char buffer[10];
> int bytes_read = fread(buffer, 1, 20, file);  // Attempts to read more than buffer size
> ```
> This can read beyond the buffer's bounds, potentially accessing unintended memory.
> 
> Underread example in Python:
> ```python
> try:
>     data = file.read(100)  # Expects to read 100 bytes
>     process_data(data)
> except IOError:
>     pass  # Ignores read errors, potentially processing incomplete data
> ```
> If less than 100 bytes are available, this code might process incomplete data without proper error handling.
> 
> Secure approach:
> ```c
> char buffer[10];
> size_t bytes_to_read = sizeof(buffer);
> size_t bytes_read = fread(buffer, 1, bytes_to_read, file);
> if (bytes_read != bytes_to_read) {
>     // Handle incomplete read or error
> }
> ```
> This approach ensures the read operation doesn't exceed the buffer size and checks for complete reads.
