> 
> - **Address vulnerabilities from multiple angles:**
>   1. Software defects and misconfiguration
>   2. Human factors
>   3. Development and deployment process shortcomings
> 
> - **Understand the software problem lifecycle:**
>   - Error → Fault → Defect → Failure
>   - Earlier detection and correction is more cost-effective
> 
> - **Key prevention strategies:**
>   - Robust design and code review processes
>   - Regular security training for development teams
>   - Implementing secure coding practices
>   - Automated security testing throughout development
>   - Proper configuration management
>   - Continuous monitoring and rapid response to identified issues
> 
> | Problem Type | Description | Prevention Focus |
> |--------------|-------------|-------------------|
> | Error | A mistake made during software production (design, programming, installation, configuration) | Threat modeling, security requirements, training |
> | Fault | Manifestation of an error within code, leading to a security problem (bug) | Secure coding practices, code reviews |
> | Defect | Deviation from requirements resulting from a fault, causing functionality or quality issues | Security testing, vulnerability scanning |
> | Failure | Real-world problem occurring when a defect is released to customers | Monitoring, incident response, patching |
> 
> **Note:** Addressing vulnerabilities early in the development process is significantly more cost-effective than dealing with security failures post-release.

> [!idea] Preventing Vulnerabilities: Best Practices
> Key strategies to minimize security risks throughout the software development lifecycle and deployment.
> 
> | Area | Tips | Description |
> |------|------|-------------|
> | Design | Build security into processes | Understand requirements, document operations, identify environments and modules, list potential errors |
> | Coding | Prevent defects | Write efficient, readable code; follow secure coding standards; use static and dynamic analysis tools |
> | Third-Party Code | Careful selection and management | Vet thoroughly, research security history, test before integration, monitor for new vulnerabilities |
> | Dependencies | Manage and monitor | Be aware of all dependencies, including indirect ones; regularly check for vulnerabilities |
> | Encryption | Use validated libraries | Avoid developing custom encryption; select well-tested, community-validated libraries |
> | Host Systems & Services | Ensure provider security | Research and understand service provider security measures; implement additional protections as needed |
> | Configuration | Secure setup | Review all settings, remove unnecessary features, change default passwords, automate secure provisioning |
> | Virtual Machines | Protect VM infrastructure | Implement patch management, limit access, log activities, configure networking carefully, manage VM lifecycle |
> 
> **Key Principles:**
> - Address vulnerabilities early in the development process
> - Maintain awareness of all code and services used in your project
> - Regularly update and patch all components
> - Implement security at every layer: code, configuration, and infrastructure
