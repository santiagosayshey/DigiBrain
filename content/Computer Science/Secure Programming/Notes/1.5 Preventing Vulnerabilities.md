> [!idea] Preventing Vulnerabilities
> Implementing proactive strategies to minimize security risks throughout the software development lifecycle.
> 
> - **Address vulnerabilities from multiple angles:**
>   1. Software defects and misconfiguration
>   2. Human factors
>   3. Development and deployment process shortcomings
> 
> - **Understand the software problem lifecycle:**
>   - Error → Fault → Defect → Failure
>   - Earlier detection and correction is more cost-effective
> 
> - **Key prevention strategies:**
>   - Robust design and code review processes
>   - Regular security training for development teams
>   - Implementing secure coding practices
>   - Automated security testing throughout development
>   - Proper configuration management
>   - Continuous monitoring and rapid response to identified issues
> 
> | Problem Type | Description | Prevention Focus |
> |--------------|-------------|-------------------|
> | Error | A mistake made during software production (design, programming, installation, configuration) | Threat modeling, security requirements, training |
> | Fault | Manifestation of an error within code, leading to a security problem (bug) | Secure coding practices, code reviews |
> | Defect | Deviation from requirements resulting from a fault, causing functionality or quality issues | Security testing, vulnerability scanning |
> | Failure | Real-world problem occurring when a defect is released to customers | Monitoring, incident response, patching |
> 
> **Note:** Addressing vulnerabilities early in the development process is significantly more cost-effective than dealing with security failures post-release.
