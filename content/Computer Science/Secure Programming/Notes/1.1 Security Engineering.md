I'd be happy to fill out that table on "Security Engineering" based on the information provided in the first chapter of your textbook. Here's my attempt:

| Concept  | Description                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consider | Propose a scenario which sets the stage for a problem to arise. |
| Problem  | Explain the problem. Why is it bad? Why do we need to fix it?   |
| Solution | Propose a solution to said problem. How does it                 |
| Examples | - Banking systems (ATMs, online banking, high-value transfers)  |
           - Military bases (communications, electronic warfare, classified information)
           - Hospitals (patient safety, privacy of medical records)
           - Home security (car keys, utility meters, smart home devices) |
