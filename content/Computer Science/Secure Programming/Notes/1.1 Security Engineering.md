You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that unnecessary phrasing. You're correct that these should be straightforward notes without such attributions. Let me revise the table to reflect that:

| Concept  | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Consider | An organization needs to protect its systems, data, and operations against various threats, both internal and external. These systems could range from banking networks to military bases, hospitals, or home automation. |
| Problem  | Security challenges are complex and multifaceted. Many systems fail because their designers protect the wrong things, or protect the right things but in the wrong way. There's often a tension between security, functionality, and usability. Threats are constantly evolving, and what's secure today may not be tomorrow. |
| Solution | Security engineering provides a framework for addressing these challenges. It involves understanding and balancing four key elements: policy, mechanism, assurance, and incentives. It requires a holistic approach that considers not just technology, but also people, processes, and the broader context in which systems operate. |
| Examples | - Designing secure communication systems for military use
           - Implementing fraud detection in banking systems
           - Ensuring patient privacy in healthcare IT systems
           - Protecting smart home devices from unauthorized access
           - Securing critical infrastructure against cyber attacks |

Thank you for pointing this out. This version presents the information more directly as notes without unnecessary attributions.
