> [!idea] The Three Ps of Software Security
> Software security concerns can be categorized into three main areas:
> 
> 1. **Product**
>    - Common defects that harm security
>    - Insecure components and platforms
>    - Unsecure configuration of software and host systems
>    - Poorly implemented security policies
> 
> 2. **People**
>    - Operator errors
>    - Incorrect assumptions about software behavior
>    - Susceptibility to attacks
>    - Unintentional unsecure behavior
>    - Malicious behavior
> 
> 3. **Process**
>    - Lack of security integration throughout the development lifecycle
>    - Unsecure overall design
>    - Inadequate maintenance of software and deployments
>    - Development tools that don't promote security
> 
> Addressing these areas comprehensively can significantly improve software security.

> [!consider] Mitigating People-Related Security Issues
> 
> Developers can address people-related security problems through:
> 
> **Direct influence:**
> - Design user interfaces that prevent incorrect actions
> - Create clear, unambiguous user interfaces
> - Implement warning messages to guide users
> - Set secure default behaviors and configurations
> - Configure host system security policies
> 
> **Indirect influence:**
> - Collaborate with technical writers on clear end-user documentation
> - Work with training departments to ensure proper user training
> - Coordinate with system operators for secure host configurations
> - Negotiate with stakeholders to remove high-risk features
> 
> These strategies aim to mitigate security risks stemming from human factors in software use and management.


> [!idea] Expanded Common Security Terms and Definitions
> 
> | Term | Definition | Example |
> |------|------------|---------|
> | Asset | Item of value under the control of an information system | - User name and password<br>- Access to file storage service |
> | Vulnerability | Defect or weakness in a system that leaves it open to compromise | - Unencrypted sensitive information sent to web server<br>- Database without backup |
> | Threat | Possibility of an event that exploits a vulnerability, causing undesirable consequences | - Information disclosure<br>- Denial of service |
> | Threat Agent | Person, actor, organization, or disaster that initiates a threat | - Intelligence services<br>- Motivated criminal attackers<br>- Corporate spies<br>- Hacktivists |
> | Vector | Path or source through which a threat is delivered | - Email attachments with malicious code<br>- Social engineering<br>- Malicious web server |
> | Risk | Likelihood that a particular threat will materialize | - |
> | Risk Ranking | Often calculated as Probability × Impact, used to prioritize countermeasures | - Virus risk: 9 (probability) × 3 (impact) = 27 |
> | Exploit | Procedure or tool that facilitates a particular type of threat | - Published steps to extract sensitive user data<br>- Malware-installing script in email |
> | Consequence | Damage resulting from a carried-out threat | - Data loss, corruption, or leaks<br>- Loss of customers and revenue |
> | Countermeasure (Control) | Steps taken to reduce attack possibility or minimize harm | - Validating all untrusted inputs<br>- Configuring firewall to close unnecessary ports |
> 
> Note: Threats can be intentional, unintentional, or due to natural disasters. Not all threat agents are necessarily malicious.
