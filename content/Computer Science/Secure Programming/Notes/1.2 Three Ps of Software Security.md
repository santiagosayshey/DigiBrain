> [!idea] The Three Ps of Software Security
> Software security concerns can be categorized into three main areas:
> 
> 1. **Product**
>    - Common defects that harm security
>    - Insecure components and platforms
>    - Unsecure configuration of software and host systems
>    - Poorly implemented security policies
> 
> 2. **People**
>    - Operator errors
>    - Incorrect assumptions about software behavior
>    - Susceptibility to attacks
>    - Unintentional unsecure behavior
>    - Malicious behavior
> 
> 3. **Process**
>    - Lack of security integration throughout the development lifecycle
>    - Unsecure overall design
>    - Inadequate maintenance of software and deployments
>    - Development tools that don't promote security
> 
> Addressing these areas comprehensively can significantly improve software security.
