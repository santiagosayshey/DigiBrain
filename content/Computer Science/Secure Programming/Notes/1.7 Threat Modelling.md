> [!idea] Threat Modelling
> Threat modelling is a structured process to **identify, prioritise, and mitigate potential security threats** in software design.
> 
> The Threat Modelling Process:
> 
> 1. Define general security objectives and scope
>    - Collect existing project documentation and guidelines
>    - Gather predefined security requirements (e.g., compliance, project requirements)
> 
> 2. Decompose the software
>    - Break down the application into conceptual entry points, components, and boundaries
>    - Identify assets an attacker might target
>    - Determine access control for each area
>    - Diagram data flow through the application
> 
> 3. Identify and rank threats
>    - Think from an attacker's perspective
>    - Examine the application to identify potential threats
>    - Use tools like STRIDE and DREAD for threat identification and ranking
> 
> 4. Counter each threat
>    - Apply security design patterns for specific threat types
>    - Develop countermeasures for each identified threat
> 
> Considerations:
> - Adapt the process to your project's size, timeline, and resources
> - Focus on the most critical threats when faced with constraints
> - Regularly revisit and update the threat model throughout development
> 
> Tools and Techniques:
> - STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
> - DREAD: Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability
> - Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to visualize system components and interactions


> [!idea]+ The Risk Equation
> Risk is often considered as a product of three factors:
>
> | Component | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | Threat | Potential cause of an unwanted event |
> | Vulnerability | Weakness that can be exploited by a threat |
> | Consequences | Impact of a successful attack (technical and business) |
>
> Risk = Threat \* Vulnerability \* Consequences
>
> Consequences may include:
> - Technical impacts:
>   - Denial of Service (DoS)
>   - Data compromise or loss
> - Business impacts:
>   - Customer dissatisfaction
>   - Damaged business relationships
>   - Unplanned expenses
>   - Loss of shareholder confidence
