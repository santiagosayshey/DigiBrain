> [!idea] Threat Modeling
> Threat modeling is a structured process to **identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential security threats** in software design.
>
> Key aspects:
> - Systematically identifies threats
> - Prioritizes threat handling
> - Guides design of countermeasures



> [!idea]+ The Risk Equation
> Risk is often considered as a product of three factors:
>
> | Component | Description |
> |-----------|-------------|
> | Threat | Potential cause of an unwanted event |
> | Vulnerability | Weakness that can be exploited by a threat |
> | Consequences | Impact of a successful attack (technical and business) |
>
> Risk = Threat \* Vulnerability * Consequences
>
> Consequences may include:
> - Technical impacts:
>   - Denial of Service (DoS)
>   - Data compromise or loss
> - Business impacts:
>   - Customer dissatisfaction
>   - Damaged business relationships
>   - Unplanned expenses
>   - Loss of shareholder confidence
>
> Threat Modeling Process:
> 1. Identify assets
> 2. Create an architecture overview
> 3. Decompose the application
> 4. Identify threats
> 5. Document threats
> 6. Rate threats
>
> Benefits:
> - Provides a systematic approach to security
> - Helps prioritize security efforts
> - Guides design decisions for effective countermeasures
> - Facilitates communication about security risks within the team
