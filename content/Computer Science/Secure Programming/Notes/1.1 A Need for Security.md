> [!idea]+ Constant Security
> Security should be integrated into entire software development lifecycle, starting at the beginning of the development process.
>   1. Identify security requirements during planning phase
  2. Design and develop security features into product
>  3. Test to verify security requirements are met
>  4. Monitor and update security post-deployment
>
>Dealing with issues in later stages of development is more expensive than dealing with them at the start.


> [!idea]+ Business Requirements and Security
> Business requirements define **what** software should accomplish, not **how**.
> 
> 1. Corporate setting:
>    - Structured plan by development team and stakeholders
>    - Should identify security considerations, regulations, and standards
>    - Conformance to standards verified in finished product
> 
> 2. Solo app developer:
>    - May start with simple idea (e.g., napkin sketch)
>    - Should still analyze and document requirements
> 
> 3. Consumer app development:
>    - Process differs from custom business apps
>    - Developer should integrate security throughout development
> 
> 4. Custom business applications:
>    - Security driven by user expectations, standards, and regulations
>    - Internal needs (trade secrets, customer data) also drive security
>    - Business stakeholders crucial in establishing requirements
> 
> Thorough business requirements benefit the entire organization, regardless of development context.
