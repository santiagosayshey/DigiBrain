> [!idea]+ Constant Security
> Security should be integrated into entire software development lifecycle, starting at the beginning of the development process.
>   1. Identify security requirements during planning phase
  2. Design and develop security features into product
>  3. Test to verify security requirements are met
>  4. Monitor and update security post-deployment
>
>Dealing with issues in later stages of development is more expensive than dealing with them at the start.


> [!idea]+ Business Requirements and Security
> Business requirements define **what** software should accomplish, not **how**.
> 
> 1. Corporate setting:
>    - Structured plan by development team and stakeholders
>    - Should identify security considerations, regulations, and standards
>    - Conformance to standards verified in finished product
> 
> 2. Solo app developer:
>    - May start with simple idea (e.g., napkin sketch)
>    - Should still analyze and document requirements
> 
> 3. Consumer app development:
>    - Process differs from custom business apps
>    - Developer should integrate security throughout development
> 
> 4. Custom business applications:
>    - Security driven by user expectations, standards, and regulations
>    - Internal needs (trade secrets, customer data) also drive security
>    - Business stakeholders crucial in establishing requirements
> 
> 5. Regulatory compliance:
>    - Various regulations define specific business requirements for apps
>    - These may vary by industry, region, or app type
>    - Example: Australia's Privacy Act requires apps to have a clear, up-to-date privacy policy accessible to users
> 
> Thorough business requirements benefit the entire organization, regardless of development context.


> [!idea]+ Key Industry Standards in IT Security
> Industry standards provide frameworks for implementing robust IT security practices. Two significant standards are:
> 
> 1. **ISO/IEC 27000 (ISMS)**:
>    - Joint standard by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
>    - Provides a comprehensive framework for information security management
>    - Helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their information security
>    - Includes guidelines for risk assessment, security controls, and management review
> 
> 2. **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
>    - Focused on securing credit card transactions and protecting cardholder data
>    - Defines 12 high-level requirements organized into 6 control objectives
>    - Includes over 300 specific standards for handling payment information
>    - Particularly relevant for developers of payment applications and e-commerce platforms
>    - Compliance can be simplified by using third-party e-commerce service providers
> 
> These standards help organizations ensure comprehensive security measures and comply with industry best practices.

Certainly. Here's an idea callout focusing on user expectations and impact:

> [!idea]+ User Expectations and Security Impact
> Software security significantly affects users, both directly and indirectly. Key points include:
>
> 1. User Expectations:
>    - Reasonable protection of privacy, security, confidentiality, and safety
>    - Secure operation without exposing users to problems
>    - Protection of sensitive information when required
>    - User interfaces that encourage secure practices (e.g., complex passwords, regular backups)
>
> 2. Security Impact on Users:
>    - Direct impact through user-facing software (e.g., operating systems, applications)
>    - Indirect impact through backend systems (e.g., databases, web services, industrial control systems)
>    - Potential for wide-ranging consequences, even from seemingly unrelated software (e.g., utility control systems)
>
> 3. User Knowledge and Behavior:
>    - Varying levels of security awareness among users
>    - Need for software to protect users from potential security errors
>    - Importance of designing intuitive security features
>
> 4. Trust Relationship:
>    - Users extend trust when providing sensitive information
>    - Positive experiences lead to good ratings and continued use
>    - Negative experiences can severely damage app reputation and adoption
>
> 5. Developer Responsibilities:
>    - Understand the platform and its vulnerabilities
>    - Develop software that actively protects users
>    - Balance security measures with user experience
>
> Meeting these expectations requires a comprehensive approach to security throughout the software development lifecycle.
