> [!idea] Security by Design
> Security by Design builds security into the software from the beginning.
> - Assumes attackers know system design
> - Relies on strength of security measures, not secrecy
> - Integrates security throughout development lifecycle
> - More cost-effective than retroactive security
> 
> OWASP Security Design Principles:
> 1. Minimize attack surface area
> 2. Establish secure defaults
> 3. Principle of least privilege
> 4. Principle of least common mechanism
> 5. Defense in depth
> 6. Fail securely
> 7. Don't trust services
> 8. Separation of duties
> 9. Avoid security by obscurity
> 10. Keep security simple
> 11. Fix security issues correctly
> 
> These principles provide a framework for designing secure software and addressing common vulnerabilities.

> [!consider] Security through Obscurity
> Security through Obscurity attempts to **secure a system by keeping its mechanisms secret.**
> - May include tactics like obfuscating code or hiding system details
> - Can provide an extra layer of defense, but insufficient on its own
> - Risks:
>   - False sense of security
>   - Harder code maintenance
>   - Potentially more security issues due to complexity
>
>- "A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge."

> [!example] Security Design in Practice
> Implementing Security by Design:
> - Use well-known, tested encryption algorithms
> - Implement proper authentication and authorization
> - Follow principle of least privilege
> - Conduct regular security audits
> 
> Security through Obscurity example:
> - Obfuscating code by using meaningless variable names (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c')
> - While this may slow down manual code reading, it doesn't prevent automated analysis
