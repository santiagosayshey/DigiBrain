> [!idea] Builders and Breakers in Software Development
> 
> **Builders (Software Developers)**
> - Start with a concept or blueprint
> - Gather resources (compiler, libraries, components, patterns, algorithms)
> - Plan and execute construction strategy
> - Create new software
> 
> **Breakers (Attackers)**
> - Start with an attack target
> - Gather information through research and probing
> - Plan exploitation strategy
> - Launch attacks
> 
> **Key Differences**
> - Builders construct software; Breakers deconstruct it
> 
> **Similarities in Approach**
> Both rely on:
> - Knowledge (of languages, APIs, SDKs, tools)
> - Skills (specific to building or breaking)
> - Experience (using tools, strategies, tactics)
> 
> **Developer Mindset Shift**
> - Alternating between builder and breaker mindsets can improve security
> - "Thinking like an attacker" means focusing on ways to break application security
> - This approach helps anticipate and correct security issues before release


> [!idea] Hacking and Types of Hackers
> 
> **Hacking**: The act of breaking software security
> 
> **Hacker**: An individual who engages in hacking
> 
> Types of hackers based on motives:
> 
> 1. **White Hat Hackers**
>    - Primarily benevolent purposes
>    - Engage in security research
>    - Aim to improve software security
> 
> 2. **Black Hat Hackers**
>    - Criminal purposes
>    - Motivations include:
>      - Extortion
>      - Theft
>      - Cyber terrorism
> 
> 3. **Gray Hat Hackers**
>    - Don't fit clearly into white or black hat categories
>    - May be motivated by profit
>    - Might sell uncovered information to government agencies
>    - Can be free agents or defense contractors
> 
> Note: The classification of hackers helps understand different motivations and potential impacts of hacking activities on software security.


> [!idea] Phases of a Cyber Attack
> 
> Cyber attacks often follow a methodical, planned process:
> 
> 1. **Survey and Assess**
>    - Scout the target, learn about technologies and configurations
>    - Identify the attack surface
>    - Avoid triggering alarms
> 
> 2. **Exploit and Penetrate**
>    - Take advantage of vulnerabilities
>    - More invasive than the first phase
> 
> 3. **Escalate Privileges**
>    - Gain higher access privileges (admin, system, or root account)
> 
> 4. **Maintain Access**
>    - Set up for long-term access
>    - Cover tracks (hide tools, remove log entries)
> 
> 5. **Deny Service** (optional)
>    - Launch attacks that disrupt or destroy system functionality
> 
> Note: These phases often occur in repetitive cycles as attackers gain access to new parts of the system.


> [!consider] Common Attack Patterns
> 
> | Attack Type | Description | Examples |
> |-------------|-------------|----------|
> | Reconnaissance | Gather information about the target | Active scanning, passive information gathering |
> | Reverse Engineering | Analyze structure and function of a system | Decompiling software, analyzing network protocols |
> | Functionality Misuse | Use application features in unintended ways | Overuse of features, leveraging defective functionality |
> | Gain Access Privileges | Obtain unauthorized access | Brute force attacks, authentication abuse, authentication bypass |
> | Identity Spoofing | Impersonate another entity | Message spoofing, credential theft |
> | Memory Manipulation | Manipulate memory to undermine security | Buffer manipulation, pointer manipulation |
> | Parameter Injection | Modify request parameters | HTTP parameter manipulation, SQL injection |
> | Input Data Manipulation | Supply data in unorthodox forms | Character encoding tricks, file extension spoofing |
> | Action Spoofing | Disguise one action as another | Clickjacking |
> | Software Integrity Attack | Compromise integrity of software or data | Modifying code or data structures |
> | Malicious Code Injection | Insert attacker's code into application | Code inclusion, code injection, command injection, content spoofing |
> | Denial of Service | Prevent legitimate use of the system | Excessive allocation, flooding, resource leaks, sustained client engagement |
> | Repudiation | Conduct transactions without leaving proof | Log manipulation, transaction spoofing |
> 
> Note: Attackers may use multiple attack patterns in combination or sequence to achieve their goals.


> [!example] Password Security: Builder vs. Breaker Mindset
> 
> | Aspect | Builder (Developer) Approach | Breaker (Attacker) Approach |
> |--------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
> | Password Storage | Store hashed passwords with unique salts | Attempt to access and decrypt/crack stored passwords |
> | Brute Force Prevention | Implement login attempt limits and delays | Use automated tools to guess passwords systematically |
> | Database Protection | Encrypt sensitive data, limit access | Attempt to bypass encryption or exploit vulnerabilities to access raw data |
> | Password Hashing | Use strong, one-way hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) | Create rainbow tables or use GPU-accelerated cracking tools |
> | Salt Usage | Generate unique salts for each password | Attempt to discover salt generation method or exploit weak salts |
> | Login Process | Implement secure comparison methods | Exploit timing attacks or side-channel vulnerabilities |
> | User Education | Encourage strong, unique passwords | Exploit common user behaviors (e.g., password reuse, simple patterns) |
> | System Design | Implement principle of least privilege | Look for overlooked access points or privilege escalation opportunities |
> 
> **Key Takeaways:**
> - Builders focus on implementing layers of security to protect user credentials.
> - Breakers continuously seek vulnerabilities in each layer of protection.
> - The security process is ongoing, with both sides adapting to new techniques and technologies.
> - A comprehensive approach considering both perspectives can lead to more robust security measures.
