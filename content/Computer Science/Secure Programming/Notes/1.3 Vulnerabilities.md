> [!idea] Builders and Breakers in Software Development
> 
> **Builders (Software Developers)**
> - Start with a concept or blueprint
> - Gather resources (compiler, libraries, components, patterns, algorithms)
> - Plan and execute construction strategy
> - Create new software
> 
> **Breakers (Attackers)**
> - Start with an attack target
> - Gather information through research and probing
> - Plan exploitation strategy
> - Launch attacks
> 
> **Key Differences**
> - Builders construct software; Breakers deconstruct it
> 
> **Similarities in Approach**
> Both rely on:
> - Knowledge (of languages, APIs, SDKs, tools)
> - Skills (specific to building or breaking)
> - Experience (using tools, strategies, tactics)
> 
> **Developer Mindset Shift**
> - Alternating between builder and breaker mindsets can improve security
> - "Thinking like an attacker" means focusing on ways to break application security
> - This approach helps anticipate and correct security issues before release


> [!idea] Hacking and Types of Hackers
> 
> **Hacking**: The act of breaking software security
> 
> **Hacker**: An individual who engages in hacking
> 
> Types of hackers based on motives:
> 
> 1. **White Hat Hackers**
>    - Primarily benevolent purposes
>    - Engage in security research
>    - Aim to improve software security
> 
> 2. **Black Hat Hackers**
>    - Criminal purposes
>    - Motivations include:
>      - Extortion
>      - Theft
>      - Cyber terrorism
> 
> 3. **Gray Hat Hackers**
>    - Don't fit clearly into white or black hat categories
>    - May be motivated by profit
>    - Might sell uncovered information to government agencies
>    - Can be free agents or defense contractors
> 
> Note: The classification of hackers helps understand different motivations and potential impacts of hacking activities on software security.
