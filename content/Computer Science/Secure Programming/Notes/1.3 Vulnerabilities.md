> [!idea] Builders and Breakers in Software Development
> 
> **Builders (Software Developers)**
> - Start with a concept or blueprint
> - Gather resources (compiler, libraries, components, patterns, algorithms)
> - Plan and execute construction strategy
> - Create new software
> 
> **Breakers (Attackers)**
> - Start with an attack target
> - Gather information through research and probing
> - Plan exploitation strategy
> - Launch attacks
> 
> **Key Differences**
> - Builders construct software; Breakers deconstruct it
> 
> **Similarities in Approach**
> Both rely on:
> - Knowledge (of languages, APIs, SDKs, tools)
> - Skills (specific to building or breaking)
> - Experience (using tools, strategies, tactics)
> 
> **Developer Mindset Shift**
> - Alternating between builder and breaker mindsets can improve security
> - "Thinking like an attacker" means focusing on ways to break application security
> - This approach helps anticipate and correct security issues before release


> [!idea] Hacking and Types of Hackers
> 
> **Hacking**: The act of breaking software security
> 
> **Hacker**: An individual who engages in hacking
> 
> Types of hackers based on motives:
> 
> 1. **White Hat Hackers**
>    - Primarily benevolent purposes
>    - Engage in security research
>    - Aim to improve software security
> 
> 2. **Black Hat Hackers**
>    - Criminal purposes
>    - Motivations include:
>      - Extortion
>      - Theft
>      - Cyber terrorism
> 
> 3. **Gray Hat Hackers**
>    - Don't fit clearly into white or black hat categories
>    - May be motivated by profit
>    - Might sell uncovered information to government agencies
>    - Can be free agents or defense contractors
> 
> Note: The classification of hackers helps understand different motivations and potential impacts of hacking activities on software security.


> [!idea] Phases of a Cyber Attack
> 
> Cyber attacks often follow a methodical, planned process:
> 
> 1. **Survey and Assess**
>    - Scout the target, learn about technologies and configurations
>    - Identify the attack surface
>    - Avoid triggering alarms
> 
> 2. **Exploit and Penetrate**
>    - Take advantage of vulnerabilities
>    - More invasive than the first phase
> 
> 3. **Escalate Privileges**
>    - Gain higher access privileges (admin, system, or root account)
> 
> 4. **Maintain Access**
>    - Set up for long-term access
>    - Cover tracks (hide tools, remove log entries)
> 
> 5. **Deny Service** (optional)
>    - Launch attacks that disrupt or destroy system functionality
> 
> Note: These phases often occur in repetitive cycles as attackers gain access to new parts of the system.


> [!consider] Common Attack Patterns
> 
> | Attack Type | Description | Examples |
> |-------------|-------------|----------|
> | Reconnaissance | Gather information about the target | Active scanning, passive information gathering |
> | Reverse Engineering | Analyze structure and function of a system | Decompiling software, analyzing network protocols |
> | Functionality Misuse | Use application features in unintended ways | Overuse of features, leveraging defective functionality |
> | Gain Access Privileges | Obtain unauthorized access | Brute force attacks, authentication abuse, authentication bypass |
> | Identity Spoofing | Impersonate another entity | Message spoofing, credential theft |
> | Memory Manipulation | Manipulate memory to undermine security | Buffer manipulation, pointer manipulation |
> | Parameter Injection | Modify request parameters | HTTP parameter manipulation, SQL injection |
> | Input Data Manipulation | Supply data in unorthodox forms | Character encoding tricks, file extension spoofing |
> | Action Spoofing | Disguise one action as another | Clickjacking |
> | Software Integrity Attack | Compromise integrity of software or data | Modifying code or data structures |
> | Malicious Code Injection | Insert attacker's code into application | Code inclusion, code injection, command injection, content spoofing |
> | Denial of Service | Prevent legitimate use of the system | Excessive allocation, flooding, resource leaks, sustained client engagement |
> | Repudiation | Conduct transactions without leaving proof | Log manipulation, transaction spoofing |
> 
> Note: Attackers may use multiple attack patterns in combination or sequence to achieve their goals.


> [!example] Password Security: Builder vs. Breaker Mindset
> 
> | Step | Builder (Developer) Approach | Breaker (Attacker) Approach |
> |------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
> | Initial Implementation | Require username and password for registration and login | Attempt to guess passwords through brute force |
> | Basic Protection | Store passwords in a database | Try to access the database to steal passwords |
> | Thwarting Brute Force | Implement login delays, account lockouts, and logging | Develop more sophisticated brute force methods, potentially using distributed attacks |
> | Database Protection | Encrypt passwords in the database | Attempt to bypass encryption or exploit application vulnerabilities to decrypt passwords |
> | Password Hashing | Implement one-way hashing for password storage | Create rainbow tables to match hashes to common passwords |
> | Salting | Add unique salts to passwords before hashing | Attempt to discover salt generation method or exploit weak salts |
> | Advanced Protection | Consider additional measures like pepper | Look for weaknesses in implementation or storage of additional security measures |
> 
> **Key Observations:**
> - Each security measure implemented by builders is met with a corresponding attempt to circumvent by breakers.
> - The security process is iterative, with both sides continuously adapting their approaches.
> - Builders must anticipate potential attack vectors at each stage of implementation.
> - A layered approach to security, considering both builder and breaker perspectives, results in more robust protection.


> [!consider] Integrating Builder and Breaker Mindsets
> 
> - **Design**: Include use and misuse cases, early threat modeling
> - **Development**: Alternate building and breaking passes
>   1. Design module
>   2. Identify potential attacks
>   3. Implement countermeasures
>   4. Repeat until secure
> - **Maintenance**: Regular security reassessments post-deployment
> - **Learning**: Stay updated on emerging attack patterns
> 
> Key: Involve dedicated security experts when possible and apply this mindset throughout the entire software lifecycle.

> [!idea] The Human Element in Software Security
> Recognizing and mitigating vulnerabilities introduced by human behavior and interactions.
> 
> - **Key Considerations:**
>   - Well-intentioned users can introduce risks unknowingly
>   - Malicious actors exploit human tendencies through social engineering
>   - User input is a significant vector for security vulnerabilities
> 
> | Category | Examples | Mitigation Strategies |
> |----------|----------|------------------------|
> | User Behaviors | - Weak passwords<br>- Unsecured file storage<br>- Disabling security features | - Enforce strong password policies<br>- Implement access controls<br>- User education and training |
> | Social Engineering | - Phishing<br>- Tailgating<br>- Baiting | - Security awareness training<br>- Multi-factor authentication<br>- Physical security measures |
> | User Input Risks | - Buffer overflows<br>- SQL injection<br>- Cross-site scripting | - Input validation<br>- Parameterized queries<br>- Output encoding |
> 
> **Key Principles:**
> - Design with user behavior in mind
> - Implement technical controls to limit potential damage
> - Provide ongoing user education and awareness training
> - Monitor and report suspicious activities
> - Balance security measures with usability
> 
> **Note:** While you can't completely control user behavior, a combination of technical controls, education, and monitoring can significantly reduce human-related security risks.
