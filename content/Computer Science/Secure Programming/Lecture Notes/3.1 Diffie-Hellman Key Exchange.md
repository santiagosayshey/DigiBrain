> [!motivation] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
> It's very difficult to securely exchange keys amongst an increasing number of people. The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange method allows two parties to generate a shared secret over an insecure channel. This process ensures that an interceptor, despite seeing the exchanged public components (mixed colors), cannot derive the shared secret due to the absence of private components. This clever approach facilitates secure communication in a world where true privacy is increasingly challenging.
