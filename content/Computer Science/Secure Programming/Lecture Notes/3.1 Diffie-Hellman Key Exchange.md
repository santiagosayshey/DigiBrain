> [!motivation] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
> It's very difficult to securely exchange keys amongst an increasing number of people. The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange method allows two parties to generate a shared secret over an insecure channel. This process ensures that an interceptor, despite seeing the exchanged public components (mixed colors), cannot derive the shared secret due to the absence of private components. This clever approach facilitates secure communication in a world where true privacy is increasingly challenging.

> | 1    | Starts with a base color **Yellow**.                                                      | Yellow is visible                                         |
> | 2    | Alice chooses a private color **Blue**. Mixes with **Yellow** to get **Green**.           | Blue is invisible                                         |
> | 3    | Bob chooses a private color **Red**. Mixes with **Yellow** to get **Orange**.             | Red is invisible                                          |
> | 4    | Alice sends **Green** to Bob, and Bob sends **Orange** to Alice.                          | Green and Orange are visible                              |
> | 5    | Mixes received **Orange** with her private **Blue** to create **Purple** (shared secret). | Purple is invisible because private colours are invisible |
> | 6    | Mixes received **Green** with his private **Red** to create **Purple** (shared secret).   | Purple is invisible because private colours are invisible |


> [!example] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in Action
> The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in practice uses mathematical functions instead of colors. Here's how it translates:
> - **Public Base Number $(g)$ and Prime Number $(p)$**: Alice and Bob agree on a public base number $g = 5$ and a public prime number $p = 23$.
> - **Private Numbers $(a \text{ and } b)$**: Alice selects a private number $a = 6$, and Bob selects a private number $b = 15$.
> - **Computing Public Values**: 
>   - Alice computes $A = g^a \mod p$
>     - $A = 5^6 \mod 23$
>     - $A = 15625 \mod 23$
>     - $A = 8$
>   - Bob computes $B = g^b \mod p$
>     - $B = 5^{15} \mod 23$
>     - $B = 30517578125 \mod 23$
>     - $B = 19$
> - **Exchanging Public Values**: Alice sends $A = 8$ to Bob and Bob sends $B = 19$ to Alice over the public channel.
> - **Computing Shared Secret**: 
>   - Alice computes the shared secret as $s_A = B^a \mod p$
>     - $s_A = 19^6 \mod 23$
>     - $s_A = 47045881 \mod 23$
>     - $s_A = 2$
>   - Bob computes the shared secret as $s_B = A^b \mod p$
>     - $s_B = 8^{15} \mod 23$
>     - $s_B = 35184372088832 \mod 23$
>     - $s_B = 2$
> 
> Both $s_A$ and $s_B$ result in the same shared secret number $s = 2$.
