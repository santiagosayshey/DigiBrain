> [!motivation] Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
> It's very difficult to securely exchange keys amongst an increasing number of people. The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange method allows two parties to generate a shared secret over an insecure channel. This process ensures that an interceptor, despite seeing the exchanged public components (mixed colors), cannot derive the shared secret due to the absence of private components. This clever approach facilitates secure communication in a world where true privacy is increasingly challenging.

> | 1    | Starts with a base color **Yellow**.                                                      | Yellow is visible                                         |
> | 2    | Alice chooses a private color **Blue**. Mixes with **Yellow** to get **Green**.           | Blue is invisible                                         |
> | 3    | Bob chooses a private color **Red**. Mixes with **Yellow** to get **Orange**.             | Red is invisible                                          |
> | 4    | Alice sends **Green** to Bob, and Bob sends **Orange** to Alice.                          | Green and Orange are visible                              |
> | 5    | Mixes received **Orange** with her private **Blue** to create **Purple** (shared secret). | Purple is invisible because private colours are invisible |
> | 6    | Mixes received **Green** with his private **Red** to create **Purple** (shared secret).   | Purple is invisible because private colours are invisible |


> [!consider] Turning Colors into Math
> The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in practice uses mathematical functions instead of colors. Here's how it translates:
> - **Public Base Color (Yellow)** becomes a public base number $g$ and a public prime number $p$.
> - **Private Colors (Blue and Red)** represent private numbers selected by Alice and Bob, respectively $a$ and $b$.
> - **Mixing Colors** equates to raising the base number $g$ to the power of their private numbers $a$ or $b$ modulo the prime number $p$: $g^a \mod p$ and $g^b \mod p$.
> - **Exchanging Mixed Colors (Green and Orange)** corresponds to sharing these results over the public channel.
> - **Final Mixing to Get the Shared Secret (Purple)** is analogous to each party raising the received value to the power of their private number modulo $p$: $(g^b)^a \mod p = (g^a)^b \mod p$, which results in a shared secret number.
