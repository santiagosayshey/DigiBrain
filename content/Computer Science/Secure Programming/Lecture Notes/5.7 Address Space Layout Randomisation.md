motivation - the exploits we've seen - buffer overflow, return to libc, ROP, etc rely on the fact that we have precise address for things everywhere. Well, what if we didn't?

idea - Address Space Layout Randomisation
- essentially, randomise our address space
- we understand that in x86, we have a nick stack that grows downwards and heap upwards, and data / code below the heap.
	- but in reality, there is often lots of fragmentation and unused space between everything (mostly empty)
- well, since it's mostly empty, why don't we just move things around? what if the heap existed at the top? the stack at the bottom? the data and code in the middle?
	- Randomise this every time the program is run
- this solves buffer overflow, libc, ROP, etc
- show an example of cat /proc/self/maps | egrep '(lib|heap|stack)' twice and say that the adddresses change every time

example
- show what this means by drawing some stacks in a code block. show that each runtime, we can't properly find an address of something (shellcode) because of ASLR

consider - more technical knowledge on how aslr is actually done.
