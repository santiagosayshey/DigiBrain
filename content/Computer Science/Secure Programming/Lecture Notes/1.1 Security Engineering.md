> [!motivation] The Critical Need for Security Engineering
> In our increasingly digital world, **software vulnerabilities pose significant risks**:
> 
> - Widespread Impact:
>   - **Software runs critical infrastructure, financial systems, and medical devices**
>   - Vulnerabilities can affect millions of users globally
> 
> - Evolving Threat Landscape:
>   - **Cyber attacks grow in sophistication and frequency**
>   - New technologies introduce novel attack vectors
> 
> - High Stakes:
>   - Financial losses: **Data breaches cost companies millions**
>   - Human cost: **Software errors can lead to injury or death**
>   - Reputational damage: Security incidents erode public trust
> 
> Real-world cases illustrate these risks:
> 1. Therac-25 incident (1985-1987):
>    - **Medical software bug caused radiation overdoses, resulting in patient deaths**
> 
> 2. Equifax data breach (2017):
>    - **Exploit of a single vulnerability led to exposure of 147 million consumers' data**
> 
> **Both unintentional errors and malicious attacks pose significant threats** to software systems. The impact of security breaches extends beyond immediate financial losses, emphasizing that **proactive security measures are essential in modern software development**.



> [!example] OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks with Real-World Examples
> The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) regularly publishes a **list of the most critical security risks to web applications**. Here's the OWASP Top 10 for 2021 with real-world examples:
>
> | Rank | Vulnerability | Description | Real-World Example |
> |------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
> | 1 | Broken Access Control | Failures in restricting authenticated users from accessing unauthorized functions or data | 2018 Facebook breach: Attackers exploited vulnerabilities to steal access tokens of 50 million users |
> | 2 | Cryptographic Failures | Weaknesses in encryption, often leading to exposure of sensitive data | 2017 Equifax breach: Unencrypted data of 147 million customers exposed due to failure to renew an encryption certificate |
> | 3 | Injection | Insertion of untrusted data into application queries or commands | 2014 TweetDeck XSS vulnerability: A tweet containing JavaScript code exploited a cross-site scripting vulnerability in TweetDeck, causing automatic retweets and potential account hijacking |
> | 4 | Insecure Design | Lack of threat modeling and secure design patterns in the development process | 2021 Twitch data leak: A server configuration change exposed Twitch's source code and user payout information |
> | 5 | Security Misconfiguration | Improper implementation of security controls in the application, framework, or infrastructure | 2019 Capital One breach: A misconfigured web application firewall allowed access to over 100 million customer records |
> | 6 | Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Use of components with known vulnerabilities or lack of security updates | 2017 Equifax breach: Attackers exploited a known vulnerability in an outdated version of Apache Struts |
> | 7 | Identification and Authentication Failures | Incorrect implementation of authentication and session management | 2012 Dropbox breach: Reused passwords led to the theft of 68 million user credentials |
> | 8 | Software and Data Integrity Failures | Lack of integrity checks on software updates, critical data, or CI/CD pipelines | 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack: Compromised software updates allowed attackers to access numerous high-profile targets |
> | 9 | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response to security incidents | 2014 Yahoo data breach: Took two years to detect, affecting 3 billion user accounts |
> | 10 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Fetching remote resources without validating the user-supplied URL | 2019 Capital One breach: SSRF vulnerability allowed an attacker to retrieve data from AWS metadata service |
>
> These real-world examples demonstrate the severe consequences of these vulnerabilities and underscore the importance of addressing them in software development.

> [!idea] Security Engineering: A Comprehensive Approach
> Security engineering addresses these challenges by:
> - Implementing **secure coding** practices throughout the development process
> - Conducting thorough and regular **vulnerability assessments**
> - Designing systems with **security as a fundamental** principle, not an afterthought
> - Continuously **updating and patching** software to address new threats
> 
> By prioritizing security throughout the software development lifecycle, we can mitigate risks and build more resilient systems.

> [!idea] Who Is The Opponent?
> The cybersecurity landscape includes a diverse range of actors with varying intentions and impacts:
> 
> | Actor Type | Who | What | Why | Impact |
> |------------|-----|------|-----|--------|
> | Nation-state Actors (APTs) | Government-sponsored hacking groups | Sophisticated, persistent attacks | Espionage, sabotage, political gain | Negative: compromising national security, economic damage |
> | Cybercriminals | Organized crime groups, individual hackers | Ransomware, data theft, fraud | Financial gain | Negative: economic loss, privacy violations |
> | Hacktivists | Politically motivated individuals or groups | DDoS attacks, website defacement | Ideology, social or political change | Mixed: exposing injustices but potentially causing harm |
> | Insider Threats | Employees, contractors | Data leaks, sabotage | Revenge, financial gain, negligence | Negative: internal security breaches |
> | Script Kiddies | Novice hackers, students | Use of pre-made tools, basic attacks | Learning, thrill-seeking, reputation | Mixed: potential for both harm and learning |
> | Corporate Spies | Competing companies | Industrial espionage | Competitive advantage, trade secrets | Negative: economic damage, unfair competition |
> | Ethical Hackers | Security researchers, bug bounty hunters | Vulnerability discovery, penetration testing | Improve security, recognition, rewards | Positive: strengthening systems, responsible disclosure |
> | Cybersecurity Firms | Private companies | Security products, threat intelligence | Business, enhancing overall security | Positive: developing defenses, sharing knowledge |
> | Academic Researchers | Universities, research institutions | Security analysis, tool development | Advancing knowledge, improving security | Positive: innovation, education |
> | Open Source Community | Developers, enthusiasts | Creating/maintaining security tools | Collaboration, accessibility | Positive: free tools, shared expertise |
>
> Understanding this ecosystem helps in developing comprehensive security strategies that leverage allies and defend against adversaries.
