> [!motivation] The Critical Need for Security Engineering
> In our increasingly digital world, **software vulnerabilities pose significant risks**:
> 
> - Widespread Impact:
>   - **Software runs critical infrastructure, financial systems, and medical devices**
>   - Vulnerabilities can affect millions of users globally
> 
> - Evolving Threat Landscape:
>   - **Cyber attacks grow in sophistication and frequency**
>   - New technologies introduce novel attack vectors
> 
> - High Stakes:
>   - Financial losses: **Data breaches cost companies millions**
>   - Human cost: **Software errors can lead to injury or death**
>   - Reputational damage: Security incidents erode public trust
> 
> Real-world cases illustrate these risks:
> 1. Therac-25 incident (1985-1987):
>    - **Medical software bug caused radiation overdoses, resulting in patient deaths**
> 
> 2. Equifax data breach (2017):
>    - **Exploit of a single vulnerability led to exposure of 147 million consumers' data**
> 
> **Both unintentional errors and malicious attacks pose significant threats** to software systems. The impact of security breaches extends beyond immediate financial losses, emphasizing that **proactive security measures are essential in modern software development**.

> [!example] OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
> The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) regularly publishes a **list of the most critical security risks to web applications**. Here's the OWASP Top 10 for 2021:
>
> | Rank | Vulnerability | Description |
> |------|---------------|-------------|
> | 1 | Broken Access Control | Failures in restricting authenticated users from accessing unauthorized functions or data |
> | 2 | Cryptographic Failures | Weaknesses in encryption, often leading to exposure of sensitive data |
> | 3 | Injection | Insertion of untrusted data into application queries or commands |
> | 4 | Insecure Design | Lack of threat modeling and secure design patterns in the development process |
> | 5 | Security Misconfiguration | Improper implementation of security controls in the application, framework, or infrastructure |
> | 6 | Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Use of components with known vulnerabilities or lack of security updates |
> | 7 | Identification and Authentication Failures | Incorrect implementation of authentication and session management |
> | 8 | Software and Data Integrity Failures | Lack of integrity checks on software updates, critical data, or CI/CD pipelines |
> | 9 | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response to security incidents |
> | 10 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Fetching remote resources without validating the user-supplied URL |
>
> This list highlights the diverse range of vulnerabilities that security engineering must address, from code-level issues to design flaws and operational concerns.

> [!idea] Security Engineering: A Comprehensive Approach
> Security engineering addresses these challenges by:
> - Implementing **secure coding** practices throughout the development process
> - Conducting thorough and regular **vulnerability assessments**
> - Designing systems with **security as a fundamental** principle, not an afterthought
> - Continuously **updating and patching** software to address new threats
> 
> By prioritizing security throughout the software development lifecycle, we can mitigate risks and build more resilient systems.
