idea - pointer authentication
- building off stack canaries
	- what if we store a value in the pointer itself, rather than below it?
	- use the unused bits in a 64 bit address to store a secret value (pointer authentication code)
	- this is possible because we can't use all 64 bits anyway. At most we use 42.
	- before using this pointer, check if the PAC is still valid
		- if not, crash
		- if yes, restore the unused bits (22 zeroes i believe) and use the address normally
	- can be used all of the pointers on the stack and heap too!
