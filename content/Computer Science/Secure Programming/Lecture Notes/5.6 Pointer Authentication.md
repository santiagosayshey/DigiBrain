idea - pointer authentication
- building off stack canaries
	- what if we store a value in the pointer itself, rather than below it?
	- use the unused bits in a 64 bit address to store a secret value (pointer authentication code)
	- this is possible because we can't use all 64 bits anyway. At most we use 42.
	- before using this pointer, check if the PAC is still valid
		- if not, crash
		- if yes, restore the unused bits (22 zeroes i believe) and use the address normally
	- can be used all of the pointers on the stack and heap too!

idea - PAC properties
- every address has a unique PAC (no collisions!). This means you cannot change the address without also changing the PAC
- can only be figured out using the CPU's master secret which is not accessible to programs

consider - then how do we break pointer auth?
- trick the program into generating a PAC for an address (how? why?)
- learn the master secret - OS vulnerability. not feasible, because these are usually hardcoded into CPUs 
- brute force - only 2^22 bits for PAC, so its certainly possible
- pointer reuse
	- copy the PAC for another pointer and reuse that pointer elsewhere (explain further please)
