> [!motivation] Motivation for Heap Vulnerabilities
> In software security, attackers often aim to **manipulate program execution** by exploiting memory layout. Heap vulnerabilities present an opportunity to **overwrite pointers** that will eventually be used for program flow, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
> 
> We can do this two ways:
> 
> **Use After Free**
> When a program frees it's memory before it needs to, another program is able to allocate and interact with that memory! This means if an attacker is able to adjust some return addresses (say in a vtable), and the program tries to execute something from that memory, then the injected code will be executed instead.
> 
> **Heap Overflow**
> During program execution, we can overflow an exploitable buffer and change adjacent return addresses (vtable addresses) and execute malicious code instead.

> [!idea] Heap and Memory Structure
> Memory layout:
> - **Heap**: Contains objects (instances of classes)
>   - Objects include instance variables and a pointer to their class's vtable
> - **Data segment**: Contains vtables (tables of function pointers for each class)
> - **Code segment**: Contains the actual implementation of methods

> Key points:
> - Only **objects reside in the heap**
> - **Vtables are typically in the data segment**, not the heap
> - **Method implementations are in the code segment**
> 
> Vulnerability mechanism:
> 1. **Buffer overflow** in one object can overwrite adjacent memory
> 2. Attacker can inject shellcode and **modify vtable pointers**
> 3. When a method is called, it **executes the injected shellcode** instead


> [!example] Exploiting C++ Vtables
> Consider two adjacent objects in heap memory:
> 1. Object of ClassX with a buffer overflow vulnerability
> 2. Object of ClassY with methods that will be called later
> 
> Exploitation steps:
> 1. Overflow buffer in ClassX object
> 2. Inject shellcode into the overflow
> 3. Overwrite ClassY's vtable pointer to point to the shellcode
> 4. When a ClassY method is called, shellcode executes instead
