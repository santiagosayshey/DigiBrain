> [!motivation] Injection Flaws
**User input can be weaponized** for malicious purposes by sending untrusted, harmful data to an interpreter.
> 
> - **Injection Attacks**:
>   - SQL injection can manipulate database queries
>   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) injects malicious scripts into web pages
>   - Command injection executes unauthorized system commands
> 
> - **Consequences**:
>   - Data breaches exposing sensitive information
>   - Unauthorized access to systems
>   - Manipulation or destruction of data
>   - Service disruptions and system crashes
> 
> **Real-world impacts**:
> - The 2011 Sony PlayStation Network breach, caused by SQL injection, exposed data of 77 million users
> - In 2017, a simple XSS vulnerability in TweetDeck allowed attackers to create self-retweeting tweets
> 
> To mitigate these risks, we need robust **input sanitization** techniques. This process helps ensure that user input is safe before it's processed by our systems, significantly reducing the attack surface.


> [!idea] Input Sanitization
> Input sanitization is the process of **cleaning and validating user input** to prevent malicious data from entering a system.
> 
> Key Aspects:
> - Validation: Ensuring input meets expected format and criteria
> - Escaping: Converting special characters to safe representations
> - Stripping: Removing potentially harmful elements from input
> 
> Common Techniques:
> - **Whitelisting allowed characters or inputs**
> - **Using parameterized queries** for database operations
> - **Encoding output** to prevent XSS attacks
> - Implementing strict type checking
> 
> Benefits:
> - **Reduces risk of injection attacks**
> - Improves overall system security and stability
> - Helps maintain data integrity
> 
> **Effective input sanitization** is a critical component of a robust security strategy, working alongside other measures like input validation and output encoding.
