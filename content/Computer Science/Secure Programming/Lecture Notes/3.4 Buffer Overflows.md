> [!idea] Buffer Overflow
> A buffer overflow occurs when an operation **interacts with memory outside of a specified array**. This happens when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.
> 
> - Occurs when accessing array elements beyond its defined size
> - Can overwrite adjacent memory, including other variables or critical data
> - Potential to modify return addresses, leading to arbitrary code execution

> [!example] Simple Buffer Overflow
> ```c
> char name[4];  // Array of 4 characters
> name[5] = 'a'; // Accessing 6th element (index 5) - out of bounds!
> ```
> This example demonstrates writing beyond the array's allocated memory, potentially overwriting adjacent data.

> [!consider] Implications of Buffer Overflows
> - **Data Corruption**: Overwriting adjacent variables or data structures
> - **Security Vulnerabilities**: Potential to modify sensitive information
> - **Control Flow Hijacking**: Overwriting return addresses to execute arbitrary code
> 
> Buffer overflows can be particularly dangerous when they allow attackers to manipulate a program's execution flow, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution.

> [!example] Vulnerable C Function
> ```c
> void vulnerable_function() {
>     char buffer[8];
>     int important_flag = 0;
>     
>     printf("Enter your name: ");
>     gets(buffer);  // Dangerous! No bounds checking
>     
>     if (important_flag != 0) {
>         printf("How did you do that?\n");
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> In this example:
> - `buffer` is allocated 8 bytes
> - `important_flag` is stored adjacent to `buffer` in memory
> - `gets()` is used, which doesn't perform bounds checking
> - An attacker could input more than 8 characters to overflow `buffer` and modify `important_flag`
> 
> ```
> Memory layout:
> [buffer (8 bytes)][important_flag (4 bytes)]
> ```
> 
> By inputting 12 or more characters, an attacker overwrites `important_flag`, potentially bypassing security checks or altering program behavior.

This format provides a structured overview of buffer overflows, including their definition, implications, and a practical example of a vulnerable function. The use of callouts helps to organize the information into distinct sections for easier understanding and reference.
