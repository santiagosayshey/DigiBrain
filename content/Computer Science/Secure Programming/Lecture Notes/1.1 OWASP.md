I understand. I'll create a more comprehensive motivation callout that introduces the broader scope of security engineering and secure programming, using the two cases as supplementary examples. This callout will set the stage for the entire class.

> [!motivation] The Critical Need for Security Engineering
> In our increasingly digital world, software vulnerabilities pose significant risks:
> 
> - Widespread Impact:
>   - Software runs critical infrastructure, financial systems, and medical devices
>   - Vulnerabilities can affect millions of users globally
> 
> - Evolving Threat Landscape:
>   - Cyber attacks grow in sophistication and frequency
>   - New technologies introduce novel attack vectors
> 
> - High Stakes:
>   - Financial losses: Data breaches cost companies millions
>   - Human cost: Software errors can lead to injury or death
>   - Reputational damage: Security incidents erode public trust
> 
> Real-world cases illustrate these risks:
> 1. Therac-25 incident (1985-1987):
>    - Medical software bug caused radiation overdoses, resulting in patient deaths
> 
> 2. Equifax data breach (2017):
>    - Exploit of a single vulnerability led to exposure of 147 million consumers' data
> 
> Security engineering addresses these challenges by:
> - Implementing secure coding practices
> - Conducting thorough vulnerability assessments
> - Designing systems with security as a fundamental principle
> - Continuously updating and patching software
> 
> By prioritizing security throughout the software development lifecycle, we can mitigate risks and build more resilient systems.
