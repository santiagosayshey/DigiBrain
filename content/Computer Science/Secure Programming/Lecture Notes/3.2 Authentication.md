> [!idea] Authentication
> Authentication addresses the question: "**Who am I and how can I prove it?**"
> 
> Proof factors:
> - Something I know: e.g., password
> - Something I have: e.g., token, phone
> - Something I am: e.g., fingerprint, retina, typing pattern
> 
> These factors can be used individually or in combination to verify a user's identity.

> [!consider] Authentication Vulnerabilities
> Attackers can impersonate legitimate users by compromising authentication factors:
> 
> - **Stealing "something you know"**:
>   - Keyloggers capture passwords as they're typed
>   - Network sniffing intercepts transmitted credentials
> 
> - **Compromising "something you have"**:
>   - Intercepting or cloning physical tokens
>   - SIM swapping to gain control of a phone number
> 
> - **Replicating "something you are"**:
>   - Creating fake biometrics (e.g., 3D-printed fingerprints)
>   - Capturing and replaying biometric data
>   - Using lifelike masks (as seen in Mission Impossible films) to fool facial recognition systems
> 
> These methods highlight the importance of multi-factor authentication and secure transmission of authentication data.
