> **Components:**
> - Threats: Potential causes of unwanted events
> - Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses that can be exploited
> - Consequences: Potential impact or damage if a risk materializes
> 
> **Importance of Risk Assessment:**
> - Holistic View: Considers multiple factors affecting risk
> - Accurate Prioritization: Helps focus on most critical risks
> - Resource Optimization: Guides efficient allocation of security resources
> - Proactive Mitigation: Enables targeted preventive measures
> - Informed Decision-Making: Supports cost-effective security investments
> 
> **Risk Assessment Process:**
> 1. Identify assets and their vulnerabilities
> 2. Determine potential threats
> 3. Analyze existing controls
> 4. Assess likelihood and consequences
> 5. Calculate risk levels
