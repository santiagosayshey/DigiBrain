> [!idea] Threat Modelling
> Threat modelling is a structured approach to **identifying, quantifying, and addressing security risks** associated with an application or system. 
> 
> - **Definition**: A process of optimizing network security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, then defining countermeasures to prevent or mitigate the effects of threats to the system.
> 
> - **Core Components**:
>   1. Asset identification
>   2. Architectural overview
>   3. Threat identification
>   4. Vulnerability identification
>   5. Attack modeling
>   6. Risk analysis
>   7. Mitigation planning
> 
> - **Goals**:
>   - Identify security requirements
>   - Pinpoint potential vulnerabilities
>   - Determine attack vectors
>   - Prioritize security efforts
> 
> - **When to Perform**:
>   - Early in the software development lifecycle
>   - During major system changes
>   - Periodically as part of security maintenance
> 
> Threat modeling enables teams to make informed decisions about security tradeoffs and resource allocation in software development and system design.

> [!consider] Kerckhoff's Principle: The Foundation of Modern Security
> Key Concept: **A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge**.
> 
> Consider the following implications of Kerckhoff's Principle:
> 
> | Question | Answer |
> |----------|--------|
> | How does open scrutiny of a system enhance its security? | Open scrutiny allows for peer review, enabling the discovery and patching of vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. |
> | Why might "security through obscurity" be a flawed approach? | Obscurity can be breached, leaving the system vulnerable. Once the hidden mechanism is discovered, the entire security breaks down. |
> 
> - **Security through obscurity**: Bad
> - **Security through transparency**: Good
>
> Key takeaway: A system should be secure because of its design, not because its design is secret.


> [!consider] Responding to Threats in Software Development
> After evaluating a risk, there are four primary strategies for responding to threats in your software project. Each strategy has its own approach and is suitable for different scenarios.
> 
> | Response Strategy | Description | Implementation Example | When to Use | Real-World Example |
> |-------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
> | Risk Avoidance | Eliminate the risk completely | Remove a high-risk optional feature from the software | When the risk outweighs the benefit of a feature or process | Apple's decision to not support Flash on iOS devices due to security concerns |
> | Risk Transference | Shift responsibility to another party | Outsource a web service to a vendor with penalty clauses for failures | For large, complex risks beyond your organization's capacity to manage | Companies using cloud services like AWS, transferring infrastructure risks |
> | Risk Mitigation | Reduce likelihood or impact of the risk | Implement input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities | When risks can be reduced to an acceptable level through controls | Implementing HTTPS across all web applications to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks |
> | Risk Acceptance | Acknowledge the risk without additional action | Accept minor UI glitches in non-critical areas | For negligible risks or those with easy recovery | Accepting the risk of occasional app crashes in non-critical mobile games |
> 
> Key Considerations:
> - Not all risks can be avoided, transferred, or mitigated.
> - The choice of strategy depends on the risk level, potential harm, and cost-benefit analysis.
> - Risk **acceptance should be a conscious decision, not a default** due to oversight.
> - Regularly reassess your risk response strategies as the project evolves.
> 
> Remember: The goal is to manage risks effectively, balancing security with functionality and resource constraints.

> [!example] Threat Modeling Techniques
> Different threat modeling techniques offer varying approaches to identifying and addressing security risks:
> 
> 1. **Trike**
>    - Philosophy: Risk-centric approach
>    - Key features:
>      - Focuses on satisfying the security auditing process
>      - Uses a risk-based approach with asset-based modeling
>      - Emphasizes defensive strategies
> 
> 2. **VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling)**
>    - Philosophy: Scalable and streamlined for Agile environments
>    - Key features:
>      - Uses visual representations for better communication
>      - Designed for integration into Agile and DevOps workflows
>      - Emphasizes automation and repeatability
> 
> 3. **P.A.S.T.A. (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**
>    - Philosophy: Aligns business objectives with technical requirements
>    - Key features:
>      - Seven-stage process
>      - Risk-centric approach
>      - Emphasizes attacker motivation
>      - Produces threat enumeration and scoring
> 
> 4. **STRIDE**
>    - Philosophy: Focuses on six specific threat categories
>    - Key features:
>      - Mnemonic for threat categories: 
>        - Spoofing
>        - Tampering
>        - Repudiation
>        - Information disclosure
>        - Denial of service
>        - Elevation of privilege
>      - System-centric approach
>      - Widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness
> 
> Each technique offers unique strengths, and the choice often depends on the specific needs of the project, team expertise, and organizational culture.
