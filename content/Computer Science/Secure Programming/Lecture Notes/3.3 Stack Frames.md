> [!idea] Stack and Function Calls
> Stacks are **first in, last out** data structures used to manage function calls. When a function is called, a new **stack frame** is created on the stack. This frame stores important information such as the function's local variables, parameters, and the return address for when the function completes.

> |                | Saved EBP                           | The previous function's base pointer.            |
> | EBP →          | Return address                      | The address to return to after the function ends.|
> |                | Parameter 1                         | The first parameter passed to the current function.|
> |                | Parameter 2                         | The second parameter passed to the current function.|
> |                | **[Bottom of Stack]**               |                                                  |

> - **ESP (Stack Pointer)**: Points to the top of the stack, where the most recent data (such as local variables) is stored.
> - **EBP (Base Pointer)**: Points to the saved base pointer, marking the base of the current stack frame, just above the return address.
> 
> The stack operates through two primary operations:
> - **push**: Decreases ESP and stores a value at the new ESP location, effectively adding data to the top of the stack.
> - **pop**: Retrieves the value at the current ESP and then increments ESP, removing data from the top of the stack.
