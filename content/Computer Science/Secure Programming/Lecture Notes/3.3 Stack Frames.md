> [!idea] Stack and Function Calls
> Stacks are **first in, last out** data structures well suited to containing data used by processes. When a function is called, a dedicated space called a **stack frame** is created on the stack to hold the function's local variables and parameters.
> 
> Two crucial pointers manage this space:
> - The **EBP (Base Pointer)** points to the base of the current stack frame.
> - The **ESP (Stack Pointer)** points to the top of the current stack frame.
> 
> Both EBP and ESP are stored in CPU registers for quick access. As new functions are called, stack frames grow downwards in memory, with each new frame positioned below the previous one.
> 
> The stack operates primarily through two operations:
> - **push** decrements the ESP and stores a value at the new ESP location, effectively adding data to the top of the stack.
> - **pop** retrieves the value at the current ESP and then increments ESP, removing data from the top of the stack.
> 
> When a function is called:
> 1. **Arguments** are pushed onto the stack in reverse order, meaning the last argument is pushed first and the first argument last.
> 2. The **return address** (the location in the code to return to after the function executes) is pushed onto the stack.
> 3. The current **EBP** (the base pointer of the calling function) is pushed onto the stack to save the previous stack frame's base.
> 4. **EBP** is then set to the current value of ESP, establishing a new base for the called function's stack frame.
> 5. **Space for local variables** is allocated by decrementing ESP to reserve memory on the stack.
> 
> The stack at three key stages of a function call:
> 
> 1. **Right before a function call**:
> 
> | Pointer | Value       |
> |---------|-------------|
> |         | Argument 2  |
> |         | Argument 1  |
> | ESP →   |             |
> 
> 2. **After the function is called and setup is complete**:
> 
> | Pointer | Value          |
> |---------|----------------|
> |         | Argument 2     |
> |         | Argument 1     |
> |         | Return Address |
> | EBP →   | Old EBP        |
> |         | Local Variable 1 |
> |         | Local Variable 2 |
> | ESP →   |                |
> 
> When a function completes:
> 1. The **return value** is typically stored in a designated register (often EAX) rather than on the stack.
> 2. **ESP** is moved back to the current value of EBP, effectively deallocating the local variables by resetting the stack pointer.
> 3. The previous **EBP** value is **popped** from the stack, restoring the caller's stack frame.
> 4. The **return address** is **popped**, transferring control back to the calling function.
> 5. The calling function may **adjust ESP** to remove any pushed arguments, finalizing the cleanup of the stack.
> 
> 3. **When the function is done (just before returning)**:
> 
> | Pointer | Value          |
> |---------|----------------|
> |         | Argument 2     |
> |         | Argument 1     |
> |         | Return Address |
> | EBP →   | Old EBP        |
> | ESP →   |                |
> 
> This process ensures that the stack is properly maintained and that control is correctly returned to the calling function, with the stack in the same state it was before the function call.
