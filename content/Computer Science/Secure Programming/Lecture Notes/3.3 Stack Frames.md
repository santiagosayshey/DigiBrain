> [!idea] Stack and Function Calls
> Stacks are **first in, last out** data structures used to manage function calls. When a function is called, a new **stack frame** is created on the stack for that function's execution.
>
> Both **EBP (Base Pointer)** and **ESP (Stack Pointer)** are stored in CPU registers for quick access:
> - **EBP** points to the base of the current stack frame.
> - **ESP** points to the top of the current stack frame.
>
> As new functions are called, stack frames grow downwards in memory, with each new frame positioned below the previous one.
>
> The stack operates primarily through two operations:
> - **push**: Decrements ESP and stores a value at the new ESP location, effectively adding data to the top of the stack.
> - **pop**: Retrieves the value at the current ESP and then increments ESP, removing data from the top of the stack.
