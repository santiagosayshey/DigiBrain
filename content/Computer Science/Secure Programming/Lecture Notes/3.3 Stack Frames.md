Stacks are first in, last out data structures well suited to containing data used by processes.

When your code calls a function, space is made on the stack for the local variables of that function. This space is called a stack frame. Two pointers are used to define this space - the EBP (Base Pointer)
The function pushes and pops variables to and the from the stack, eventually calculating its final value (the return value)
