Stacks are first in, last out data structures well suited to containing data used by processes.

When your code calls a function, space is made on the stack for the local variables of that function. This space is called a stack frame. Two pointers are used to define this space - the EBP (Base Pointer) points to the top of the current stack frame. The ESP (Stack Pointer) points to the bottom of the current stack frame. These pointers are stored in external registers. 

Stacks use operations like push (put something at the bottom of the stack) and pop (remove something from the bottom of the stack) to compute the operations defined by a function. Stack frames grow downwards, with the ESP moving to point to the most bottom value at all times. 

give an example of this in a code block using low level code.

Once all of the operations of a function is finished, the ESP and EBP move such that the data can be overwritten and the return value exists at the virtual "top of the stack". Please reword this to make more sense.

give a full example of how this might work for a couple basic functions that call each other. Give the high level code, the low level code, and show how the stack looks like using a table at every operation.
