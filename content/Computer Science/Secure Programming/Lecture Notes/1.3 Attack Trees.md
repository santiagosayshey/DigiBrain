> [!idea] Attack Trees
> Attack trees are structures that show how an attacker might reach a goal, like a family tree of attacks. Key aspects include:
> 
> - **Definition**: A tree-like diagram that maps out different ways an attacker could achieve their goal.
> 
> - **Structure**:
>   - Root: The top of the tree, showing the attacker's main goal
>   - Branches: Different paths or methods branching down from the goal
>   - Leaves: The bottom-most parts, showing specific actions an attacker might take
> 
> - **Purpose**:
>   - Identify potential threats
>   - Analyze possible attack paths
>   - Prioritize security measures
> 
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Provides a clear visual of possible attacks
>   - Helps understand complex attack scenarios
>   - Makes it easier to explain threats to non-technical people
> 
> Attack trees help security teams "see" potential threats, making it easier to plan comprehensive defenses.


> [!example] Sample Attack Tree: Unauthorized Access to a Server
> Here's a simplified attack tree for gaining unauthorized access to a server:
> 
> ```
> Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access to Server
> |
> |-- 1. Exploit Software Vulnerability
> |   |-- 1.1 Find unpatched vulnerability
> |   |-- 1.2 Develop exploit
> |   `-- 1.3 Execute exploit
> |
> |-- 2. Obtain Valid Credentials
> |   |-- 2.1 Social Engineering
> |   |   |-- 2.1.1 Phishing attack
> |   |   `-- 2.1.2 Pretexting
> |   |
> |   |-- 2.2 Brute Force Attack
> |   |   |-- 2.2.1 Dictionary attack
> |   |   `-- 2.2.2 Rainbow table attack
> |   |
> |   `-- 2.3 Intercept Network Traffic
> |       |-- 2.3.1 Man-in-the-middle attack
> |       `-- 2.3.2 Packet sniffing
> |
> `-- 3. Physical Access
>     |-- 3.1 Break into facility
>     `-- 3.2 Insider threat
> ```

> This attack tree illustrates various paths an attacker might take to gain unauthorized access to a server. Each branch represents a different approach, with sub-branches detailing specific methods or steps within that approach.

This structure provides both a conceptual understanding of attack trees and a concrete example of how they are constructed and used in security analysis.
