> [!idea] Attack Trees
> Attack trees are a flowchart that **show how an attacker might reach a goal**, like a family tree of attacks. Key aspects include:
> 
> - **Definition**: A tree-like diagram that maps out different ways an attacker could achieve their goal.
> 
> - **Structure**:
>   - Root: The top of the tree, showing the attacker's main goal
>   - Branches: Different paths or methods branching down from the goal
>   - Leaves: The bottom-most parts, showing specific actions an attacker might take
> 
> - **Purpose**:
>   - Identify potential threats
>   - Analyze possible attack paths
>   - Prioritize security measures
> 
> - **Benefits**:
>   - Provides a clear visual of possible attacks
>   - Helps understand complex attack scenarios
>   - Makes it easier to explain threats to non-technical people
> 
> Attack trees help security teams **"see" potential threats**, making it easier to plan comprehensive defenses.
