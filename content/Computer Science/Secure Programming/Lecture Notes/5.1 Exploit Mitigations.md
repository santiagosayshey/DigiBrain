please write notes based  on my outline:

motivation - we need to protect a legacy codebase that was written in a non safe memory language without mem safety in mind. How we do protect it?

idea - exploit mitigation. We can't fix what we have, we just need to protect it. 
- compiler and runtime defence
- turn exploits into crashes
- goal is to eliminate vulnerabilities. vulnerabilities are exploitable bugs. So we need to eliminate bugs and prevent exploitation
