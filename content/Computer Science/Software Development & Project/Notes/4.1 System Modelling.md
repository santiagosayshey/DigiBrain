> [!idea]+ System Models  
> System models help us to **conceptualise a software system**. We take requirements, turn them into a model, and then use this model to help structure our implementation. **System models are like blueprints.** They help us to:  
> - Analyse functionality  
> - Communicate ideas  
> - Design and implement
>  
> They are implemented as graphical representations that abstract specific views or perspectives:  
>  
> - **External:** Showing the system's context or environment  
>   - *Example:* A **Context Diagram** that illustrates how a software system interacts with external entities, such as users, other systems, or devices. This might show an e-commerce platform interacting with payment gateways, shipping services, and customer databases.
>  
> - **Behavioural:** Showing the system's behaviour  
>   - *Example:* A **State Machine Diagram** that details the various states an object or component within the system can be in, and the transitions between these states. For example, a user account might have states like "Active," "Suspended," or "Closed," with transitions triggered by actions such as login attempts or account deletion.
>  
> - **Structural:** Showing the system architecture  
>   - *Example:* A **Class Diagram** in UML that outlines the classes within the system, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. For instance, in a library management system, the diagram might include classes like `Book`, `Member`, and `Loan`, with associations showing that members can borrow books.
>  
> - **Interactive:** Showing how the system and its components interact with its users  
>   - *Example:* A **Sequence Diagram** that captures the interaction between a user and the system over time, often in the form of a series of messages or function calls. In an online shopping system, this could illustrate the sequence of actions when a user adds items to a cart, proceeds to checkout, and completes a purchase.
