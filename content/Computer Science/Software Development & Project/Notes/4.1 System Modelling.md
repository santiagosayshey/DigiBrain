> [!idea]+ System Models  
> System models help us to **conceptualise a software system**. We take requirements, turn them into a model, and then use this model to help structure our implementation. **System models are like blueprints.** They help us to:  
> - Analyse functionality  
> - Communicate ideas  
> - Design and implement
>  
> They are implemented as graphical representations that abstract specific views or perspectives:  
>  
> - **External:** Showing the system's context or environment  
>   - *Example:* A **Context Diagram** that illustrates how a software system interacts with external entities, such as users, other systems, or devices. This might show an e-commerce platform interacting with payment gateways, shipping services, and customer databases.
>  
> - **Behavioural:** Showing the system's behaviour  
>   - *Example:* A **State Machine Diagram** that details the various states an object or component within the system can be in, and the transitions between these states. For example, a user account might have states like "Active," "Suspended," or "Closed," with transitions triggered by actions such as login attempts or account deletion.
>  
> - **Structural:** Showing the system architecture  
>   - *Example:* A **Class Diagram** in UML that outlines the classes within the system, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. For instance, in a library management system, the diagram might include classes like `Book`, `Member`, and `Loan`, with associations showing that members can borrow books.
>  
> - **Interactive:** Showing how the system and its components interact with its users  
>   - *Example:* A **Sequence Diagram** that captures the interaction between a user and the system over time, often in the form of a series of messages or function calls. In an online shopping system, this could illustrate the sequence of actions when a user adds items to a cart, proceeds to checkout, and completes a purchase.

> [!idea]+ Context Models  
> **Context models** are used to **define the boundaries and interactions between a system and its external environment.** They provide a high-level view of the system in relation to other systems, users, and external entities. Context models help to:
> - Clarify the system's scope by showing what lies inside and outside the system boundary.
> - Identify external dependencies, such as other systems or services the system interacts with.
> - Highlight the interfaces and communication flows between the system and its environment.

> [!idea]+ Data Flow Models  
> **Data flow models** are used to represent **how data moves through a system**, detailing the processes that transform data, the data stores that hold it, and the external entities that interact with it. These models help to:
> - Visualize the flow of information within the system, from input to output.
> - Identify the processes that manipulate data and the data stores that hold it.
> - Understand how different parts of the system interact through the exchange of data.
>
> Data flow models are typically represented using **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**, which consist of the following elements:
> 
> - **Processes:** Represented by circles or ovals, processes depict operations that transform input data into output data. *Example:* In an order processing system, a process might represent the action of validating an order.
> 
> - **Data Stores:** Represented by rectangles (often drawn as parallel lines), data stores are repositories where data is held for later use. *Example:* A database storing customer information.
> 
> - **External Entities:** Represented by rectangles, external entities are outside the system boundary and interact with the system by providing or receiving data. *Example:* A supplier providing inventory data to the system.
> 
> - **Data Flows:** Represented by arrows, data flows indicate the direction of data movement between processes, data stores, and external entities. Each arrow is labeled with the data it carries. *Example:* An arrow labeled "Order Details" flowing from a customer (external entity) to an order validation process.
