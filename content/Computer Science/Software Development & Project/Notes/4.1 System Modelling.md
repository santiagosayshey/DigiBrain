Goal is to plan out a software system. Take requirements, turn that into a model. Use the model to help structure your implementation.


> [!idea]+ System Models
> System models help us to **conceptualise a software system**. We take requirements, turn them into a model and then use this model to help structure our implementation. **System models are like blueprints.** They help us to:
> - Analyse functionality
> - Communicate ideas
> - Plan design and implementation
> 
> They are implemented as graphical representations that abstract specific views or perspectives:
> - External: Showing the system's context or environment
> - Behavioural: Showing the systems behaviour
> - Structural: Showing the system architecture
> - Interactive: Showing how the system
