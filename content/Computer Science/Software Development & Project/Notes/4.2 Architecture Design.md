> [!idea] Software Architecture Design
> Software architecture design is a crucial phase that:
> - Identifies and defines major system components and their relationships
> - Establishes patterns for system organization and communication
> - Balances functional requirements with non-functional qualities (e.g., performance, security, scalability)
> 
> Key outputs:
> - High-level structure diagrams (e.g., component diagrams, deployment diagrams)
> - Interface specifications between major components
> - Design principles and patterns to be used across the system
> - Rationale for key architectural decisions
> 
> The architecture serves as a bridge between requirements and detailed design, guiding the entire development process and ensuring alignment with project goals.

> [!example] Banking System Architecture
> Here's a simplified architectural diagram for a banking system:

>     A[Client Interface] --> B[Authentication Service]
>     A --> C[Transaction Service]
>     C --> D[Account Management]
>     C --> E[Payment Processing]
>     D --> F[Database]
>     E --> F
>     B --> G[Security Layer]
>     C --> G
>     D --> G
>     E --> G
> ```
> 
> This diagram illustrates:
> - Major components: Client Interface, Authentication, Transaction Service, etc.
> - Interactions between components
> - Central role of the Security Layer in all operations

> [!consider] Importance of Architecture Design
> Architecture design is valuable for several reasons:
> 
> 1. **Stakeholder Communication**:
>    - Facilitates discussions on system structure and functionality
>    - Allows early feedback on what works and what doesn't
> 
> 2. **System Analysis**:
>    - Enables assessment of whether the proposed system can meet requirements
>    - Allows evaluation of performance and reliability at a high level
> 
> 3. **Early Design Considerations**:
>    - Forces developers to consider key design aspects early in the process
>    - Reduces the need for major refactoring later in development
> 
> 4. **Scalability Planning**:
>    - Helps in designing systems that can grow and adapt to future needs
> 
> 5. **Risk Mitigation**:
>    - Identifies potential technical challenges early in the project lifecycle
> 
> By addressing these aspects early, architecture design can significantly improve project outcomes and reduce development risks.

> [!idea] Choosing an Architecture
> When selecting a software architecture, it must satisfy both functional and non-functional requirements:
> 
> 1. **Performance**:
>    Example: A real-time trading system requiring response times under 10 milliseconds
> 
> 2. **Security**:
>    Example: A healthcare system needing end-to-end encryption for patient data
> 
> 3. **Safety**:
>    Example: An air traffic control system with redundant backup systems
> 
> 4. **Availability**:
>    Example: A cloud storage service guaranteeing 99.99% uptime
> 
> 5. **Maintainability**:
>    Example: A modular CMS allowing easy addition of new features without affecting existing ones

> [!consider] Architectural Conflicts
> Sometimes, requirements can conflict, requiring careful trade-offs:
> 
> - Large-grain components can improve performance by reducing inter-component communication
> - Fine-grain components enhance maintainability by isolating functionality
> 
> **Compromise Solution**: Modularize the system, using different granularities where appropriate
> - Example: Large-grain for performance-critical sections, fine-grain for frequently updated features
> - Note: This approach can increase development complexity

> [!example] Architectural Approaches: Monolithic vs. Microservices
> Here are two contrasting architectural approaches for an e-commerce system:
> 
> Monolithic Architecture:
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[Client] --> B[Monolithic Application]
>     B --> C[(Database)]
>     B --> D[External Services]
> ```
> 
> Microservices Architecture:
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[Client] --> B[API Gateway]
>     B --> C[User Service]
>     B --> D[Product Service]
>     B --> E[Order Service]
>     B --> F[Payment Service]
>     C --> G[(User DB)]
>     D --> H[(Product DB)]
>     E --> I[(Order DB)]
>     F --> J[(Payment DB)]
> ```
> 
> The monolithic architecture combines all functionality into a single application, which can be simpler to develop initially but harder to scale. The microservices architecture separates concerns into distinct services, improving scalability and maintainability at the cost of increased complexity in service communication and deployment.

> [!consider] Architectural Decisions
> The **quality** of software architecture largely **depends on the architect's experience**, as many factors are difficult to foresee:
> 
> - This unpredictability has driven the shift from waterfall to agile methodologies
> 
> Key questions to address when making architectural decisions:
> 
> 1. **Is there a generic template we can adapt?**
>    Example: Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for a web application
> 
> 2. **How should the system be distributed?**
>    Example: Deciding between a monolithic application or microservices for an e-commerce platform
> 
> 3. **What architectural style is appropriate?**
>    Example: Choosing between event-driven architecture for a real-time chat application vs. layered architecture for an enterprise resource planning system
> 
> 4. **What overall approach should we take?**
>    Example: Adopting a domain-driven design approach for a complex business application
> 
> 5. **How should we modularize the system?**
>    Example: Deciding to separate user authentication, product catalog, and order processing into distinct modules in an online retail system
> 
> 6. **How will we evaluate the architecture?**
>    Example: Using Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) to assess how well the architecture meets performance and modifiability goals
> 
> 7. **How should we document our architectural decisions?**
>    Example: Employing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to capture the context, consequences, and rationale behind each major architectural decision
> 
> These questions help guide the decision-making process, but answers often evolve as the project progresses. For instance, an initial decision to use a monolithic architecture might evolve into a microservices approach as the system scales and new requirements emerge.

> [!idea] Architectural Styles
> An architectural style is a pattern of system organization. Common styles include:
> 
> 1. **Client-Server**: 
>    - Separates system into clients (request services) and servers (provide services)
>    - Example: Web applications with browser clients and backend servers
> 
> 2. **Layered**: 
>    - Organizes system into layers with defined interfaces
>    - Example: OSI model in network protocols
> 
> 3. **Component-based**: 
>    - Builds system from reusable components
>    - Example: Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) architecture
> 
> 4. **Microservices**: 
>    - Decomposes system into small, independent services
>    - Example: Netflix's streaming platform
> 
> 5. **Event-driven**: 
>    - Components communicate through events
>    - Example: GUI frameworks like JavaFX
> 
> Key points:
> - Each style offers a standard implementation pattern
> - No one-size-fits-all solution exists
> - Hybrid approaches often yield best results
> 
> Choosing the right style depends on specific project requirements, team expertise, and system goals.

> [!idea] System Organization Strategies
> The overall strategy for organizing a system's architecture typically falls into three major styles:
> 
> 1. **Shared Data Repository**
> 2. **Client-Server (Shared Services)**
> 3. **Abstract Machine (Layered)**
> 
> These styles can be used separately or in combination, depending on the system requirements.

> [!idea] Shared Data Repository
> In this style, all subsystems share a central data structure.
> 
> Example: A content management system where multiple modules (user management, content creation, analytics) access a shared database.
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[User Management] --> D[(Central Database)]
>     B[Content Creation] --> D
>     C[Analytics] --> D
> 
>```

> [!idea] Client-Server (Shared Services)
> This style separates the system into clients that request services and servers that provide services.
> 
> Example: A web application where the browser acts as the client, requesting data and functionality from a backend server.
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph LR
>     A[Client 1] --> C[Server]
>     B[Client 2] --> C
>     C --> D[(Database)]
> 
>```

> [!idea] Abstract Machine (Layered)
> This style organizes the system into a hierarchy of layers, each providing services to the layer above it.
> 
> Example: The OSI model in network communications, or a three-tier application architecture (presentation, business logic, data access).
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[Presentation Layer] --> B[Business Logic Layer]
>     B --> C[Data Access Layer]
>     C --> D[(Database)]
> 
> ```

> [!consider] Pros and Cons of Architectural Styles
> 
> | Style | Pros | Cons |
> |-------|------|------|
> | Shared Data Repository | - Efficient data sharing<br>- Centralized data management<br>- Easier data consistency | - Potential performance bottleneck<br>- Single point of failure<br>- Tight coupling between subsystems |
> | Client-Server | - Clear separation of concerns<br>- Scalability (can add more clients)<br>- Centralized data management | - Server can be a bottleneck<br>- Network dependency<br>- Complexity in server design |
> | Layered (Abstract Machine) | - Separation of concerns<br>- Easier to modify individual layers<br>- Supports standardization | - Performance overhead due to layer traversal<br>- Can lead to unnecessary work in lower layers<br>- Potential for tight coupling between layers |
> 
> These architectural styles can be used separately or in combination, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the system being developed. For example, a large-scale system might use a client-server architecture at the macro level, with individual servers implementing a layered architecture internally.

> [!idea] Decomposition Styles
> Decomposition involves **breaking down subsystems into modules**. Key points:
> - Subsystems function independently of other subsystems
> - Modules collectively power the whole system but aren't complete systems themselves
> 
> Two main styles of decomposition:
> 1. Object-Oriented Decomposition
> 2. Function-Oriented Decomposition

> [!idea] Object-Oriented Decomposition
> This style **organizes the system around data objects and their associated methods.**
> 
> Example: A library management system
> 
> ```mermaid
> classDiagram
>     class Book {
>         -title: String
>         -author: String
>         -ISBN: String
>         +checkout()
>         +returnBook()
>     }
>     class Member {
>         -name: String
>         -memberID: String
>         +borrowBook()
>         +returnBook()
>     }
>     class Library {
>         -books: List\<Book>
>         -members: List\<Member>
>         +addBook()
>         +removebook()
>         +registerMember()
>     }
>     Library "1" -- "*" Book: contains
>     Library "1" -- "*" Member: has
> 
>```
> 
> Pros:
> - Encapsulation of data and related operations
> - Easier to understand real-world mappings
> - Supports code reuse through inheritance
> 
> Cons:
> - Can lead to over-complicated hierarchies
> - Potential performance overhead
> - May be overkill for simple procedural problems

> [!idea] Function-Oriented Decomposition
> This style organizes the system around functional processes or operations.
> 
> Example: An order processing system
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[Order Processing System]
>     A --> B[Validate Order]
>     A --> C[Check Inventory]
>     A --> D[Process Payment]
>     A --> E[Ship Order]
>     B --> F[Input Validation]
>     B --> G[Business Rule Check]
>     C --> H[Query Inventory]
>     C --> I[Update Stock]
>     D --> J[Payment Gateway Integration]
>     D --> K[Transaction Recording]
>     E --> L[Generate Shipping Label]
>     E --> M[Update Order Status]
> 
>```
> 
> Pros:
> - Clear separation of concerns
> - Easier to optimize individual functions
> - Often simpler to implement for procedural tasks
> 
> Cons:
> - Can lead to data coupling between modules
> - May result in data duplication
> - Less intuitive for modeling complex real-world entities

> [!consider] Comparing Decomposition Styles
> 
> | Aspect | Object-Oriented | Function-Oriented |
> |--------|-----------------|-------------------|
> | Focus | Data and associated operations | Processes and operations |
> | Modularity | Based on objects/classes | Based on functions |
> | Data Handling | Encapsulated within objects | Passed between functions |
> | Reusability | Through inheritance and polymorphism | Through function calls and libraries |
> | Complexity Management | Objects model real-world entities | Breaks down complex processes |
> | Scalability | Good for large, complex systems | Better for smaller, procedure-focused systems |
> | Learning Curve | Steeper, requires OOP concepts | Generally simpler to grasp initially |
> 
> The choice between these styles often depends on the nature of the problem, team expertise, and system requirements. Many modern systems use a hybrid approach, leveraging the strengths of both styles where appropriate.

idea - control styles
- control flow between sub systems (like an API between the front and backend)
- two types (callouts for both)
	- Centralised
	- Event based
