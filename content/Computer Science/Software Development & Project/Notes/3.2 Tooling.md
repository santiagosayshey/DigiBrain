> [!idea]+ Software Development Tools
> 
> Tools in software development abstract complex processes, enhancing the software lifecycle. Key considerations:
> - Striking a balance between tool utility and user-friendliness
> - Evaluating options:
>   - Open-source vs. commercial solutions
>   - Security features and implications
>   - Learning curve relative to time savings
>   - Team's ability to adopt and leverage effectively

> [!consider]+ Reverting Code Changes
> 
> Without version control, reverting code would require:
> - Manually saving multiple file versions
> - Implementing a complex file naming and storage system
> - Significant care and experience to manage effectively
>
> Version control systems simplify this process with standardized commands, making code history management more efficient and less error-prone.

> [!idea]+ Version Control Systems
> 
> VCSs track file states over time, recording:
> - File contents
> - Timestamps
> - Owner information
> 
> Primarily used for text files, not binary files, due to efficient change tracking.
> 
> Two main types:
> - Distributed (e.g., Git): P2P-based with complete local repositories
> - Centralized: Client-server architecture with a single shared repository

> [!consider]+ Issues with Centralized VCS
> 
> Centralized systems like SVN face challenges:
> - Complex merge conflicts with simultaneous edits
> - Difficulty prioritizing conflicting changes
> - Single point of failure (central server)
> - Limited offline work capabilities

> [!idea]+ Git and Branching
> 
> Git uses branches to:
> - Isolate individual work
> - Manage parallel development
> - Facilitate easier merging and conflict resolution
>
> Branches allow:
> - Isolated feature development
> - Experimentation without affecting the main codebase
> - Streamlined code review and integration

> [!example]+ Git Workflow
> 
> Basic Git commands and their purposes:
>
> | Event | Command | Explanation |
> |-------|---------|-------------|
> | Stage changes | `git add <file>` | Prepare changes for commit |
> | Commit changes | `git commit -m "<message>"` | Create a snapshot of staged changes |
> | Push changes | `git push <remote> <branch>` | Send commits to remote repository |
> | Pull changes | `git pull` | Fetch and merge remote changes |

> [!idea]+ GitHub
> 
> GitHub provides:
> - Centralized Git repository hosting
> - Collaboration features (pull requests, issues)
> - CI/CD tool integration
> - Project management capabilities

> [!consider]+ Commit Messages
> 
> Effective commit messages include:
> - Concise title/summary
> - Detailed description of changes
> - Related ticket/issue ID
>
> Importance:
> - Facilitates code review
> - Aids in generating changelogs
> - Helps track project history and decision-making

> [!example]+ Good Commit Message
> 
> ```
> Add user authentication feature
> 
> - Implement OAuth2 flow for Google and Facebook login
> - Create user profile page with editable fields
> - Add session management and logout functionality
> 
> Closes #123
