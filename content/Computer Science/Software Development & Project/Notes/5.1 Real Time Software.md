idea - real time systems
- what is it? systems that monitor and control their environment; they run all the time and don't terminate, very usually hardware devices
	- recieve data
	- process data
	- return data
	- affect environment
- examples - sensors, actuators
- spefically: correct functionality of an RTS depends on the reuslts produced by the system and the time at which those results are produced
- elements include
	- sensor controls
		- collect infro from sensors. buffer info collected in response to a sensor stim
	- data processor
		- process the collected info and compute response
	- actuator process
		- generate control signals for the actuators
	- add a mermaid diagram here to show this process from sensor to actuator (sensor -> sensor control -> Data processor -> Actuator Control -> Actuator)

consider - types
- soft
	- missed deadlines still have some value to some extent
	- themometer
- firm
	- missed deadlines have no benefits or costs incurred
	- assembly line robot
- hard essential
	- missed deadline has a cost incurred
	- printer
- hard critical
	- missed deadline has a catastrophic cost incurred
	- nuclear system

idea - stimulus
- RT are stimulus / response systems
	- given an event (stimulus), the system must produce a response in a given time
- two types of events
	- periodic
		- occur at predictable intervals of time - example
	- aperiodic
		- occur at unpredictable times = system power failure

consider - design implications
- must allow for fast switching between stimulus handlers
	- sequential loop is usually not enough
	- need concurrent cooperating processes
	- priority
	- usually lots of sensors and actuators
	- Hard RTS usually written in assmebly for complete control and speed
	- C is also an option
	- based on non fucntional system requirements

idea - design process
1. identify events that needs to be processed and responded to
2. identify timing constraints
3. aggregate into concurrent processes
4. design algorithms to process each class of stim and response
5. design a scheduling system to ensure that processes are started in time

idea - modelling
- stimuluses trigger state switches
- we model these triggers and states using finite state machines
	- descibes tranistions from states to other states

example - finte state machine for petrol pump
- mermaid diagram for this please


idea - real time operating systems
- manage processes in real time systems
- responsible for process management, resource allocation
- include: (say what theyre used for)
	- clock 
		- information for scheduling
	- interrupt handler
		- manages aperodic requests for service
	- scheduler
		- choose which next process to run - fifo, spf, etc
		-  can be premptive (interupts other tasks)
		- non pre emptive -doesn't
		- the interrupt routine MUST be fast and simple
	- resource manager
		- allocate memory and processor resources
	- Dispatcher
		- starts process execution

example - rts operating system
- mermaid diagram again please

idea - periodic processes
- must be executed at specific, deterrmined times
- can be between executions, deadlines
- real time lcock ticks peroidically and each tick causes an interrupt to check for periodic processes

consieder - other real time systems
- monitoring and control systems
