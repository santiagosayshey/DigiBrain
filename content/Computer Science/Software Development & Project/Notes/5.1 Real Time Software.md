idea - real time systems
- what is it? systems that monitor and control their environment; they run all the time and don't terminate, very usually hardware devices
	- recieve data
	- process data
	- return data
	- affect environment
- examples - sensors, actuators
- spefically: correct functionality of an RTS depends on the reuslts produced by the system and the time at which those results are produced

consider - types
- soft
	- missed deadlines still have some value to some extent
	- themometer
- firm
	- missed deadlines have no benefits or costs incurred
	- assembly line robot
- hard essential
	- missed deadline has a cost incurred
	- printer
- hard critical
	- missed deadline has a catastrophic cost incurred
	- nuclear system

idea - stimulus
- RT are stimulus / response systems
	- given an event (stimulus), the system must produce a response in a given time
- two types of events
	- periodic
		- occur at predictable intervals of time - example
	- aperiodic
		- occur at unpredictable times = system power failure
