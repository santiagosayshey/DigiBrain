> [!idea]+ Software Processes
> A structured set of **activities to produce** or maintain a **software** product. These processes allow us to:
> - Improve efficiency in software development
> - Ensure quality and reliability of software products
> - Manage resources effectively
> - Meet project deadlines and milestones
> - Facilitate communication among team members
> - Standardize development practices
> - Track progress and identify issues early

> [!example] Software Process Model
> An abstract representation of a process used to describe steps and guide software teams throughout development. It acts as a **roadmap**.

> [!idea] Main Software Development Methodologies
> Two primary approaches to software development processes:
> 
> **Waterfall Model**
> - Example: Developing software for a heart surgery robot
>   - Requirements fully defined before design begins
>   - Rigorous testing before deployment
>   - Minimal changes after implementation
> - Resembles a waterfall cascading from one stage to the next
> - Key memory aid: Like water, it's difficult to go back upstream
> 
> **Agile Methodology**
> - Example: Developing an online multiplayer game
>   - Features added and balanced iteratively
>   - Regular updates based on player feedback
>   - Continuous refinement of gameplay mechanics
> - Named for its ability to move quickly and easily
> - Key memory aid: Think of an agile athlete, able to change direction rapidly

> | Aspect | Waterfall (Heart Surgery Robot) | Agile (Online Multiplayer Game) |
> |--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
> | Requirements | Fully defined upfront | Evolve as development progresses |
> | Testing | Comprehensive testing phase | Continuous testing throughout |
> | Delivery | Single release after full development | Regular updates and patches |
> | Risk Management | Extensive initial risk assessment | Ongoing risk evaluation and mitigation |
> | Changes | Difficult and costly to implement | Expected and easily accommodated |
> | User Feedback | Limited, mainly in initial stages | Continuous through beta testing and live service |
> | Documentation | Extensive and detailed | Lean, focuses on essential information |
> | Project Predictability | High, with less flexibility | Lower, but with higher adaptability |
