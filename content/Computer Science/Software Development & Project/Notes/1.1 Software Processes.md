> [!idea]+ Software Processes
> A structured set of **activities to produce** or maintain a **software** product. These processes allow us to:
> - Improve efficiency in software development
> - Ensure quality and reliability of software products
> - Manage resources effectively
> - Meet project deadlines and milestones
> - Facilitate communication among team members
> - Standardize development practices
> - Track progress and identify issues early

> [!example] Software Process Model
> An abstract representation of a process used to describe steps and guide software teams throughout development. It acts as a **roadmap**.

> [!idea] Agile / Waterfall
> Two primary approaches to software processes:
> 
> **Waterfall Model**
> - Sequential, linear approach
> - Each phase must be completed before the next begins
> - Emphasizes extensive planning and documentation
> 
> **Agile Methodology**
> - Iterative, incremental approach
> - Focuses on flexibility and rapid delivery
> - Emphasizes collaboration and adaptability to change
> 
> | Aspect | Waterfall | Agile |
> |--------|-----------|-------|
> | Flexibility | Less flexible; changes are costly | Highly flexible; embraces change |
> | Planning | Comprehensive upfront planning | Adaptive planning throughout |
> | Delivery | Single delivery at project end | Frequent incremental deliveries |
> | Customer Involvement | Limited, mainly at start and end | Continuous throughout the project |
> | Documentation | Extensive | Minimal, focuses on working software |
> | Risk Management | Early risk assessment | Continuous risk assessment |
> | Project Size | Better for larger, well-defined projects | Suited for smaller, less defined projects |
> | Team Structure | Hierarchical | Self-organizing, cross-functional teams |

This callout provides an overview of the two main software development methodologies and compares their key aspects, allowing readers to understand their fundamental differences.
