> [!idea]+ Software Processes
> A structured set of **activities to produce** or maintain a **software** product. These processes allow us to:
> - Improve efficiency in software development
> - Ensure quality and reliability of software products
> - Manage resources effectively
> - Meet project deadlines and milestones
> - Facilitate communication among team members
> - Standardize development practices
> - Track progress and identify issues early

> [!example] Software Process Model
> An abstract representation of a process used to describe steps and guide software teams throughout development. It acts as a **roadmap**.

1. Linear Development (Waterfall Model):
```
[Image description: A waterfall cascading down steps. Each step is labeled with a phase of development (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance). Arrows flow downward between steps, emphasizing the linear progression.]
```

2. Cyclical Development (Agile Methodology):
```
[Image description: A circular diagram with wedges representing different phases (Plan, Design, Develop, Test, Release, Review). Arrows connect the wedges in a clockwise direction, showing the continuous cycle. A spiral arrow emerging from the center illustrates progress over time.]
```

3. Spiral Model:
```
[Image description: A spiral starting from the center and moving outward. Each quadrant of the spiral represents a phase (Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering, Evaluation). As the spiral expands, it shows multiple iterations of these phases, with each loop representing a cycle of development.]
```

These images should help visually differentiate the three development methodologies and reinforce their key characteristics.
