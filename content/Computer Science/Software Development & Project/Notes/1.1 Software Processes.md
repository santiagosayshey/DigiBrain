> [!idea]+ Software Processes
> A structured set of **activities to produce** or maintain a **software** product. These processes allow us to:
> - Improve efficiency in software development
> - Ensure quality and reliability of software products
> - Manage resources effectively
> - Meet project deadlines and milestones
> - Facilitate communication among team members
> - Standardize development practices
> - Track progress and identify issues early

> [!example] Generic Software Process
> A typical software development lifecycle:
> 1. Requirements Analysis
>    - Gather and document user needs
>    - Define system specifications
> 2. Design
>    - Create high-level system architecture
>    - Develop detailed design specifications
> 3. Implementation
>    - Write code based on design
>    - Perform unit testing
> 4. Testing
>    - Conduct integration and system testing
>    - Perform user acceptance testing
> 5. Deployment
>    - Install the software in production environment
>    - Provide user training and documentation
> 6. Maintenance
>    - Fix bugs and issues
>    - Implement updates and enhancements
