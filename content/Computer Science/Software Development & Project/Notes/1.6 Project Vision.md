For users who struggle with InfluxDB's complex query language, our project, "InfluxUI," aims to deliver a no-code solution that simplifies data querying and visualization. InfluxUI is a web-based, user-friendly interface specifically designed for InfluxDB, an open-source time series database, and will also integrate with Grafana for advanced data visualization. Unlike the current InfluxDB interface, our product will allow users to generate queries and visualize data trends through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality without needing programming skills. This project is constrained to focusing on query building and data visualization, leaving other InfluxDB functionalities out of scope. Our goal is to enhance accessibility to powerful data analytics tools for non-programmers, providing seamless and secure integration with existing InfluxDB and Grafana setups.
