> 
> 
> - Example: Developing a complex financial system with evolving security requirements
>   - Iterative cycles of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation
>   - Each cycle results in a prototype or increment
>   - Extensive risk assessment at each stage
> - Key memory aid: Think of a spiral staircase, ascending while going in circles
> 
> Strengths:
> - Strong focus on risk management
> - Flexibility to incorporate changes
> - Allows for early user feedback
> - Suitable for large, high-risk projects
> 
> Weaknesses:
> - Complex and potentially time-consuming
> - Requires expertise in risk assessment
> - May be overkill for smaller projects
> - Can be costly due to extensive planning and risk analysis
