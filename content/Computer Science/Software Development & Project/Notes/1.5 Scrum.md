> [!idea] Scrum Framework
> An Agile framework for complex product development, emphasizing **iterative progress, team collaboration**, and rapid adaptation to change.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Self-organizing, cross-functional teams
> - Work divided into short, time-boxed iterations called Sprints
> - Regular inspection and adaptation of progress
> - Emphasis on transparency and continuous improvement
> 
> Strengths:
> - Promotes flexibility and adaptability
> - Enhances team collaboration and communication
> - Facilitates faster product delivery and feedback
> - Increases project visibility and accountability
> 
> Challenges:
> - Requires significant cultural shift in traditional organizations
> - May be challenging to implement in large or distributed teams
> - Can be misused as a micromanagement tool if not properly understood

> [!example] Typical Scrum Roadmap
> 1. Product Backlog Creation
>    - Product Owner defines and prioritizes product backlog items
> 
> 2. Sprint Planning
>    - Team selects items from product backlog for the upcoming sprint
>    - Create sprint backlog with tasks to complete selected items
> 
> 3. Sprint Execution (usually 1-4 weeks)
>    - Daily Scrum meetings to sync team progress
>    - Team works on sprint backlog items
> 
> 4. Sprint Review
>    - Team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders
>    - Gather feedback and update product backlog if needed
> 
> 5. Sprint Retrospective
>    - Team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements
> 
> 6. Repeat steps 2-5 for next sprint
