> [!motivation] The Need for Agile Development
> In software development:
> 1. Knowledge comes from experience
> 2. Decisions are made based on knowledge
> 3. Good decisions lead to good software
> 
> However, software development faces a fundamental challenge: **comprehensive knowledge is rare** and costly to acquire.
> 
> Traditional Waterfall methods rely on extensive upfront knowledge, which is often unavailable or quickly becomes outdated. These methods typically require teams of highly skilled, experienced engineers with deep expertise in complex system architecture. Such teams are rare, expensive, and take significant time to assemble.
> 
> Agile approaches, based on empiricism:
> - **Build knowledge iteratively** through experience and observation
> - **Adapt** to changing requirements
> - Enable **good decision-making even with incomplete knowledge**
> 
> By embracing empiricism, Agile methodologies like Scrum allow teams to develop effective software in dynamic environments where perfect knowledge is unattainable.

Certainly. I'll bold the key takeaways in the definition and the table:

> [!idea] Scrum Framework
> Scrum is an Agile framework that embodies **empirical principles**, designed to address the challenge of developing complex products in environments where **comprehensive knowledge is scarce**. It offers a **flexible, iterative approach** that **embraces change**, **builds knowledge through experience**, and **empowers teams to deliver value incrementally**. Scrum emphasizes **continuous learning, adaptation, and improvement** through **transparency, inspection, and adaptation**.

> | Step | Description | Example |
> |------|-------------|---------|
> | 1. Product Backlog Creation | **Product Owner defines and prioritizes product backlog items** | Creating a prioritized list of features for a new mobile app |
> | 2. Sprint Planning | **Team selects items from product backlog** for the upcoming sprint and **creates sprint backlog** | Choosing to implement user login and profile creation features for a 2-week sprint |
> | 3. Sprint Execution (1-4 weeks) | **Daily Scrum meetings** to sync team progress; **team works on sprint backlog items** | Daily 15-minute stand-ups; developing and testing the login functionality |
> | 4. Sprint Review | **Team demonstrates completed work** to stakeholders; **gather feedback** and update product backlog if needed | Showcasing the working login feature to project stakeholders; noting suggestions for UI improvements |
> | 5. Sprint Retrospective | **Team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements** | Discussing how to improve estimation accuracy or communication within the team |
> | 6. Repeat | **Steps 2-5 are repeated for the next sprint** | Planning the next sprint to implement user profile editing features |

> 
> Key aspects:
> - **Self-organizing, cross-functional teams**
> - Work divided into **short, time-boxed iterations** called Sprints
> - **Regular inspection and adaptation** of progress
> - Emphasis on **transparency and continuous improvement**



> [!consider] Scrum Terminology
> | Term | Definition |
> |------|------------|
> | Scrum Master | Facilitator for the Scrum Team, ensuring the Scrum framework is followed |
> | Product Owner | Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and managing the product backlog |
> | Development Team | Self-organizing group that creates the product increments |
> | Sprint | Time-boxed iteration, typically 1-4 weeks long |
> | Product Backlog | Ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product |
> | Sprint Backlog | Set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint |
> | Daily Scrum | 15-minute daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities |
> | Sprint Review | Meeting at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog |
> | Sprint Retrospective | Opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements |
> | Increment | Sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint |

> [!example] University Club Platform Project (12-week course)
> 
> Team Composition:
> - Product Owner: Tutor/Teaching Assistant
> - Scrum Master: Rotating role among 6 students
> - Development Team: 6 students (including the current Scrum Master)
> 
> Project: Develop a club platform for the university
> 
> Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
> Total Sprints: 6 (12-week course)
> 
> Sprint 1-2: Foundation and User Authentication
> - Sprint 1 Scrum Master: Student A
> - Sprint 2 Scrum Master: Student B
> 
> Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):
> Week 1:
> - Monday:
>   - PO (Tutor): Presents initial project requirements, answers questions
>   - SM (Student A): Facilitates Sprint Planning, ensures team understands the goal
>   - Team: Breaks down tasks, volunteers for initial work
>     - Set up project repository and development environment
>     - Design database schema for users and clubs
>     - Begin implementing user registration and login
> - Wednesday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting, addresses any obstacles
>   - Team: Each member shares progress and plans
> - Friday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting
>   - Team: Updates on progress, adjusts tasks as needed
> 
> Week 2:
> - Monday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting
>   - Team: Continues work, addresses any blockers
> - Wednesday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting
>   - Team: Prepares for sprint end, identifies remaining tasks
> - Friday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Sprint Review and Retrospective
>   - PO: Provides feedback on completed work
>   - Team: Demonstrates progress, reflects on the sprint
> 
> Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):
> Week 3:
> - Monday:
>   - New SM (Student B) takes over
>   - PO: Updates priorities based on Sprint 1 results
>   - SM: Facilitates Sprint Planning for new goals
>   - Team: Plans tasks for club management features
>     - Implement club creation and editing
>     - Develop club search functionality
>     - Create user profiles with club affiliations
> - Wednesday & Friday: Scrum Meetings
> 
> Week 4:
> - Monday & Wednesday: Scrum Meetings
> - Friday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Review and Retrospective
>   - PO: Evaluates progress, may adjust overall project direction
>   - Team: Showcases new features, discusses improvements for next sprint
> 
> Throughout both sprints:
> - PO (Tutor): Available during class times, responds to queries via agreed communication channel
> - Rotating SM: Facilitates scheduled Scrum meetings, coordinates team communication
> - Team: Self-organizes, collaborates, focuses on delivering working features
> - Between meetings: Team communicates via messaging apps or project management tools

> [!idea] Daily Standup: The Three Questions
> 
> Daily standups, also known as daily scrums, are brief, focused meetings. They center around three key questions:
> 
> 1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
>    - Briefly summarize completed tasks
>    - Focus on work that contributes to the sprint goal
>    - Mention any significant progress or milestones
> 
> 2. What will I do today?
>    - Outline planned tasks for the day
>    - Prioritize work that moves the team closer to the sprint goal
>    - Be specific about what you intend to complete
> 
> 3. Are there any obstacles in my way?
>    - Identify any blockers or impediments
>    - Briefly describe challenges that may slow progress
>    - This is not for problem-solving, just identification
> 
> Key Points:
> - Keep responses brief and to the point
> - Focus on sprint-related work
> - The meeting should typically last no more than 15 minutes
> - It's not a status report to management, but a sync among team members
> - Stand-up (if in person) to keep the meeting short and energized
> 
> Purpose:
> - Align the team on daily progress and goals
> - Identify issues early
> - Promote collaboration and quick problem-solving
> 
> Remember: The Scrum Master facilitates but doesn't lead the standup. Each team member addresses the three questions to the team, not to the Scrum Master or Product Owner.
