> [!idea] Scrum Framework
> An Agile framework for complex product development, emphasizing **iterative progress, team collaboration**, and rapid adaptation to change.
> 1. Product Backlog Creation
>    - Product Owner defines and prioritizes product backlog items
> 
> 2. Sprint Planning
>    - Team selects items from product backlog for the upcoming sprint
>    - Create sprint backlog with tasks to complete selected items
> 
> 3. Sprint Execution (usually 1-4 weeks)
>    - Daily Scrum meetings to sync team progress
>    - Team works on sprint backlog items
> 
> 4. Sprint Review
>    - Team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders
>    - Gather feedback and update product backlog if needed
> 
> 5. Sprint Retrospective
>    - Team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements
> 
> 6. Repeat steps 2-5 for next sprint

> Key aspects:
> - Self-organizing, cross-functional teams
> - Work divided into short, time-boxed iterations called Sprints
> - Regular inspection and adaptation of progress
> - Emphasis on transparency and continuous improvement

> [!example] University Club Platform Project (12-week course)
> 
> Team Composition:
> - Product Owner: Tutor/Teaching Assistant
> - Scrum Master: Rotating role among 6 students
> - Development Team: 6 students (including the current Scrum Master)
> 
> Project: Develop a club platform for the university
> 
> Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
> Total Sprints: 6 (12-week course)
> 
> Sprint 1-2: Foundation and User Authentication
> - Sprint 1 Scrum Master: Student A
> - Sprint 2 Scrum Master: Student B
> 
> Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):
> Day 1:
> - PO (Tutor): Presents initial project requirements, answers questions
> - SM (Student A): Facilitates Sprint Planning, ensures team understands the goal
> - Team: Breaks down tasks, volunteers for initial work
>   - Set up project repository and development environment
>   - Design database schema for users and clubs
>   - Begin implementing user registration and login
> 
> Day 5:
> - SM: Facilitates Daily Scrum, addresses any obstacles (e.g., development environment issues)
> - Team: Each member shares progress and plans
>   - Continue user authentication implementation
>   - Start on basic club creation functionality
>   - Begin designing UI mockups
> 
> Day 10 (End of Sprint):
> - SM: Facilitates Sprint Review and Retrospective
> - PO: Provides feedback on completed work
> - Team: Demonstrates progress, reflects on the sprint
> 
> Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):
> Day 1:
> - New SM (Student B) takes over
> - PO: Updates priorities based on Sprint 1 results
> - SM: Facilitates Sprint Planning for new goals
> - Team: Plans tasks for club management features
>   - Implement club creation and editing
>   - Develop club search functionality
>   - Create user profiles with club affiliations
> 
> Day 5:
> - SM: Runs Daily Scrum, helps resolve any team conflicts
> - Team: Updates on progress, adjusts tasks as needed
> 
> Day 10 (End of Sprint):
> - SM: Facilitates Review and Retrospective
> - PO: Evaluates progress, may adjust overall project direction
> - Team: Showcases new features, discusses improvements for next sprint
> 
> Throughout both sprints:
> - PO (Tutor): Available for guidance, ensures project aligns with course objectives
> - Rotating SM: Practices facilitation skills, ensures Scrum events occur
> - Team: Self-organizes, collaborates, focuses on delivering working features
