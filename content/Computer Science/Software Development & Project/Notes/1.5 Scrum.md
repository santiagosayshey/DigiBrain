> [!motivation] The Need for Agile Development
> In software development:
> 1. Knowledge comes from experience
> 2. Decisions are made based on knowledge
> 3. Good decisions lead to good software
> 
> However, software development faces a fundamental challenge: **comprehensive knowledge is rare** and costly to acquire.
> 
> Traditional Waterfall methods rely on extensive upfront knowledge, which is often unavailable or quickly becomes outdated. These methods typically require teams of highly skilled, experienced engineers with deep expertise in complex system architecture. Such teams are rare, expensive, and take significant time to assemble.
> 
> Agile approaches, based on empiricism:
> - **Build knowledge iteratively** through experience and observation
> - **Adapt** to changing requirements
> - Enable **good decision-making even with incomplete knowledge**
> 
> By embracing empiricism, Agile methodologies like Scrum allow teams to develop effective software in dynamic environments where perfect knowledge is unattainable.

> [!example] Waterfall vs. Agile: Handling Development Setbacks
> 
> | Setback | Waterfall Approach | Agile Approach |
> |---------|---------------------|-----------------|
> | Database scalability issue | Senior architect must foresee this in the design phase. If missed, it requires extensive rework, potentially delaying the entire project. | Team discovers the issue during a sprint. They can quickly pivot, research alternatives, and implement a new solution in subsequent sprints. |
> | Change in user requirements | Requires formal change requests, extensive documentation updates, and potential project timeline extensions. May need to revisit completed phases. | New requirements are added to the product backlog, prioritized, and incorporated into upcoming sprints. Minimal disruption to overall project flow. |
> | Technology becomes obsolete | If the chosen technology becomes outdated mid-project, it may require a complete overhaul of the design and implementation phases. | The team can gradually adopt new technology over several sprints, allowing for a smoother transition and continuous delivery of value. |
> | Budget cuts | May require significant rescoping of the entire project, potentially compromising core functionalities. | The team can reprioritize the product backlog, focusing on high-value items within the new budget constraints, delivering a viable product sooner. |
> | Key team member leaves | Can severely impact the project if the leaving member held critical knowledge. May require pausing the project to find and onboard a replacement. | The cross-functional nature of Agile teams means knowledge is more evenly distributed. The team can adapt and continue working while a new member is integrated. |
> | Integration issues with third-party services | May not be discovered until the integration phase, potentially causing significant delays and rework. | Early and continuous integration allows for quicker discovery and resolution of issues, often within the same or next sprint. |
> 
> This comparison illustrates how Agile's iterative, flexible approach allows for quicker adaptation to setbacks, while Waterfall's linear structure can make it more vulnerable to unforeseen changes and issues.

> [!idea] Scrum
> Scrum is an Agile framework that embodies empirical principles, designed to **address the challenge of developing complex products in environments where comprehensive knowledge is scarce**. It offers a flexible, iterative approach that embraces change, builds knowledge through experience, and empowers teams to deliver value incrementally. 
> 
> Scrum is founded on three pillars of empiricism:
> 
> 1. **Transparency**: Ensuring all aspects of the process are visible and understood by everyone involved.
> 2. **Inspection**: Regularly examining Scrum artifacts and progress toward goals to detect undesirable variances.
> 3. **Adaptation**: Adjusting the process, product, or materials when inspection reveals that an aspect has deviated outside acceptable limits.
> 
> | Step | Who | What | When | Why |
> |------|-----|------|------|-----|
> | 1. Product Backlog Creation | Product Owner | Defines and prioritizes a comprehensive list of features, enhancements, and fixes for the product, often in the form of user stories. Continuously refines and updates based on stakeholder feedback and market changes. | Before Sprint Planning, ongoing | To define and organize product features |
> | 2. Sprint Planning | Product Owner, Dev Team, Scrum Master | Product Owner proposes top-priority backlog items (user stories). Dev team analyzes, estimates, and selects items for the Sprint Backlog. Team collaboratively creates a Sprint Goal. Dev team breaks down selected user stories into specific tasks and creates a detailed plan for implementation. | Start of each Sprint | To select and plan Sprint Backlog items, transforming user stories into actionable tasks |
> | 3. Sprint Execution | Development Team | Implements selected backlog items (tasks derived from user stories), conducts testing, and ensures quality. Collaborates closely, adapting to challenges as they arise. Maintains a potentially shippable product increment throughout. | 1-4 weeks | To complete Sprint Backlog items |
> | 4. Daily Scrum | Development Team | Each team member briefly shares: what they did yesterday, what they'll do today, and any obstacles. Team self-organizes to address challenges and optimize progress towards Sprint Goal. | Daily during Sprint | To sync progress and plan next 24 hours |
> | 5. Sprint Review | Team and Stakeholders | Dev team demonstrates completed work (implemented user stories). Stakeholders provide feedback. Product Owner explains current Product Backlog state and projected completion dates. All collaborate on next steps to optimize value. | End of Sprint | To demonstrate work and gather feedback |
> | 6. Sprint Retrospective | Scrum Team | Team reflects on the past Sprint, identifying what went well, what could be improved, and how to implement improvements. Creates a plan for implementing changes in the next Sprint. | After Sprint Review | To reflect and identify improvements |

> These three pillars support every implementation of empirical process control in Scrum, enabling the framework to adapt to changing conditions and requirements throughout the development process.


> [!consider] Scrum Terminology
> | Term | Definition |
> |------|------------|
> | Scrum Master | Ensures that goals, scope and product domain are understood by everyone on the scrum team as well as possible. Facilitates scrum events, helps remove blocks, coaches dev team |
> | Product Owner | Maintains the vision of the project, represents the customer, owns the product backlog, prioritizes backlog items, creates acceptance criteria for user stories, and answers development team's questions |
> | Development Team | Self-organizing group of flexible non specialists that creates the product increments |
> | Sprint | Time-boxed iteration, typically 1-4 weeks long (2 weeks in SEP) where the development team implements items in the sprint backlog |
> | Product Backlog | Ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. Contains user stories, bug fixes, refactorings. Ordered in decreasing order of value and detail |
> | Sprint Backlog | Set of Product Backlog items selected for the current Sprint |
> | Daily Scrum | 15-minute daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities |
> | Sprint Review | Meeting at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog |
> | Sprint Retrospective | Opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements |
> | Increment | Sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint |
> | Task | A small, specific piece of work derived from a user story, bug report, or other backlog item. Usually carried out by one developer and typically completed within a day or less. Tasks can be technical (e.g., "Implement password reset functionality") or non-technical (e.g., "Meet with stakeholders to clarify requirements"). The key is that they are small, well-defined units of work that contribute to completing a larger backlog item |
