> [!motivation] Embracing Change: The Need for Empirical Project Management
> Traditional Waterfall project management, while structured, often depends on comprehensive upfront planning and detailed specifications. This approach typically requires extensive experience in software architecture and senior-level engineering expertise. However, it struggles with evolving requirements and can lead to delayed value delivery.
> 
> Enter empiricism in project management:
> - **Based on observable facts and real-time data**
> - Adapts to change throughout the project lifecycle
> - Easier to implement, especially for less experienced teams
> 
> **Key Takeaway:**
> 1. Knowledge comes from experience
> 2. Decisions are made based on knowledge

> [!idea] Scrum Framework
> Scrum is an Agile framework that embodies empirical principles, offering a flexible approach that embraces change and empowers teams to deliver value incrementally. It emphasizes **iterative progress, team collaboration**, and rapid adaptation to change.
> 
> 1. Product Backlog Creation
>    - Product Owner defines and prioritizes product backlog items
> 
> 2. Sprint Planning
>    - Team selects items from product backlog for the upcoming sprint
>    - Create sprint backlog with tasks to complete selected items
> 
> 3. Sprint Execution (usually 1-4 weeks)
>    - Daily Scrum meetings to sync team progress
>    - Team works on sprint backlog items
> 
> 4. Sprint Review
>    - Team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders
>    - Gather feedback and update product backlog if needed
> 
> 5. Sprint Retrospective
>    - Team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements
> 
> 6. Repeat steps 2-5 for next sprint

> Key aspects:
> - Self-organizing, cross-functional teams
> - Work divided into short, time-boxed iterations called Sprints
> - Regular inspection and adaptation of progress
> - Emphasis on transparency and continuous improvement

> [!consider] Scrum Terminology
> | Term | Definition |
> |------|------------|
> | Scrum Master | Facilitator for the Scrum Team, ensuring the Scrum framework is followed |
> | Product Owner | Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and managing the product backlog |
> | Development Team | Self-organizing group that creates the product increments |
> | Sprint | Time-boxed iteration, typically 1-4 weeks long |
> | Product Backlog | Ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product |
> | Sprint Backlog | Set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint |
> | Daily Scrum | 15-minute daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities |
> | Sprint Review | Meeting at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog |
> | Sprint Retrospective | Opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements |
> | Increment | Sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint |

> [!example] University Club Platform Project (12-week course)
> 
> Team Composition:
> - Product Owner: Tutor/Teaching Assistant
> - Scrum Master: Rotating role among 6 students
> - Development Team: 6 students (including the current Scrum Master)
> 
> Project: Develop a club platform for the university
> 
> Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
> Total Sprints: 6 (12-week course)
> 
> Sprint 1-2: Foundation and User Authentication
> - Sprint 1 Scrum Master: Student A
> - Sprint 2 Scrum Master: Student B
> 
> Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):
> Week 1:
> - Monday:
>   - PO (Tutor): Presents initial project requirements, answers questions
>   - SM (Student A): Facilitates Sprint Planning, ensures team understands the goal
>   - Team: Breaks down tasks, volunteers for initial work
>     - Set up project repository and development environment
>     - Design database schema for users and clubs
>     - Begin implementing user registration and login
> - Wednesday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting, addresses any obstacles
>   - Team: Each member shares progress and plans
> - Friday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting
>   - Team: Updates on progress, adjusts tasks as needed
> 
> Week 2:
> - Monday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting
>   - Team: Continues work, addresses any blockers
> - Wednesday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Scrum Meeting
>   - Team: Prepares for sprint end, identifies remaining tasks
> - Friday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Sprint Review and Retrospective
>   - PO: Provides feedback on completed work
>   - Team: Demonstrates progress, reflects on the sprint
> 
> Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):
> Week 3:
> - Monday:
>   - New SM (Student B) takes over
>   - PO: Updates priorities based on Sprint 1 results
>   - SM: Facilitates Sprint Planning for new goals
>   - Team: Plans tasks for club management features
>     - Implement club creation and editing
>     - Develop club search functionality
>     - Create user profiles with club affiliations
> - Wednesday & Friday: Scrum Meetings
> 
> Week 4:
> - Monday & Wednesday: Scrum Meetings
> - Friday:
>   - SM: Facilitates Review and Retrospective
>   - PO: Evaluates progress, may adjust overall project direction
>   - Team: Showcases new features, discusses improvements for next sprint
> 
> Throughout both sprints:
> - PO (Tutor): Available during class times, responds to queries via agreed communication channel
> - Rotating SM: Facilitates scheduled Scrum meetings, coordinates team communication
> - Team: Self-organizes, collaborates, focuses on delivering working features
> - Between meetings: Team communicates via messaging apps or project management tools

> [!idea] Daily Standup: The Three Questions
> 
> Daily standups, also known as daily scrums, are brief, focused meetings. They center around three key questions:
> 
> 1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
>    - Briefly summarize completed tasks
>    - Focus on work that contributes to the sprint goal
>    - Mention any significant progress or milestones
> 
> 2. What will I do today?
>    - Outline planned tasks for the day
>    - Prioritize work that moves the team closer to the sprint goal
>    - Be specific about what you intend to complete
> 
> 3. Are there any obstacles in my way?
>    - Identify any blockers or impediments
>    - Briefly describe challenges that may slow progress
>    - This is not for problem-solving, just identification
> 
> Key Points:
> - Keep responses brief and to the point
> - Focus on sprint-related work
> - The meeting should typically last no more than 15 minutes
> - It's not a status report to management, but a sync among team members
> - Stand-up (if in person) to keep the meeting short and energized
> 
> Purpose:
> - Align the team on daily progress and goals
> - Identify issues early
> - Promote collaboration and quick problem-solving
> 
> Remember: The Scrum Master facilitates but doesn't lead the standup. Each team member addresses the three questions to the team, not to the Scrum Master or Product Owner.
