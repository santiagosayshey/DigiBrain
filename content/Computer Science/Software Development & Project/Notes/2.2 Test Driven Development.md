> [!consider] Why Test Driven Development?
> Traditional software development often leads to:
> - **Bugs discovered late in the development cycle**
> - **Difficulty in refactoring or modifying existing code**
> - Incomplete test coverage
> - Code that doesn't meet all requirements
> 
> These issues can result in:
> - Increased development time and costs
> - Lower code quality and maintainability
> - Reduced confidence in the codebase
> 
> Test Driven Development addresses these challenges by:
> - Ensuring code meets specifications from the start
> - Facilitating easier refactoring and modifications
> - Providing comprehensive test coverage
> - Improving overall code design and quality

> [!idea] Test Driven Development (TDD)
> TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. It can be summarized in three steps:
> 
> 1. **Red**: Write a test that fails
>    - Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add
>    - The test should fail initially as the functionality doesn't exist yet
> 
> 2. **Green**: Make the test pass
>    - Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass
>    - Focus on making it work, not on making it perfect
> 
> 3. **Refactor**: Improve the code
>    - Clean up the code while ensuring that tests still pass
>    - Remove duplication, improve readability, optimize performance
> 
> Key principles:
> - Write only enough of a test to fail
> - Write only enough code to make the failing test pass
> - Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured
> 
> Benefits:
> - Ensures code correctness at every step
> - Encourages modular, flexible design
> - Provides regression testing as development progresses
> - Leads to more maintainable and documented code

> [!example] TDD in Action: Refactoring Procedural to Object-Oriented
> Let's implement a simple calculator using TDD, starting with procedural code and then refactoring to object-oriented.
> 
> 1. **Red**: Write a failing test for addition
> ```python
> def test_addition():
>     assert add(2, 3) == 5
> ```
> 
> 2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass the test
> ```python
> def add(a, b):
>     return a + b
> ```
> 
> 3. **Red**: Write a failing test for subtraction
> ```python
> def test_subtraction():
>     assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
> ```
> 
> 4. **Green**: Implement subtraction
> ```python
> def subtract(a, b):
>     return a - b
> ```
> 
> 5. **Red**: Write a failing test for multiplication
> ```python
> def test_multiplication():
>     assert multiply(2, 3) == 6
> ```
> 
> 6. **Green**: Implement multiplication
> ```python
> def multiply(a, b):
>     return a * b
> ```
> 
> 7. **Refactor**: Transform procedural code into object-oriented
> ```python
> class Calculator:
>     def add(self, a, b):
>         return a + b
>     
>     def subtract(self, a, b):
>         return a - b
>     
>     def multiply(self, a, b):
>         return a * b
> 
> # Update tests
> def test_calculator():
>     calc = Calculator()
>     assert calc.add(2, 3) == 5
>     assert calc.subtract(5, 3) == 2
>     assert calc.multiply(2, 3) == 6
> ```
> 
> This refactoring step encapsulates the calculator operations into a class, promoting better organization and potential for extension.
> 
> 8. **Red**: Write a failing test for division
> ```python
> def test_division():
>     calc = Calculator()
>     assert calc.divide(6, 2) == 3
> ```
> 
> 9. **Green**: Implement division
> ```python
> class Calculator:
>     # ... previous methods ...
>     
>     def divide(self, a, b):
>         if b == 0:
>             raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
>         return a / b
> ```
> 
> This process continues, adding more functionality and refactoring as needed, always ensuring all tests pass after each step.
