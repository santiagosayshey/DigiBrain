> [!consider] Why Test Driven Development?
> Traditional software development often leads to:
> - **Bugs discovered late in the development cycle**
> - **Difficulty in refactoring or modifying existing code**
> - Incomplete test coverage
> - Code that doesn't meet all requirements
> 
> These issues can result in:
> - Increased development time and costs
> - Lower code quality and maintainability
> - Reduced confidence in the codebase
> 
> Test Driven Development addresses these challenges by:
> - Ensuring code meets specifications from the start
> - Facilitating easier refactoring and modifications
> - Providing comprehensive test coverage
> - Improving overall code design and quality

> [!idea] Test Driven Development (TDD)
> TDD is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. It can be summarized in three steps:
> 
> 1. **Red**: Write a test that fails
>    - Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add
>    - The test should fail initially as the functionality doesn't exist yet
> 
> 2. **Green**: Make the test pass
>    - Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass
>    - Focus on making it work, not on making it perfect
> 
> 3. **Refactor**: Improve the code
>    - Clean up the code while ensuring that tests still pass
>    - Remove duplication, improve readability, optimize performance
> 
> Key principles:
> - Write only enough of a test to fail
> - Write only enough code to make the failing test pass
> - Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured
> 
> Benefits:
> - Ensures code correctness at every step
> - Encourages modular, flexible design
> - Provides regression testing as development progresses
> - Leads to more maintainable and documented code

> [!example] TDD in Action: Implementing a Stack
> Let's implement a simple stack data structure using TDD.
> 
> 1. **Red**: Write a failing test for pushing an element
> ```python
> def test_push():
>     stack = Stack()
>     stack.push(1)
>     assert stack.top() == 1
> ```
> This test fails because we haven't implemented the Stack class yet.
> 
> 2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass the test
> ```python
> class Stack:
>     def __init__(self):
>         self.items = []
>     
>     def push(self, item):
>         self.items.append(item)
>     
>     def top(self):
>         return self.items[-1]
> ```
> 
> 3. **Refactor**: In this case, no refactoring is needed yet.
> 
> 4. **Red**: Write a failing test for popping an element
> ```python
> def test_pop():
>     stack = Stack()
>     stack.push(1)
>     assert stack.pop() == 1
>     assert len(stack.items) == 0
> ```
> 
> 5. **Green**: Implement pop method
> ```python
> def pop(self):
>     return self.items.pop()
> ```
> 
> 6. **Refactor**: Ensure empty stack behavior
> ```python
> def pop(self):
>     if not self.items:
>         raise IndexError("pop from empty stack")
>     return self.items.pop()
> ```
> 
> This process continues, adding tests for edge cases (like popping from an empty stack) and additional functionality, always following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
