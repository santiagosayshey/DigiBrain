> [!idea] Pull Requests
> A mechanism for **proposing changes to a codebase.**
> - Developers submit changes for review before merging
> - Facilitates collaborative development and quality control
> - Integral part of the Code Review process
> 
> Pull requests are what we review during code reviews, ensuring code quality and consistency.

> [!motivation] Why Review Code?
> Imagine a scenario where untested code is pushed directly to production:
> - A critical e-commerce platform experiences frequent crashes
> - Customer data is exposed due to a security vulnerability
> - The company loses millions in revenue and faces legal consequences
> 
> Code reviews help **prevent such scenarios by catching issues early** in the development process.

> [!idea] GitHub Issues
> A tracking system for tasks, enhancements, and bugs in GitHub repositories.
> - Centralized location for project management
> - Supports labels, milestones, and assignees
> - Integrates with pull requests for traceability
> 
> GitHub Issues help teams organize work and prioritize tasks effectively. When developers **create pull requests to address specific issues, they can reference the relevant issue numbers**, creating a clear **connection between the problem and its solution.**

> [!idea] Code Reviews
> A systematic examination of source code by peers.
> - **Identify bugs, logic errors, and security vulnerabilities**
> - Ensure code quality, readability, and adherence to standards
> - Facilitate knowledge sharing among team members
> 
> Code reviews are a crucial step in the Definition of Done (DoD) for many development teams.

> [!idea] CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
> Automated processes for integrating and deploying code changes.
> - CI: Automatically build and test code changes
> - CD: Automate the deployment of verified changes
> 
> CI/CD integrates with Pull Requests and Code Reviews by:
> - Running automated tests on pull requests
> - Deploying code only after successful reviews and tests

> [!example] GitHub Code Review Process
> 1. Developer creates a new branch and makes changes
> 2. Developer opens a pull request (PR)
> 3. Reviewers are assigned or notified
> 4. Reviewers examine the code, leaving comments
> 5. Developer addresses feedback and makes changes
> 6. Reviewers approve the PR
> 7. Code is merged into the main branch

> [!consider] Static vs Dynamic Analysis
> Two complementary approaches to code analysis:
> 
> | Aspect | Static Analysis | Dynamic Analysis |
> |--------|-----------------|-------------------|
> | When   | Before execution | During runtime |
> | Checks | Syntax, style, potential bugs | Actual behavior, performance |
> | Tools  | Linters, SAST tools | Profilers, DAST tools |
> | Pros   | Early detection, comprehensive | Finds runtime issues |
> | Cons   | May report false positives | Limited to executed paths |
> 
> Both types of analysis can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for comprehensive code quality assurance.

> [!example] Communication Tools Comparison
> A comparison of communication tools commonly used by development teams:
> 
> | Aspect | Discord | Slack | MS Teams |
> |--------|---------|-------|----------|
> | Dev integrations | GitHub, GitLab, Jira via community bots | Native integrations with GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Trello, CircleCI | Native integrations with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Jira |
> | Code snippet sharing | Supports code blocks with syntax highlighting | Supports code blocks with syntax highlighting, file sharing | Supports code blocks, file sharing, collaborative editing |
> | Video calls | Up to 25 participants, screen sharing | Up to 15 participants (free), screen sharing | Up to 300 participants, screen sharing, background blur |
> | File storage | 8MB per file (free), 50MB (Nitro) | 5GB total (free), 10GB per member (paid) | 1TB per org (with OneDrive) |
> | Search capabilities | Basic search for messages | Advanced search for messages, files, and code snippets | Advanced search across messages, files, and other Microsoft 365 content |
> | Professionalism | Less formal, visible gaming activity may be distracting | Business-oriented interface | Highly professional, integrated with enterprise tools |
> | Cost | Free, with optional Nitro subscription | Free tier with limitations, paid plans for full features | Requires Microsoft 365 subscription |
> | Channels | Public and private channels | Public and private channels, shared channels between orgs | Public and private channels, shared channels between orgs |
> | Direct messaging | One-on-one and group DMs | One-on-one and group DMs | One-on-one and group chats |
> 
> Discord is popular in open-source communities, Slack in startups and mid-size companies, and MS Teams in enterprises using Microsoft services. Teams should consider their specific needs, existing tool ecosystem, and desired level of professionalism when choosing a platform.
