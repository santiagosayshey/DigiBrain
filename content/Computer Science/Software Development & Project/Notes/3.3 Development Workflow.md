> [!idea] Pull Requests
> A mechanism for **proposing changes to a codebase.**
> - Developers submit changes for review before merging
> - Facilitates collaborative development and quality control
> - Integral part of the Code Review process
> 
> Pull requests are what we review during code reviews, ensuring code quality and consistency.

> [!motivation] Why Review Code?
> Imagine a scenario where untested code is pushed directly to production:
> - A critical e-commerce platform experiences frequent crashes
> - Customer data is exposed due to a security vulnerability
> - The company loses millions in revenue and faces legal consequences
> 
> Code reviews help **prevent such scenarios by catching issues early** in the development process.

> [!idea] Code Reviews
> A systematic examination of source code by peers.
> - **Identify bugs, logic errors, and security vulnerabilities**
> - Ensure code quality, readability, and adherence to standards
> - Facilitate knowledge sharing among team members
> 
> Code reviews are a crucial step in the Definition of Done (DoD) for many development teams.

> [!idea] CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
> Automated processes for integrating and deploying code changes.
> - CI: Automatically build and test code changes
> - CD: Automate the deployment of verified changes
> 
> CI/CD integrates with Pull Requests and Code Reviews by:
> - Running automated tests on pull requests
> - Deploying code only after successful reviews and tests

> [!example] GitHub Code Review Process
> 1. Developer creates a new branch and makes changes
> 2. Developer opens a pull request (PR)
> 3. Reviewers are assigned or notified
> 4. Reviewers examine the code, leaving comments
> 5. Developer addresses feedback and makes changes
> 6. Reviewers approve the PR
> 7. Code is merged into the main branch

> [!consider] Static vs Dynamic Analysis
> Two complementary approaches to code analysis:
> 
> | Aspect | Static Analysis | Dynamic Analysis |
> |--------|-----------------|-------------------|
> | When   | Before execution | During runtime |
> | Checks | Syntax, style, potential bugs | Actual behavior, performance |
> | Tools  | Linters, SAST tools | Profilers, DAST tools |
> | Pros   | Early detection, comprehensive | Finds runtime issues |
> | Cons   | May report false positives | Limited to executed paths |
> 
> Both types of analysis can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for comprehensive code quality assurance.

> [!idea] GitHub Issues
> A tracking system for tasks, enhancements, and bugs in GitHub repositories.
> - Centralized location for project management
> - Supports labels, milestones, and assignees
> - Integrates with pull requests for traceability
> 
> GitHub Issues help teams organize work and prioritize tasks effectively. When developers **create pull requests to address specific issues, they can reference the relevant issue numbers**, creating a clear **connection between the problem and its solution.**

> [!example] Communication Tools Comparison
> Modern development teams use various tools for effective communication:
> 
> | Feature | Discord | Slack | MS Teams |
> |---------|---------|-------|----------|
> | Channels | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
> | Direct Messages | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
> | Video Calls | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
> | File Sharing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
> | Screen Sharing | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
> | Integration with Dev Tools | Limited | Extensive | Extensive |
> | Enterprise Features | Limited | ✓ | ✓ |
> 
> Each tool has its strengths, and teams often choose based on their specific needs and existing ecosystem.
