> [!motivation] Why Requirements Matter
> Imagine a software development team embarking on a **project without clear requirements**:
> - Developers interpret vague client requests differently
> - Features are built based on assumptions
> - The **final product fails to meet user needs**
> - Time and resources are wasted on unnecessary features
> - Client is dissatisfied, leading to costly revisions or project failure
> 
> This scenario highlights the need for a structured approach to understanding and documenting project needs before development begins.


> [!idea] Requirements Engineering
> Requirements engineering is the process of **defining, documenting, and maintaining** requirements in order to find out what is needed (**goals**) and the operation (**functions**) of the software.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Elicitation: **Gathering** requirements from stakeholders
> - Analysis: **Refining** and clarifying collected information
> - Specification: **Documenting** requirements formally
> - Validation: Ensuring requirements are clear, feasible, and aligned (**Validating**) with project goals
>

> 
> Benefits:
> - Provides clear project direction
> - **Reduces misunderstandings** and rework
> - Facilitates **accurate project planning** and resource allocation
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation

> [!example] Requirements Engineering Process in Action
> Scenario: Developing a mobile banking app
> 
> 1. Gather (Elicitation):
>    - Conduct interviews with bank managers, customers, and IT staff
>    - Review competitor apps and industry standards
>    - Gather user feedback through surveys
>    - Example outcome: "Users want to easily check account balances, transfer funds, and set up recurring payments"
> 
> 2. Refine (Analysis):
>    - Organize gathered information into categories (e.g., security, usability, features)
>    - Negotiate conflicting requirements with stakeholders
>    - Clarify ambiguous requirements through follow-up discussions
>    - Prioritize requirements based on importance and feasibility
>    - Example outcome: "Refined 'easy check' requirement to 'Implement account balance in clear view on home page'"
> 
> 3. Document (Specification):
>    - Write clear, concise requirement statements
>    - Create user stories: "As a user, I want to set up recurring payments so that I don't miss bill deadlines"
>    - Develop use case diagrams for key functions
>    - Document non-functional requirements: "The app shall load within 3 seconds on 4G networks"
>    - Example outcome: Comprehensive requirements document with functional and non-functional specifications
> 
> 4. Validate:
>    - Review documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy
>    - Perform feasibility analysis with the development team
>    - Create prototypes to validate user interface requirements
>    - Check for consistency and completeness across all requirements
>    - Example outcome: "Stakeholders approve requirements, development team confirms feasibility with minor adjustments"

> [!idea] Types of Requirements
> 
> | Type | Description | Key Points | Example |
> |------|-------------|------------|---------|
> | Functional | Specify system behaviors and features | - Define specific actions the system must perform<br>- Often expressed as "The system shall..." statements<br>- Directly related to use cases | The system shall allow users to transfer funds between accounts |
> | Non-functional | Define quality attributes and constraints | - Specify how well the system performs its functions<br>- Include performance, security, usability, etc.<br>- Often measurable (e.g., response time, uptime)<br>- Typically not expressed as user stories<br>- Often included in Definition of Done or acceptance criteria<br>- Provide overarching quality standards for the system | The system shall process fund transfers within 5 seconds |
> | User | Describe user goals and needs | - Often captured through user stories<br>- Format: "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"<br>- Help maintain user-centric focus | As a bank customer, I want to transfer funds between my accounts so that I can manage my finances efficiently |
> | System | Detail technical implementation | - Specify how the system will meet functional requirements<br>- Include architectural decisions, data models, etc.<br>- Often derived from functional and non-functional requirements | The system shall use a two-phase commit protocol to ensure the atomicity of fund transfers between accounts |
> | Business | Align with organizational goals | - Reflect business objectives and strategies<br>- May include regulatory compliance, market positioning<br>- Often drive high-level project decisions | The banking system shall support multi-currency transactions to facilitate international banking services |
> | Domain | Specific to the application area | - Capture industry-specific needs and constraints<br>- May require subject matter expert input<br>- Ensure system relevance in its intended context | The system shall comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for handling credit card information |
> | Interface | Define system interactions | - Specify APIs, user interfaces, and external system integrations<br>- Include data formats, protocols, and communication methods<br>- Crucial for system interoperability | The system shall provide a RESTful API for third-party applications to initiate fund transfers, using OAuth 2.0 for authentication |
> 
> Relationships:
> - User requirements often drive functional requirements
> - Non-functional requirements constrain how functional requirements are implemented
> - System requirements detail the technical implementation of functional and non-functional requirements
> - Business and domain requirements provide context and constraints for all other types
