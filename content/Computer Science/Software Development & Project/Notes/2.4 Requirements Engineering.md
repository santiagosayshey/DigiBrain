> [!motivation] Why Requirements Matter
> Imagine a software development team embarking on a **project without clear requirements**:
> - Developers interpret vague client requests differently
> - Features are built based on assumptions
> - The **final product fails to meet user needs**
> - Time and resources are wasted on unnecessary features
> - Client is dissatisfied, leading to costly revisions or project failure
> 
> This scenario highlights the need for a structured approach to understanding and documenting project needs before development begins.

> [!idea] Requirements Engineering
> Requirements engineering is the process of **defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements** in the software engineering process.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Elicitation: **Gathering** requirements from stakeholders
> - Analysis: **Refining** and clarifying collected information
> - Specification: **Documenting** requirements formally
> - Validation: Ensuring requirements are **clear, feasible, and aligned** with project goals
> 
> Benefits:
> - Provides clear project direction
> - Reduces misunderstandings and rework
> - Facilitates accurate project planning and resource allocation
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation
> 
> Types of requirements:
> - Functional: What the system should do
> - Non-functional: System qualities (performance, security, etc.)
> - Domain: Specific to the application area
