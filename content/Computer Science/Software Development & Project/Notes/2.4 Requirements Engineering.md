> [!motivation] Why Requirements Matter
> Imagine a software development team embarking on a **project without clear requirements**:
> - Developers interpret vague client requests differently
> - Features are built based on assumptions
> - The **final product fails to meet user needs**
> - Time and resources are wasted on unnecessary features
> - Client is dissatisfied, leading to costly revisions or project failure
> 
> This scenario highlights the need for a structured approach to understanding and documenting project needs before development begins.


> [!idea] Requirements Engineering
> Requirements engineering is the process of **defining, documenting, and maintaining** requirements in order to find out what is needed (**goals**) and the operation (**functions**) of the software.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Elicitation: **Gathering** requirements from stakeholders
> - Analysis: **Refining** and clarifying collected information
> - Specification: **Documenting** requirements formally
> - Validation: Ensuring requirements are clear, feasible, and aligned (**Validating**) with project goals
> 
> Benefits:
> - Provides clear project direction
> - **Reduces misunderstandings** and rework
> - Facilitates **accurate project planning** and resource allocation
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation
> 
> Types of requirements:
> 
> | Type | Description | Example |
> |------|-------------|---------|
> | Functional | Specify what the system should do | The system shall allow users to reset their password |
> | Non-functional | Define system qualities and constraints | The system shall load search results within 2 seconds |
> | User | Describe user goals or tasks to be supported | Users shall be able to filter products by price range |
> | System | Technical details of how the system will function | The system shall use HTTPS for all data transmissions |
> | Business | Derived from business goals and strategies | The e-commerce platform shall support multiple currencies |
> | Domain | Specific to the application area | The medical system shall comply with HIPAA regulations |
> | Interface | Specify how the system interacts with external systems | The application shall integrate with the PayPal API for payments |
> | Performance | Define speed, capacity, and reliability metrics | The database shall support up to 10,000 concurrent users |
> | Security | Outline security measures and access controls | User passwords shall be stored using bcrypt hashing |
> | Usability | Describe user interface and user experience requirements | The mobile app shall be usable with one hand on a smartphone |
