> [!motivation] Why Requirements Matter
> Imagine a software development team embarking on a **project without clear requirements**:
> - Developers interpret vague client requests differently
> - Features are built based on assumptions
> - The **final product fails to meet user needs**
> - Time and resources are wasted on unnecessary features
> - Client is dissatisfied, leading to costly revisions or project failure
> 
> This scenario highlights the need for a structured approach to understanding and documenting project needs before development begins.


> [!idea] Requirements Engineering
> Requirements engineering is the process of **defining, documenting, and maintaining** requirements in order to find out what is needed (**goals**) and the operation (**functions**) of the software.
> 
> Key aspects:
> - Elicitation: **Gathering** requirements from stakeholders
> - Analysis: **Refining** and clarifying collected information
> - Specification: **Documenting** requirements formally
> - Validation: Ensuring requirements are clear, feasible, and aligned (**Validating**) with project goals
>

> 
> Benefits:
> - Provides clear project direction
> - **Reduces misunderstandings** and rework
> - Facilitates **accurate project planning** and resource allocation
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation


> [!idea] Types of Requirements
> 
> | Type | Description | Key Points |
> |------|-------------|------------|
> | Functional | Specify system behaviors and features | - Define specific actions the system must perform<br>- Often expressed as "The system shall..." statements<br>- Directly related to use cases |
> | Non-functional | Define quality attributes and constraints | - Specify how well the system performs its functions<br>- Include performance, security, usability, etc.<br>- Often measurable (e.g., response time, uptime) |
> | User | Describe user goals and needs | - Often captured through user stories<br>- Format: "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"<br>- Help maintain user-centric focus |
> | System | Detail technical implementation | - Specify how the system will meet functional requirements<br>- Include architectural decisions, data models, etc.<br>- Often derived from functional and non-functional requirements |
> | Business | Align with organizational goals | - Reflect business objectives and strategies<br>- May include regulatory compliance, market positioning<br>- Often drive high-level project decisions |
> | Domain | Specific to the application area | - Capture industry-specific needs and constraints<br>- May require subject matter expert input<br>- Ensure system relevance in its intended context |
> | Interface | Define system interactions | - Specify APIs, user interfaces, and external system integrations<br>- Include data formats, protocols, and communication methods<br>- Crucial for system interoperability |
> 
> Relationships:
> - User requirements often drive functional requirements
> - Non-functional requirements constrain how functional requirements are implemented
> - System requirements detail the technical implementation of functional and non-functional requirements
> - Business and domain requirements provide context and constraints for all other types
