> [!consider] Technical Debt
> Technical debt refers to the implied **cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution** now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
> 
> Key aspects of technical debt:
> - Accumulates over time, like financial debt
> - Makes future changes more difficult and time-consuming
> - Can slow down development and increase bugs
> 
> Common sources:
> - Time pressures leading to quick fixes
> - Lack of documentation
> - Insufficient test coverage
> - Outdated dependencies
> - Poor code quality or design
> 
> Impact:
> - Decreased productivity
> - Increased maintenance costs
> - Difficulty in adding new features
> - Potential system instability


> [!idea] Refactoring: Addressing Technical Debt
> Refactoring is the process of **restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior**. It's a key strategy for managing and reducing technical debt.
> 
> Benefits of refactoring:
> - Improves code readability and maintainability
> - Reduces complexity
> - Makes code easier to understand and modify
> - Can improve performance
> 
> Best practices:
> - Refactor continuously, not as a one-time event
> - Use automated tests to ensure behavior doesn't change
> - Refactor in small, manageable steps
> - Document reasons for refactoring
> 
> Refactoring should be integrated into the development cycle, with developers addressing technical debt as part of their regular work. This proactive approach helps prevent the accumulation of excessive technical debt over time.
