> [!motivation] Why Document Requirements?
> - Ensures clear understanding between stakeholders and developers
> - Provides a reference point for project scope and goals
> - Helps in estimating resources, time, and costs
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation
> - Reduces misunderstandings and potential rework

> [!idea] Documentation
> Requirements documentation serves as an **official statement of what is required in a project.** It can take different forms:
> 
> 1. User Stories in Agile:
>    - Stored in task boards (e.g., GitHub Projects)
>    - Format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
>    - Prioritized and updated throughout development
> 
> 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
>    - Comprehensive document detailing:
>      - User requirements: What the system should do from a user's perspective
>      - System requirements: Technical specifications of how the system will meet user needs

> [!idea] Validation vs. Verification: A Scope Perspective
> The key difference between validation and verification lies in their scope:
> 
> **Validation**:
> - Broader scope
> - Focuses on the entire project or system
> - Answers: "Are we building the right product?"
> 
> **Verification**:
> - Narrower scope
> - Focuses on specific requirements or components
> - Answers: "Are we building the product, right?"
> 
> Both processes use requirements documentation, but at different levels:
> - Validation uses high-level requirements and project goals
> - Verification uses detailed specifications and technical requirements


> [!example] Validation vs. Verification
> Consider a project to build a mobile banking app:
> 
> **Validation Example**:
> - Requirement: "Users can transfer money between accounts"
> - Validation Question: Does this feature actually solve users' needs for managing their finances?
> - Process: User interviews, prototyping, beta testing
> 
> **Verification Example**:
> - Requirement: "Money transfers should complete within 5 seconds"
> - Verification Question: Does our implemented transfer function consistently meet the 5-second requirement?
> - Process: Performance testing, code reviews, system tests
> 
> Validation ensures the app meets real user needs, while verification confirms it meets specified technical requirements.
