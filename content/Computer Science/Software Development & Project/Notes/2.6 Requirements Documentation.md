> [!motivation] Why Document Requirements?
> - Ensures clear understanding between stakeholders and developers
> - Provides a reference point for project scope and goals
> - Helps in estimating resources, time, and costs
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation
> - Reduces misunderstandings and potential rework

> [!idea] Documentation
> Requirements documentation serves as an **official statement of what is required in a project.** It can take different forms:
> 
> 1. User Stories in Agile:
>    - Stored in task boards (e.g., GitHub Projects)
>    - Format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
>    - Prioritized and updated throughout development
> 
> 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
>    - Comprehensive document detailing:
>      - User requirements: What the system should do from a user's perspective
>      - System requirements: Technical specifications of how the system will meet user needs

> [!consider] Validate and Verify
> **Validation**: Ensuring we are building the right product
> - Are we meeting the actual needs of the stakeholders?
> - Does the system solve the intended problem?
> 
> **Verification**: Ensuring we are building the product right
> - Does the system meet the specified requirements?
> - Are we developing according to the documented specifications?
> 
> Requirements documentation plays a crucial role in both validation and verification processes throughout the project lifecycle.
