> [!motivation] Why Document Requirements?
> - Ensures clear understanding between stakeholders and developers
> - Provides a reference point for project scope and goals
> - Helps in estimating resources, time, and costs
> - Serves as a basis for testing and validation
> - Reduces misunderstandings and potential rework

> [!idea] Documentation
> Requirements documentation serves as an **official statement of what is required in a project.** It can take different forms:
> 
> 1. User Stories in Agile:
>    - Stored in task boards (e.g., GitHub Projects) TODO: ADD CONFLUENCE 
>    - Format: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
>    - Prioritized and updated throughout development
> 
> 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS):
>    - Comprehensive document detailing:
>      - User requirements: What the system should do from a user's perspective
>      - System requirements: Technical specifications of how the system will meet user needs

> [!consider] Validation vs. Verification: A Scope Perspective
> The key difference between validation and verification lies in their scope:
> 
> **Validation**:
> - Broader scope
> - Focuses on the entire project or system
> - Answers: "Are we building the right product?"
> 
> **Verification**:
> - Narrower scope
> - Focuses on specific requirements or components
> - Answers: "Are we building the product, right?"
> 
> Both processes use requirements documentation, but at different levels:
> - Validation uses high-level requirements and project goals
> - Verification uses detailed specifications and technical requirements

> [!example] Validation vs. Verification
> Consider a project to build a mobile banking app:
> 
> **Validation Example**:
> - Requirement: "Users can transfer money between accounts"
> - Validation Question: Does this feature actually solve users' needs for managing their finances? [Functional]
> - Process: User interviews, prototyping, beta testing
> 
> **Verification Example**:
> - Requirement: "Money transfers should complete within 5 seconds"
> - Verification Question: Does our implemented transfer function consistently meet the 5-second requirement? [Non Functional]
> - Process: Performance testing, code reviews, system tests
> 
> Validation ensures the app meets real user needs, while verification confirms it meets specified technical requirements.

> [!idea] Requirements Documentation Process
> Effective requirements documentation involves several key steps:
> 
> 1. **Define Properties**: 
>    - Who: Identify all stakeholders, from end-users to developers
>    - When: Establish project timelines and milestone deadlines
>    - Roles: Clearly define responsibilities for team members
>    - Status: Track the progress of each requirement (e.g., proposed, approved, implemented)
> 
> 2. **Define Goals**: Clearly articulate what the project aims to achieve, providing a guiding vision for all stakeholders
> 
> 3. **Define Need**: Explain the problem or opportunity the project addresses, justifying its existence
> 
> 4. **List Assumptions**: Document underlying beliefs or conditions that influence the project, helping to prevent misunderstandings
> 
> 5. **Create User Stories**: Capture requirements from the user's perspective, typically in the format "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
> 
> 6. **User Interactions and Designs**: Outline expected user experiences, possibly including wireframes or prototypes
> 
> 7. **Questions**: Compile uncertainties or areas needing clarification, promoting proactive problem-solving
> 
> 8. **Scope Limitations**: Clearly state what the project will not include, helping to manage expectations and prevent scope creep

> [!consider] Documentation Best Practices
> To ensure effectiveness, requirements documentation should:
> 
> - **Complement Task Boards**: 
>   Example: Use Confluence for detailed user stories, linking to corresponding GitHub issues
> 
> - **Remain Flexible**: 
>   Example: Use version control for documentation, allowing easy updates as requirements change
> 
> - **Serve as Information Hub**: 
>   Example: Create a centralized wiki with links to all project-related documents and resources
> 
> - **Be Unambiguous**: 
>   Example: Instead of "The system should be fast", write "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds"
> 
> - **Maintain Consistency**: 
>   Example: Use a glossary to ensure terms like "user" or "admin" have consistent meanings throughout
> 
> - **Be Verifiable**: 
>   Example: "The password reset function shall email a reset link within 30 seconds of request 99% of the time"
> 
> - **Link to Issues**: 
>   Example: In GitHub, tag issues with "REQ-001" to link them to requirement #001 in the SRS
> 
> - **Use "Shall" for Mandates**: 
>   Example: "The system shall encrypt all passwords" (mandatory) vs. "The system should support dark mode" (optional)


> [!idea] Plan-Driven Documentation Structure
> A comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) typically includes:
> 
> 1. **Preface**: Outlines document purpose, scope, and intended audience
> 2. **Introduction**: Provides project overview, objectives, and context
> 3. **Glossary**: Defines key terms and acronyms used throughout the document
> 4. **User Requirements Definition**: Describes high-level user needs and expectations
> 5. **System Architecture**: Outlines the overall structure and major components of the system
> 6. **System Requirements Specification**: Details functional and non-functional requirements
> 7. **System Evolution**: Discusses potential future changes or expansions
> 8. **Index**: Facilitates navigation through the document
> 
> This structure ensures comprehensive coverage of both user needs and technical specifications, providing a clear roadmap for development in plan-driven projects.

- requirements change, customers may come with new input, something may become infeasible, new dependency update
