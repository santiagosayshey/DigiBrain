> [!idea] User Stories in Agile Development
> User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
> 
> `As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]`.
> 
> Key aspects of user stories:
> 
> 1. **Focus on the user**: Emphasizes the person who will benefit from the feature.
> 2. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and communicate.
> 3. **Flexibility**: Can be easily modified as more is learned.
> 4. **Value-oriented**: Clearly states the benefit to the user.
> 
> Components of a good user story (INVEST):
> - **I**ndependent: Can be developed separately from other stories.
> - **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed and refined.
> - **V**aluable: Provides value to the end user.
> - **E**stimable: Can be sized relative to other stories.
> - **S**mall: Can be completed in one sprint.
> - **T**estable: Clear criteria for acceptance.
> 
> Example:
> "As a social media user, I want to be able to upload multiple photos at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently."
> 
> User stories are typically written on index cards or sticky notes and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion. They serve as the basis for sprint planning and backlog prioritization in Scrum.

This idea callout provides an overview of user stories, their structure, key aspects, components of a good user story (using the INVEST acronym), and an example. It also briefly touches on how user stories are used in the Scrum process.
