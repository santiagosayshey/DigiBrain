> [!idea] User Stories in Agile Development
> User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
> 
> `As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]`.
> 
> Key aspects of user stories:
> 
> 1. **Focus on the user**: Emphasizes the person who will benefit from the feature.
> 2. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and communicate.
> 3. **Flexibility**: Can be easily modified as more is learned.
> 4. **Value-oriented**: Clearly states the benefit to the user.
> 
> Components of a good user story (INVEST):
> - **I**ndependent: Can be developed separately from other stories.
> - **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed and refined.
> - **V**aluable: Provides value to the end user.
> - **E**stimable: Can be sized relative to other stories.
> - **S**mall: Can be completed in one sprint.
> - **T**estable: Clear criteria for acceptance.

> [!consider] Acceptance Criteria
> Effectively managing user story completion is crucial for maintaining project momentum and ensuring delivered features meet stakeholder expectations. Here are key considerations:
> 
> 1. **Acceptance Criteria**:
>    - Developed collaboratively by the Product Owner and development team
>    - Should be clear, concise, and testable
>    - Can be written in plain English or as automated tests (or both)
>    - Example: "User can select up to 5 photos, system validates file types (jpg, png, gif) and total size (â‰¤50MB)"
> 
> 2. **Definition of Done**:
>    - A shared understanding of what it means for a user story to be complete
>    - May include: code written, tests passed, documentation updated, code reviewed
> 
> 3. **Story Points**:
>    - Used to estimate the effort required to complete a story
>    - Helps in sprint planning and tracking progress
> 
> 4. **Task Breakdown**:
>    - Divide user stories into smaller, manageable tasks
>    - Helps track progress within the sprint
> 
> 5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
>    - Automate testing and deployment to catch issues early
> 
> 6. **Regular Check-ins**:
>    - Use daily stand-ups to discuss progress and obstacles
> 
> 7. **Sprint Review**:
>    - Demonstrate completed stories to stakeholders
>    - Gather feedback for potential refinements
> 
> 8. **Backlog Grooming**:
>    - Regularly refine and reprioritize stories based on new information
> 
> Remember: A user story is only complete when it meets all acceptance criteria and the team's definition of done. This ensures that the delivered feature truly meets the user's needs and maintains high quality standards.

> [!example] User Story: Online Shopping Cart Checkout
> 
> User Story:
> As an **online shopping customer**,
> I want a way to **collect items I want to buy all at once**,
> So that I only have to complete **one transaction**.
> 
> **Acceptance Criteria:**
> 
> 1. Checking Out:
>    - Given: A customer has added multiple items to the shopping cart
>    - When: They click the check-out button on the user interface
>    - Then: They are asked to complete the transaction for all the items in the cart together
> 
> 2. Checking Out Nothing:
>    - Given: A customer has not added any items to their shopping cart
>    - When: They click the check-out button on the user interface
>    - Then: An error message is displayed notifying them there is nothing in the cart
> 
> **Additional Considerations:**
> - The user interface should clearly display the number of items in the cart
> - The check-out process should show a summary of all items before final purchase
> - The system should handle various payment methods for the single transaction
> - Consider implementing a "save for later" feature for items not ready for immediate purchase
> 
> This user story focuses on improving the customer's shopping experience by allowing them to complete multiple purchases in a single transaction, while also handling the edge case of an empty cart.

> [!example] Evolution of a User Story in Scrum
> This example demonstrates how a user story might evolve throughout the development process, including adaptations to setbacks and changes in product direction.
> 
> | Stage | User Story | Notes |
> |-------|------------|-------|
> | Initial Creation | As a social media user, I want to upload multiple photos at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Product Owner creates the initial story based on user feedback. |
> | Sprint Planning | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 10 photos at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Team refines the story, adding a specific number for the first iteration. |
> | Development | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 10 photos (jpg, png) at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Developers add file type specifications during implementation. |
> | Setback | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos (jpg, png, gif) at once so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Performance issues discovered; team reduces photo limit but adds gif support. |
> | Sprint Review | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos (jpg, png, gif) at once, with a total size limit of 20MB, so that I can share my experiences more efficiently. | Stakeholders request a size limit during the review. |
> | Product Owner Change | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos or 1 short video (up to 30 seconds) at once, with a total size limit of 50MB, so that I can share my experiences more dynamically. | New Product Owner pivots to include video sharing capability. |
> | Final Implementation | As a social media user, I want to upload up to 5 photos (jpg, png, gif) or 1 short video (up to 30 seconds, mp4 format) at once, with a total size limit of 50MB, so that I can share my experiences more dynamically. | Final version of the user story after development and testing. |
> 
> This example illustrates how a user story can evolve to accommodate technical constraints, setbacks, and changing product direction while maintaining its core value proposition.


> [!idea] Definition of Done (DoD)
> The Definition of Done is a **shared understanding among the Scrum Team of what it means for work to be complete**. It ensures quality and provides a clear finish line for Sprint work.
>
> Key aspects of a good Definition of Done:
>
> 1. **Clarity**: Unambiguous and understood by all team members
> 2. **Consistency**: Applied to all user stories or backlog items
> 3. **Verifiability**: Can be checked objectively
> 4. **Completeness**: Covers all aspects necessary for a releasable increment
>
> Common elements in a Definition of Done:
> - Code written and peer-reviewed
> - Unit tests written and passing
> - Integration tests passing
> - Documentation updated
> - Code merged into the main branch
> - Acceptance criteria met
> - Product Owner approval obtained
> - Performance and security checks completed
> - No known defects that violate the release policy
>
> Benefits of a well-defined DoD:
> - Ensures consistent quality across all work
> - Reduces rework and technical debt
> - Improves transparency and predictability
> - Aligns team expectations
> - Facilitates smoother Sprint Reviews and releases
>
> The Definition of Done should be reviewed and updated regularly, often during Sprint Retrospectives, to reflect the team's growing capabilities and changing project needs.
>
> Remember: The DoD is distinct from acceptance criteria. While acceptance criteria are specific to individual user stories, the DoD applies to all work completed by the team.
