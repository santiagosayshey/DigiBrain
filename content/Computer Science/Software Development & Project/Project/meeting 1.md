| The interface must allow the user to drag and drop items to select buckets, measurements, and fields. | Is drag and drop functionality strictly necessary for mvp here? Or can we just have fields that the user can select. Something like a flow chart that expands downwards as the user selects: bucket -> measurement -> field                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |        |
|                                                                                                       | Preconditions state that the user is logged in already, are we expected to have implemented authorisation for this? Or can it just be a generic user for now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |        |
| The selected items must be accurately reflected in the query builder.                                 | Can we define accurate here? Does this mean the user should have breadcrumbs showing what they've selected so far? Should we show off the query being built as the user selects items?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |        |
| The system should be intuitive and responsive, making it easy for users to make selections.â€‹          | How can we quantify this? Should we focus on stuff like cognitive / kinematic load? Or is this something we can verify in a sprint review?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        |
| The interface must allow the user to drag and drop filters onto the selected data fields.             | Similar question to before - does this strictly have to be drag and drop?<br><br>During implementation, I think it might be a bit easier to just have a drop down menu on each field which is automatically set to the min / max for any chosen filter.<br><br>It also makes it easier to develop polymorphically. We can just define filters for fields and adjust the filter type through an overloaded function. If the user has to search various filters, they may not know which one actually works with the data they have selected.  |        |
| Users can review the code before execution                                                            | Does this mean they can leave comments? Ask for edits / explanation? Or just look at it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |        |
| Visualization of data results                                                                         | Are there any specific graph customization options we should prioritize (e.g., colors, legends, axis labels)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |        |
