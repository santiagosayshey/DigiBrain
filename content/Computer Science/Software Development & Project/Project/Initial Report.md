## Containerise!
Given our team's diverse skill sets, the our development environment using Docker containerization. This approach offers several critical advantages:

• Consistency: Ensures identical environments across all team members' setups.
• Rapid Onboarding: Each member can quickly set up their development environment.
• Isolation: Each component (frontend, backend, database) can be containerized separately.

By encapsulating our entire runtime environment, including dependencies and configurations, Docker minimizes the "it works on my machine" problem. This strategy not only streamlines our development process but also enhances collaboration and overall software quality throughout the project lifecycle.
