# Tech Stack and Standards

## Containerise!
In designing our tech stack, our primary focus is on accommodating our team's diverse skill sets through standardisation. To achieve this, we're leveraging **Docker containerization for our development environment**. This strategic decision offers several critical advantages:

• **Consistency**: Ensures identical environments across all team members' setups
• **Rapid Onboarding**: Enables quick setup of development environments using documented processes
• **Isolation**: Allows separate containerization of each component (frontend, backend, database)

Our development strategy focuses on simplicity and agility to rapidly deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). By using Docker, we address the "it works on my machine" problem, ensuring consistent environments across the team. This approach allows us to concentrate on core features and iterate quickly, embracing agile principles of flexibility and continuous improvement. Our goal is to streamline the development process, minimize setup complexities, and enable the team to respond efficiently to changing requirements as we work towards our MVP.
