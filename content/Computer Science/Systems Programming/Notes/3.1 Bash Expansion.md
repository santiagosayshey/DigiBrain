# Globbing
- Refers to *grouping* things together so that it's easier to work with lots of files at once
- Useful for:
	- searching / sorting tasks

## Wild Card *

- * means an abitrary amount of text

```bash
ls *.txt        # only lists files that end in .txt
ls *a*.txt      # only lists files that contain an 'a'
rm *            # delete every file in the current directory
```

## Wild Card ?

- The *?* character is similar to * but only works for files with ??? many characters

```bash
ls ?.txt     # will list 'a.txt' but not 'aa.txt'
ls ??.txt    # will list 'aa.txt' but not 'a.txt'
```

## Other Kinds of Globbing
- Dozens of single character wildcards

## Curly Brackets {}

```bash
touch {a..z}.txt              # will create a.txt, b.txt .... z.txt
touch {file1,file2,file3}.txt # will create file1.txt ...
touch {a..z}{a..z}.txt        # will create aa.txt, ab.txt .... az.txt, zz.txt ....
```

## Exclamation Point !
- **!** will substiute a string for it's variable name

```bash
my_var=51 
var_name="my_var" 
echo ${!var_name}
```

# Environment Variables

- Some default variables always accessable in UNIX

```bash
$HOME        #/home/username
$PATH        # The list of places where unix looks when you type something
$SHELL       # The shell program you're using (/bin/bash)
$USER        # The current user
$HOSTNAME    # The hostname of the machine the script is running on 
$RANDOM      # A random number from 0-32767
$LINENO      # The bash script's current line number
```

- Can be seen using `echo $PATH, etc`

```bash
echo $PATH
```

## $PATH

- When you type a command into the terminal, linux needs to know what that command does and tries to find it
- Linux searches all directories listed in the Path to find these commands
	- These directories are seperated by a **:** in the path
- `cd` is not in the path because it is built into the shell program


# Arithmetic

- A program is not a program without some arithmetic ( or conditionals )

## Using `let`

```bash
let a=2+2
echo $a
```

- White space sensitivity
	- Can be overcome using **" "**

```bash
let "a = 1000 * $1*"
```

## Using ``(( ))``

```bash
$(())
```

- Can parse using double brackets with **$** in front instead of using let

```bash
echo "2 + 2 is $((2 + 2))"

a=2
b=5
echo "a + b is $((a + b))"           # this is the same
echo "a + b is $(($a + $b))"         # as this  
```

## Using `expr`

- Similar to let, but does not assign to variables and does not require quotes

```bash
expr 2 + 2

a=$( expr 2 + 2 )
echo $a
```
