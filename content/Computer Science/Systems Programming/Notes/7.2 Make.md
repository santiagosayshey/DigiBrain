- Make handles dependencies and compilation

## Depdendencies
- Whenver one bit of code imports / includes / uses another bit of code, we call that a dependency
- A good programmer splits a large program into more managable seperate files - iostream, string, stdio, etc
- Program compile time is based on the number of dependencies it has
	- The problem with this is, not all the files need to be recompiled everytime something is changed
	- We can achieved this with **make**

## What Does Make Do?
- Uses date stamps to determine which files have been last modified, in which case, a modified file needs to be recompiled and vice versa
- Needs to keep track of which files have changed and which files depend on those changed files

### Make Basics
- File must be called `Makefile` with no extension
- Call `make` within that directory

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230426120445.png]]

- This reads as:
	- Make a file called `myExe` from `myCode.c` (gcc command)
	- Do this if someone types `make my_exe`
	- Only do something if `myExe` is older than `myCode.h `or `myCode.c,` otherwise do nothing

- Red is target
	- Allows you to have multiple make commands inside a single Makefile
	- Typing make by itself will call the first make command
- Blue are dependencies
	- List of files needed for compilation
	- If all files are unmodified, the green part does not happen, otherwise it will be compiled
- Green is compilation instructions ( can be any system / bash commands )

```bash
clean:
	rm *.o my_exe

my_exe:
	gcc my_code.c -o my_exe
```

- White space matters ( tab spaces for compilation instructions )

### Default Make
- Should always use the first make command (the default one) as `usage` output

```bash
nothing:
	echo “make clean: remove all files” 
	echo “make bucket: compile bucket” 
	echo “make build: compile all” 
	echo “make deploy: move files around”

...
```

### Layered Dependencies
- So far, make is no different than having a bunch of compile instructions in a bash file ( that only executes iff the files have been modified)
- The real benefit lies in layered examples

```bash
clean: 
	rm *.o my_exe 
	
my_exe: driver.o quack.o 
	gcc driver.o quack.o –o my_exe 
	
driver.o: driver.cpp 
	gcc –c driver.cpp 
	
quack.o: quack.cpp quack.h 
	gcc –c quack.cpp

```

- Prior to attempting to make `my_exe` it will try to make `driver.o` and `quack.o` (if they're not already files)

```bash
gcc –c quack.cpp
```

- `-c` creates a kind of interim compilation file, called an object file (instead of an executable)
	- These object files can be linked together in a file compilation to create an execuitable

#### Example Compilation
1. We change `quack.h`
2. We run `make my_exe`
3. Check dependencies
	1. `driver.o` has not been changed (nor has it's dependencies) and doesn't need to be recompiled
	2. `quack.o` is older than `quack.h`, so we need to recompile `quack.o`
4. `my_exe` is no longer older than it's dependencides and we can compile it

### Dependency Tree
- Highest node is main.c

## Custom Make File
- Doesn't need to be called Makefile if you use `-f` flag

```bash
make -f <custom_makefile_name> <parameter>
```


## Make Shortcuts

### Target Shortcuts `$@`
- Make will automatically identify $@ as a Make Shortcut and replace it with `my_target`

```bash
my_target: my_dependency 
	gcc my_dependency -o $@
```


### Prerequisite Shortcut `$^`
- Make will automatically identify $^ as a Make shortcut and replace it with ‘my_dependency1 my_dependency2’ (i.e. the target). This can be handy… for some compilation instructions… sometimes. Such as:

```bash
my_exe: file1.c file2.c file3.c 
	gcc $^ -o $@
```

- Doesn't work with `.h` files

#### First Prerequesite `$<`
- Same as regular, but only includes the first dependency

```bash
my_exe: file1.c file2.c file3.c 
	gcc $< -o $@
```

- Will only include file1.c


### Wild Card `*`
- Globbing files together like in bash

```bash
my_target: my_*.c 
	gcc $^ -o $@
```

### Multiple Targets
- Can use multiple targets with the same rule

```bash
target1 target2: 
	# Do stuff
```

### Wildcard `%`
- Useful for similar files with similar compilation instructions

```bash
my_target_%.o: 
	my_%.c gcc $^ -o $@
```

- Kind of like globbing in bash, but for compiling

### Macros
- Are basically shell variables

```bash
CC=gcc 
my_exe: main.c file1.o, file2.o 
	$(CC) $^ -o $@ 
file%.o: file%.c file%.h 
	$(CC) –c $<
```

- At runtime, `gcc` will be replaced with `CC`
