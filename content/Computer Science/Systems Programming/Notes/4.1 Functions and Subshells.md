 # Functions

- Bash functions work like regular Bash scripts
	- Can use them with arguments

- A basic function in C++ that computes something

```cpp
int sum(int a, int b) {
	return a+b;
}

int main() {
	a = sum(1,1)
}
```

- We would expect sum to return a value of 2 and store that value inside of a
- This is different in bash, the return value is the entirety of the standard output from the ENTIRE function

```bash
a=$(ls)
echo $a
```

- Where a is the entire output of the ls function

## Return / Exit
- Use `exit` to return the state of the function
	- `exit 0` means everything went well
	- `exit 1+` means something went wrong
- Useful in `if statements` or `while loops`
- We can use `$?` to get the exit status of the last executed instruction

```bash
a=$(ls)
echo $?
echo $?
```

- We can see that `$?` is replaced with the LAST updated executed instruction, including ones that have nothing to do with that specific function

## Bash vs C

- In C / C++, 0 means false, while everything else means true
- In Bash, 0 means success, while everything else means failure

```bash
if ./bash_script; then
	# do stuff
fi
```

- If `./bash_script` successfully executes and will return 0, meaning the if statement will be true and can execute # do stuff

## Local Variables

- Scope does not exist in Bash, variables created inside of functions, also exist outside of the function
- In other words, bash has ENTIRELY global variables
- We can fix this blasphemy by calling function variables as `local`

```bash
function thisIsBash()
{
	a=1
	local b=2
}

c=$(thisIsBash)

echo $a
echo $b
```

- `echo $a`, in C++, this would print nothing, but in Bash, this would print 1
- `echo $b` will print nothing since b is local to the function

# Subshells

```bash
a=$(ls)
```

- This code invokes a subshell

## Processes and Process IDs

- Two environment variables which are useful for understanding subshells

```bash
$PPID    # The current process ID (each process has a unique ID)
$BASH_SUBSHELL # The current bash subshell level
```

## Testing Subshells

```bash
echo “test1” 
a=$(echo “test2”) 
echo $a
```

- This will echo test1, then echo test2
- What about:

```bash
echo “test1 $PPID” 
a=$(echo “test2 $PPID”) 
echo $a
```

- This will do the same, but also echo the PPID of each line ( PPID will be the same because it is the same process )
- What about:

```bash
echo “test1 $BASH_SUBSHELL” 
a=$(echo “test3 $BASH_SUBSHELL; 
	”b=$(echo “test3 $BASH_SUBSHELL”); 
	echo $b) 
echo $a
```

- Will get down to subshell #2

#### OK, but what are Subshells?
- Functions, but unlike functions, they have their own scope
	- Variables defined within a subshell are not accessible by the parent

```bash
a=$(b=1)
echo "$b"
```

- This prints nothing! 
- `b` is defined in th subshell and thus, cannot be accessed outside of it
- This is very confusing but also very useful
