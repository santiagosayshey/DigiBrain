## Pipes and Redirection
- Pipes are a form of redirection that exists between programs

## Pipes in Bash
- Use the `|` symbol between two function calls
``
```bash
ls | wc -l
```

- This will redirect the output of `ls` into `wordcount` and output the number of lines to stdout

## Pipes in C

### Under the Hood
- For a pipe to work in C, you need a buffer (bit queue) where the output of one program can sit while the other program reads it
- Requires file descriptors to determine who can read / write
	- Stored in a two element `int` array `int[2] arr`
	- The first element is the reading file descriptor
	- The second element is the writing file descriptor

### Reading and Writing Operations
- The writer will write until the buffer is full
- The reader will read until the buffer is empty
- The reader must think it's standard in is the file descriptor defined by `pipe[0]`
- The writer must think it's standard out is the file descriptor defined by `pipe[1]`

```c
// writer
close(pipe[0]);    // A writer does not read 
dup2(pipe[1], 1);  // Standard out is now the pipe write end c
close(pipe[1]);     // Close the pipe file-descriptor (it’s is 
			       // already stdout)
exec

// reader
close(pipe[1]);    // A reader does not write 
dup2(pipe[0], 0);  // Standard in is now the pipe read end 
close(pipe[0]);    // Close the pipe file-descriptor (it’s is 
			       // already stdin) 
exec
```

### Pseduo Pipe

```c
int main()
{
	// Setup
	char * commands[2]; // Child Commands
	commands[0] = “ls”;
	commands[1] = NULL;
	
	char * commands[2]; // Parent Commands
	commands2[0] = “wc”;
	commands2[1] = NULL;
	
	char test_buffer[100]; // For printing
	
	// Fork and Pipes
	int my_pipe[2]; // pipe
	if (pipe(my_pipe) == -1) 
		perror(“Cannot create pipe\n”);
	
	pid_t my_pid; // Fork
	my_pid = fork();

	// Error
	if (my_pid < 0) 
		printf(“Failed Fork\n”);
	
	
	// Parent
	if (my_pid > 0) {
		close(my_pipe[1]);
		dup2(my_pipe[0], STDIN_FILENO);
		close(my_pipe[0]);
		wait(NULL); // wait for child
		execvp(“wc”, commands2);
	}
	
	// Child
	else // I.e. my_pid == 0
	{
		close(my_pipe[0]);
		dup2(my_pipe[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
		close(my_pipe[1]);
		execvp(“ls”, commands);
	}
}
```

which is just `ls | wc` in bash

### Pipe Restrictions
- Limited capacity
- Must split things into manageable chunks
