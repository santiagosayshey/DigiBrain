## kill
- What does **kill** do?

```bash
kill -TERM
kill -STOP
kill -CONT
```

- These either end, or pause a process, by sending a **signal** to said process

### Ctrl-C (aka SIGINT)
- Let's you regain control of a terminal by ending an infinite program
- It's a shortcut for `signal interrupt`
	- it ends the currently running process in the terminal
- There other shortcuts to pause or send EOF characters, but not all of these are signals

## How Do Signals Work?
- Are generated from the CPU
- Each of the 32 bit integers of an OS represent a signal. 
- There are such integers because each integer represents a different thing
	- Pending Signals
	- Blocked Signals

### Pending Signals, Blocked Signals
- Once a user has flagged the OS to generate a signal, the OS will update the **pending** signals list
- If both the pending and blocked list are checked, nothing happens
- If a signal is pending, but not blocked, it executes the signal handler in the code

### Standard Signals

### Signal Handling
- Must return `void` and take an `int`
	- The int is a reference is a reference to the type of signal that happened
- Need to setup signal, then call it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void handler(int num)
{
	write(STDOUT_FILENO, "Thwarted!\n", 13);
}

int main() {
	signal(SIGINT, handler);
	while (1)
	{
		printf("Do Nothing\n");
	}
```

- An infinite loop that is immune to SIGINT (Ctrl-C)

- A single signal handler can be used to setup as many signals as one wants

```c
signal(SIGINT, handler); 
signal(SIGFPE, handler); 
signal(SIGPIPE, handler); 
signal(SIGSTOP, handler); 

void handler(int in_signal) 
{ 
	if (in_signal == SIGINT) {} 
	if (in_signal == SIGPIPE) {} 
	... 
}
```

#### Things Not to Do in Signal Handlers
- Do NOT use malloc, it will almost always cause a memory leak
- Do NOT use printf - can cause the wrong this to be displayed or crash program (accessing the buffer from two parts of the code at once)
- These functions are not **async signal safe**

#### When Signal Handlers Fail
- A few signals that can't be handled and attempts will be denied

```c
SIGKILL or kill -kill
SIGSTOP or Ctrl-Z
```

- The OS needs to have control over what processes can run on it

#### User Defined Signals

```c
SIGUSR1
SIGUSR2
```

- These have no predefined behavior
- A good use would be to signal two programs to dock with each other when they are ready to interact

#### Predefined Signal Redirects
- In order to reset signals back to their original purpose:

```c
signal(<some_signal>, SIG_DFL);
```

- Assign no code to a signal, AKA do nothing

```c
signal(<some_signal>, SIG_IGN);
```

### Ok, But Why Use Signals?
- Addresses the idea of synchronous vs asynchronous behaviour
- For example, if I have a device which is slow to function, but I want it to have low latency, asynchronous behaviour is needed

#### Polling vs Interrupts
- In a synchronous system, a CPU will continually check when something is connect. This is a waste of CPU time
- It is much more efficient to use signals to tell the CPU that something has happened

#### Hardware Signals
- Hardware also has signals, called interrupts
	- Printer goes online, mouse / keyboard is connected
	- Kind of like an exception, but unlike them, interrupts are intentional functionality 
- In UNIX, a hardware interrupt causes the CPU to start executing a kernal exception handler
- In some cases, it must defer the exception handling operation to the faulting process
	- Achieved via the signal mechanism, wherein the kernal sends to the process a signal corresponding to the current exception

##### Divide By Zero Example
- What happens when a process demands the result of 1/0 from the CPU?
- The program will crash, a core dump as the CPu sends the program a floating point error `SIGFPE`
- For this to work, define what the CPU needs to do
	- Save the context (program counter, save registers, stack)
	- Consult a table of things to do (which interrupt handler to call)
	- Resolve the interrupt's default behaviour
	- Business as ual (reload registers)
- The **interrupt service handler** also has responsibilites
	- Do stuff after the signal is called
	- Do code stuff
	- Set flags
	- etc

### Signal Dont's
- Do NOT use SIGSEGV or SIGFPE for any other reason than helping to debug your error
- Doing so will cause an infinite loop between program and signal handler

### Signal Timing
- Signals be crazy
- They are NOT atomic and can therefore fire irregardless of each other. 
- the `sigprocmask()` function can be used to block and unblock signals
- There are no definitive answers to handling this, only some possibilities:

#### Last In, First Out (Stack Style)
- Whatever the most recently called signal is, it get's resolved first
- Interrupts of interrupts

#### Ignore It
- If two signals are the same, pretend the others didn't happen

#### Block and Queue
- When you recieve an extra signal, block and queue the new one.
- Ready to recieve new signals, but you don't interrupt the current signal

##### The Flaws of Blocking
- What happens if you block a signal during a signal handler?

```c
handle_sigint() {
	// BUT WHAT HAPPENS HERE???
	signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN);
	// stuff
	signal(SIGQUIT, prev_Handler);
}
```

- This will ignore `SIGQUIT` and handle `SIGINT`
- SIGQUIT could trigger but before the signal direction occrs

### Signal Ambiguity
- Don't always have clear meanings
- `SIGFPE` can occur for many reasons
- `SIGSEGV` is only useful for telling you your code sucks


### Sigaction
- Since signals are a mess, use sigaction

```c
int sigaction(signalnumber, action, prevaction);
```

- Where:
	- `signalnumber` : The signal to redirect
	- `action` : is a struct (type `sigaction`) containing the handler
	- `prevaction` : Can be `NULL` but basically used to store the previous action (allowing some control)

- `sigaction` contains: 
	- `sa_handler` : Another struct • 
		- Can be set to a few options 
			- IGN: Ignore
			- DLF: Default 
			- handler: Custom function 
	- `sa_sigaction` : • You can set this to the name of a handler which will get not only the number (i.e. SIGINT) but some extra context for the signal 
	- `sa_flags `: • Used to tell system whether you want to use old-style (no info) or new style (with info) you set a bit in sa_flags 
	- `sa_mask `: • Used to define the set of signals to block

## Moustrap and it's Problems
- Everytime a mouse get's caught in a mousetrap, the moustrap needs to be reset
- What happens if another mice comes along before it's reset
- In essence, this is the issue with signals
