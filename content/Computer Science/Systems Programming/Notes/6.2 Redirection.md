- Simplest form of redirection is:

```bash
ls > temp.txt
```

## Streams

- In order to understand `> or <`, we have to understand streams
- Usually defined as an arbitrary stream of characters in some sort of sequence
- Streams can be absorbed (input) or produced (output)
- Unix has default streams, each come with a file descriptor

## File Descriptors
- A connection from a process to a file
- Identified by a unique number
- Each process has a list of its file descriptors
- A simple way to think about it:
	- Each program needs to know what files it has a relationship with and what relationship it is
	- This is managed via file descriptors
- Individual processes do not have direct access to files
	- The kernel stores a filetable which then refers to anINode table

### OK, but what is Redirection then?

- A process has access to some file descriptors, which refer to some streams
- Instead of reading from standard in stream, you rad from a file somewhere
	- This is the general essence of redirection

#### C Example of Redirection


```c
#include <stdio.h> // For writing
#include <fcntrl.h> // For <we’ll see>

int main()
{
	int fd; // This will be important later
	char line[100]; // Somewhere to store things
	
	fgets(line, 100, stdin);
	printf(“%s”, line); // Read and print
	
	fgets(line, 100, stdin);
	printf(“%s”, line);
	
	fgets(line, 100, stdin);
	printf(“%s”, line);

	// stdin just disappeared
	close (0);

	fd = open(“<a path>”, 0_RDONLY); // <= This is a flag

	// Die gracefully if file doesn’t exist
	if (fd != 0)
	{
		fprintf(stderr, “Could not open data as fd 0\n”);
		exit (1);
	}
	
	fgets(line, 100, stdin);
	printf(“%s”, line); // Read and print x3
	
	fgets(line, 100, stdin);
	printf(“%s”, line);
	
	fgets(line, 100, stdin);
	printf(“%s”, line);
	
	return 0;
}
```

- Broken into 4 main parts:

1. Read some stuff from standard in, then print it out
2. Close standard in ( 0 is the file descriptor for standard in)
3. Open a file in read only mode as a stand in for standard in (also check if it worked)
4. Read from the file (rather than standard in) and print the result to the screen

### dup2
- `dup2` is a function to ensure correct copying of file descriptors
- It duplicates file descriptors

```c
dup2(old_fd, new_fd);
```

### File Descriptors and Exec group of Functions
- FD's can last through calls to exec

```c
int main()

{

	int id;
	id = fork();
	
	if (id == 0);
	{
		// Child
		{
			close(1);
			fd = creat (“ls_output”, 0644);
			execlp(“ls”, “ls”, NULL);
			perror(“execlp”);
			exit(1);
		}
	}
	else if (id != 0)
	{
		// Parent
		wait (NULL)
	}
}
```

- Normal fork, splitting into two different paths.
- In the parent, wait
- In the child, close stdout and open a file
	- The file will take FD: 1 (stdout)
	- Now when execlp runs 'ls', the output of 'ls' will go to the file we created
