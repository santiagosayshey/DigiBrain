## Process
- A thread of execution currently running on an operating system
- Each clock cycle, the operating system will have to think about the currently running processes

## Program
- A series of instructions that do something useful when followed in order
- A computer can read a program line by line, executing each instruction

### Program vs Process
- Once a program decides to begin the execution of a program, it becomes a process
- The process is the act of reading a program line by line
- Possible to pause a process
- Two processes can be running from the same program
- Think of it like a recipe in the kitchen
	- The recipe is the program
	- The head chef is the operating system
	- Each kitchen hand is a different process
	- The process is the 'making of the recipe'

## Processes in Unix
- View unix processes

```bash
ps
```

- This shows only the processes currently running in the terminal
- A more useful command:

```bash
ps -a
```

- Shows all the current processes running on the machine and their corresponding ID
- Another more detailed command is:

```bash
top
```

- This is more akin to task manager in windows
- Also shows PPID ( parent process ID ), allows the OS to establish rules about what happens when a parent process dies
	- At the top of the heirachy is the `init` process, which has a PID of 1
	- Responsible for collecting **orphan processes**


### Executing Programs in Unix 
- Run it like a bash command

```bash
./my_program.ext
OR
ls, cd, grep, etc
```

- Another alternative is `system`

#### System Commands
- Effectively calls unix commands in sequence within a C program
- The C prorgram must wait for the system command to finish before executing its next command

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main () { 
	char command[50]; 
	strcpy( command, "ls -l" ); 
	system(command); 
	return(0); 
}
```

#### Exec Commands
- What if you wanted to run a unix command and C and not wait for it to finish executing?
- Functions for this:

```C
int execvp(const char * path, char * const argv[]);
```

- Unlike system, execvp starts a new process, but simultaneously ends the current process
- Jumps from one program to another, whereas `system` is like calling a program like a function
- The `argv` parameter must contain the name of the executable, and must be called with a second argument, even if the executable doesnt take arguments
	- Use `NULL` in this case

## Forking
- The process of turning one process into two, where the second process is a copy of the first
- The key difference is that the fork ( the function that forks the program ), will return different values to the parent and child
	- Child will return 0
	- Parent will return a non zero number
- Program pattern:
	- Execute
	- Fork
	- Replace child with another program (via execvp)
	- Use parent to wait for child to finish

```c
while (TRUE)

{
    read_command(command, params);
    pid= fork();
    
    // Imagine two different programs executing from here
    if (pid < 0) // fork failed
    {
	    handle_error();
    }

    else if (pid> 0) // parent process, waits for child to finish
    {
	    wait(NULL);
    }

    else // child process, executes command and finishes
    {
	    execvp(command, params);
    }
}
```

- `wait(NULL)` commands the parent to wait for the child
