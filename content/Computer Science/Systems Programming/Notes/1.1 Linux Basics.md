## Operating Systems / UNIX

* Low level software designed to interface programs and devices / running programs
* In UNIX, everything is a file
	* Files are files
	* Directories are files (a list of files)
	* Executables are files
	* Devices are files


## Navigation

- Linux uses foward slashes
- Each directory starts with \, this just means base
- Use `cd` to change the current working directory
	- use `cd ..` to change to the parent directory
	- use `cd .` in addition with other commands to perform some sort of function with the current directory
	- use `cd /` to change to the root directory (the parent of all directories)


## File Permissions

* Each unique user on a machine has an ID
* IDs are used to determine whether or not a user has access to a file or not
* There can exist groups of these IDs, which themselves may have specific file permissions

- Three types of permissions
	- Read - can view the contents of the file
	- Write - can change the contents of the file
	- Execute - can treat the file like a program

- Changing permissions can be done with:

``` bash
chmod -[type of permission] [file]
```

```bash
+r will allow read
+w will allow write
+x will allow execute

-r will stop read
-w will stop write
-x will stop execute
```

#### Example

- Allow execute permission to the file my_script.sh

```
chmod +x my_script.sh
```


## The Kernel

- *The Kernel* is the base program of the operating system
	- Interfaces the CPU, memory. peripherals with applications
	- Manages things like files, users, devices and processes

## Processes

- A program is a series of instructions written by a programmer
	- A process is the execution of such a program

- Each process is associated with a user, such that their is a process heirachy
	- If a parent process dies, so will any of it's child processes. This is mostly true but not always the case

- The kernel is the parent of all processes, it's the head chef of the operating system

## The Shell

- The shell is just another process
	- An interactive process designed to run other processes, similar to the kernel


## Basic UNIX Commands

| Command | Description                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ls      | list the contents of the current directory           |
| cp      | copies a file from one location to another           |
| mv      | moves a file from one locatation to another          |
| rm      | deletes files                                        |
| pwd     | output the current working directory                 |
| cd      | change the current working directory                 |
| less    | show me a bit of the specified file                  |
| cat     | concatenate two files                                |
| grep    | find the files which contain some specific text      |
| head    | output the start of a file                           |
| tail    | output the end of a file                             |
| wc      | how many lines / words / characters are in this text |
| ps      | what processes are running                           |
| kill    | stop a process                                       |
| cut     | grab certain parts from a file for some purpose      |
| paste   | glue files together vertically                                                     |

`Examples`
```bash
cp test test2
```

- Will copy the contents of test to test2

```bash
mv test test2
```

- Will move the contents of test to test2 and delete test 

```bash
cat test test2
```

- Will add the contents of test2 to the end of test

```bash
paste test test2
```

- Will add the contents of each line in test to each respective line test2

```bash
cut test -c 5
```

- Will print the 5th character of each line in test

```bash
grep wan *.sh
```

- Find all shell files in the current directory that contain "wan"

## Redirection

- Direct the output of a previous command into a new command

- read from a file
``` bash
script.sh < file.txt
```

- save to a file
``` bash
script.sh > file.txt
```

## Piping

- Similar to redirection, can be use to chain commands together
- Use the output of the previous command as the input in the next command

```bash
ls | wc -l
```

- take the output of ls and count the number of lines and output that

## C and UNIX

- Special relationship with UNIX as UNIX was written in C
- C can use UNIX commands within it's own code
- Very low level, meaning it can easily interact with the system
