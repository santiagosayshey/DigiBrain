## Static Members

Static members represent shared properties between all the objects in the class.  
- Can be data or functions
- Initialized outside the class
- Are invoked independent of **OBJECTS** and do not contain a ‘this’ pointer. This means they exist without having to declare an object and exist entirely within the class

```c++
using namespace std;
#include <iostream>

class Student
{
    private:
        int id;
        static int count;
       
    public:
        Student()
        {
            id = Student::count++; // increment each time a student is created because count is static
        }

        int getID()
        {
            return id;
        }

        static int getCount() // must return a static int, can't return a regular int, ie id
        {
            return Student::count;
        }
};

int Student::count = 1; // has to be defined outside the class

int main()
{
    cout << Student::getCount() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Utility Classes

Utility classes have only static methods that perform some operation on the objects passed as arguments.  
- Typically don't have data members
