## Overloading
Separate functions share the same name with different signatures.

## Overriding
One function in the child replaces another with the same name and signature in the parent.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class A {
    protected:
        int _s;
    public:
        A(int s): _s(s) {}
        A(): A(-1) {}

        void add(int j) {
            _s += j;
        }
        // overloading the add function by changing the parameter type
        void add(double j) {
            _s += static_cast<int>(j);
        }
        void print() {
            cout << "S = " << this->_s << endl;
        }
};

class B : public A {
    private:
        double _k;

    public:
        B(int s, double k): A(s), _k(k) {}
        B(): B(0, 0) {}

        // overriding the function
        void print() {
            cout << "S = " << this->_s << " K = " << this->_k << endl;
        }
};
```

## Polymorphism
The same entity behaves differently in different scenarios.  
Builds upon inheritance.  
Implemented using virtual functions.

## Static Binding
The compiler matches a function call with the correct functions definition at compile time.

## Late Binding
Tells the compiler to wait until the function is used in the program.  
Decide which definition to use based on calling object.  
Declare a function with the keyword `virtual` if you want the compiler to use dynamic binding for that specific function.

```cpp
class A {
    protected:
        int _s;
    public:
        A(int s): _s(s){}
        A():A(-1) {}
        // runtime polymorphism
        virtual void print() {
            cout << "S = " << this->_s << endl;
        }
};

class B : public A {
    private:
        double _k;
   
    public:
        B(int s,double k):A(s), _k(k) {}
        B():B(0,0) {}
        // overriding the function
        void print() {
            cout << "S = " << this->_s << " K = "<< this->_k << endl;
        }
};

void test(A* a) {
    a->print();
}

int main() {
    A a1(564);
    B b1(500, 0.123);
    test(&a1);
    test(&b1);

    return 0; 
}
```

### Example Compilation Outputs

- With `virtual` keyword:
```
g++ main.cpp -o main.out
./main.out
S = 564
S = 500 K = 0.123 // switches to overridden print function from derived class
```

- Without `virtual` keyword:
```
g++ main.cpp -o main.out
./main.out
S = 564
S = 500 // still uses the original parent print function
```

## Virtual Functions
- Define a virtual function in the base class. The word `virtual` appears ONLY in the base class.
- If a base class declares a virtual function, it must implement that function, even if the body is empty.
- Virtual functions stay virtual in ALL the derived classes.
- A derived class is not required to override a virtual function. If it does not, the base class version is used.

## Disadvantages of Virtual Functions
- Overhead: uses more storage as the compiler needs to build a virtual function table.
- Has pointers for each virtual member function.
- Points to location of correct code for that function.
- Late binding is on the fly so programs run slower.

Certainly! Below is the continuation of your notes in Markdown format, starting from "Default Copy Constructor" as requested:
## Default Copy Constructor
In addition to the no-arguments default constructor:
- Initializes an object with another object of the same type.
- Built into all classes.
- One-argument constructor whose argument is an object of the same class as the constructor.
- Used when we pass and return objects to functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Point {
    private:
        int _x;
        int _y;
    public:
        Point(): _x(0), _y(0) {}

        void print() { cout << _x << ", " << _y << endl; }
        void set_point(int x, int y) { _x = x; _y = y; }
};

// this COPIES p1 to pnt, it does not update p1
Point foo(Point pnt) {
    pnt.set_point(500, 500);
    pnt.print();

    return pnt;
}

int main() {
    Point p1;
    p1.set_point(10, 10);
    p1.print();

    // default copy constructor
    Point p2 = p1;
    p1.print();

    // this COPIES p1 to pnt, it does not update p1
    foo(p1);
    p1.print();

    // this COPIES p1 to pnt, then sets p1 as pnt as the return value
    p1 = foo(p1);
    p1.print();

    return 0;
}
```

## Shallow vs Deep Copy
- In shallow copies, an object is created by simply copying the data of all variables of the original object.
- No issues unless the data members are pointers (will only copy address).
- In deep copies, an object is created by copying data as well as allocating new memory resources to store the dynamically allocated data members.

## Virtual Destructors
- Base class destructors should always be virtual.
- If the base class destructor is not virtual then `delete` keyword will delete the base class and not the derived class.

```cpp
class Point {
    private:
        int* _x;
        int* _y;
    public:
        Point() {
            _x = new int;
            _y = new int;
            *_x = 0;
            *_y = 0;
        }

        // new copy constructor to fix dynamic arrays
        Point (const Point &pnt) {
            _x = new int;
            _y = new int;
            *_x = *(pnt._x);
            *_y = *(pnt._y);
        }
        // needed to copy over
        void operator=(const Point &pnt) {
            *_x = *(pnt._x);
            *_y = *(pnt._y);
        }

        void print() { cout << *_x << ", " << *_y << endl; }
        // need virtual
        virtual void set_point(int x, int y) { *_x = x; *_y = y; }

        // default destructor . added virtual to use new overridden destructors
        virtual ~Point() {
            delete _x;
            delete _y;
            cout << "_x and _y were deleted\n";
        }
};

class Point3D : public Point {
    private:
        int* _z;
    public:
        Point3D() : Point() {
            _z = new int;
        }
        void set_point(int x, int y, int z) {
            Point::set_point(x, y);
            *_z = z;
        }
        // virtual destructor
        ~Point3D() {
            delete _z;
            cout << "_z was deleted\n";
        }
};

int main() {
    Point* p = new Point3D;

    // this uses default destructor because destructor is not virtual
    delete p;
    //p->set_point(10, 10, 10);

    return 0;
}
```
