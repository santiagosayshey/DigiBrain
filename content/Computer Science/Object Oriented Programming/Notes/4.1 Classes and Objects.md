## Classes vs Objects

**Class** - User defined data type whose variables are objects  
**Objects** - Have variables and functions  
An object is a runtime instantiation of a class

### Encapsulation

Combining variables and functions into a single object which belongs to a class

### OOP Design 101

- Start from a description of requirements
- Identify nouns as objects and their data members
- Identify verbs as interactions between objects
- Identify hierarchy of objects
- Identify object responsibilities

### Example Use Case

Write a program to manage the students' record in a classroom. Each student has a unique ID, name, and grade. The program should be able to:
- Print all the students in the classroom
- Find the grade of a student based on their ID
- Update the grade of a student
- Write the studentâ€™s records to a file
- Read the records from a file

#### Steps

1. From the design, identify the classes
2. Define the classes in code
3. Give states and behaviours
4. Instantiate objects from classes
5. Give variables to states and behaviours
6. Invoke their behaviour

#### Classes

- Students
    - ID
    - Name
    - Grade
- Classroom

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    private:
        string name;
        int ID;
        double grade;

    public:
        Student(string s_name, int s_ID, double s_grade) {
            name=s_name;
            ID=s_ID;
            grade=s_grade;
        }

        // behaviours
        // get
        string get_name() {return name;}
        int get_ID() {return ID;}
        double get_grade() {return grade;}
        // set
        void set_name(string new_name) {name = new_name;}
        void set_grade(double new_grade) {grade = new_grade;}
};

int main() {
    Student s1("Sam", 1799298, 100);
    s1.set_name("Dan");

    cout << s1.get_name() << endl;
    cout << s1.get_grade() << endl;
    cout << s1.get_ID() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### States

- Name
- ID
- Grade

#### Behaviours

- Set/Get states

#### Private Members

- All data/functions cannot be directly accessed in the program except within the definition of a member function

### Constructors

- Function of a class - has the same name as the class
- Called automatically when a class is declared
- Used to initialize objects
- A default constructor that does nothing is always automatically generated if you don't define one
- Multiple constructors can be declared (discussed later)

### Member Function Definitions

Declare functions in public behaviours and define them later (or in another file with headers and cpp files)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    private:
        string name;
        int ID;
        double grade;

    public:
        Student(string s_name, int s_ID, double s_grade) {
            name=s_name;
            ID=s_ID;
            grade=s_grade;
        }

        // declaration
        bool is_pass();
};

// definition of function
bool Student::is_pass() {
    if (grade > 50) 
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}
```

My apologies for any misunderstanding. I'll continue from where the examples were trimmed and provide the complete code. Below are the rest of the examples, including the sections on Pointers to an Object, Arrays of Objects, and Destructors.

### Pointers to an Object

This section shows how to define a pointer that contains the address of an object.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int ID;
    double grade;

    Student(string s_name, int s_ID, double s_grade) {
        name = s_name;
        ID = s_ID;
        grade = s_grade;
    }

    string get_name() { return name; }
};

int main() {
    Student s1("Sam", 1799298, 100);
    Student* p = &s1;
    cout << p->get_name() << endl; // prints "Sam"
    cout << s1.get_name() << endl; // prints "Sam"

    Student *p_new = new Student("Sam", 123, 23.9);
    cout << p_new->get_name() << endl; // prints "Sam"

    return 0;
}
```

### Arrays of Objects

This section shows that we can define an array of objects similar to an array of built-in data types like `int`. We can create a new dynamic array of objects using the `new` operator.

```cpp
class Student {
    // ... (same as previous example)
};

int main() {
    Student a1[10];  // array of 10 students
    Student* a2[10]; // a pointer to an uninitialized array
    Student* a3 = new Student[10]; // pointer to an array of 10 students

    return 0;
}
```

### Destructors

Member function of a class that is called automatically when an object of the class goes out of scope or a pointer to the object is deleted. It's used to eliminate dynamic variables that have been created by the object so that the memory occupied is returned. It can also perform other cleanup tasks as needed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int ID;
    double grade;

    Student(string s_name, int s_ID, double s_grade) {
        name = s_name;
        ID = s_ID;
        grade = s_grade;
    }

    ~Student() {
        // Destructor
        cout << "Student object is being deleted" << endl;
    }

    string get_name() { return name; }
};

int main() {
    Student* p_new = new Student("Sam", 123, 23.9);
    cout << p_new->get_name() << endl; // prints "Sam"

    delete p_new; // Destructor will be called and message will be printed

    return 0;
}
```

In this last example, when we use the `delete` operator on `p_new`, the destructor for the `Student` object is automatically called, which prints the message "Student object is being deleted" in this case.

These examples should now provide a more comprehensive view of how to work with objects, pointers to objects, arrays of objects, and destructors in C++.
