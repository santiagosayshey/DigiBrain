> [!motivation] Why Docker?
> - **Consistency issues**: Applications behaving differently across environments.
> - **Deployment complexity**: Difficulty managing dependencies and configurations.
> - **Resource inefficiency**: Need for a lighter alternative to full virtual machines.
> - **Scaling challenges**: Complications in quickly scaling applications.

> [!idea] Docker: Images and Containers
> Docker simplifies application deployment using containers created from image templates.
> 
> - **Images**: Read-only templates for containers.
>   - Contain application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
>   - Reusable and shareable across different environments.
>   - Can be versioned and stored in registries.
> 
> - **Containers**: Running instances of images.
>   - Provide isolated environments for applications.
>   - Disposable and can be quickly created/destroyed.
>   - Multiple containers can run from the same image.
> 
> **Key Concept**: Images provide the blueprint, containers bring that blueprint to life.



> [!example] Developer's Docker Workflow: Solving Environment Inconsistencies
>
> **Problem**: Developing a Python web application across a diverse team
> - Team members use different OSes: Windows, macOS, various Linux distributions
> - Inconsistent Python versions and package dependencies cause "works on my machine" issues
> - Need for a consistent development environment across the team
>
> **Solution**: Use Docker to create a consistent development environment
>
> 1. **Define the application environment**
>    - Python 3.9
>    - Flask web framework
>    - PostgreSQL database
>
> 2. **Create a Dockerfile**
> ```dockerfile
> FROM python:3.9
> WORKDIR /app
> COPY requirements.txt .
> RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
> COPY . .
> CMD ["python", "app.py"]
> ```
>
> 3. **Build the Docker image**
> ```bash
> docker build -t mywebapp:v1 .
> ```
>
> 4. **Run the container for development**
> ```bash
> docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 mywebapp:v1
> ```
> - `-v $(pwd):/app` mounts the current directory to allow real-time code changes
> - `-p 5000:5000` maps the container's port to the host
>
> 5. **Develop and test**
> - Make changes to the code on the host machine
> - Changes are immediately reflected in the running container
> - Test the application by accessing `http://localhost:5000`
>
> 6. **Version control and sharing**
> - Commit code changes to version control (e.g., Git)
> - Push the Docker image to a registry for team access:
>   ```bash
>   docker push myregistry.com/mywebapp:v1
>   ```
>
> 7. **Team collaboration**
> - Other developers can pull and run the exact same environment:
>   ```bash
>   docker pull myregistry.com/mywebapp:v1
>   docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 myregistry.com/mywebapp:v1
>   ```
>
> **Result**: 
> - Consistent development environment across all team members, regardless of their local OS
> - Eliminates "works on my machine" problems
> - Simplifies onboarding of new team members
> - Ensures that all developers are using the same versions of Python and dependencies
