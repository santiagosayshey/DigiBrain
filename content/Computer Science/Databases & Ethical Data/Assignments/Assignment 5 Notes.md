1. What ChatGPT is

```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 are artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots or large language models built by [OpenAIExternal link](https://openai.com/), which allow people to interact in a conversational way. They use natural language processing (NLP) to generate conversations and respond with relevant answers that mimic human speech

GPT stands for ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer’, which refers to how these bots process requests and formulate responses.

ChatGPT and GPT-4 are also available as APIs or application programming interfaces that can be integrated into other apps and online services.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to an engineered system that generates
predictive outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations, or decisions
for a given set of human-defined objectives or parameters without explicit
programming. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of
automation.
Machine learning are the patterns derived from training data using machine
learning algorithms, which can be applied to new data for prediction or
decision-making purposes.

Generative AI models produce novel content such as text, images, audio, video
and code in response to prompts.
A large language model (LLM) is a type of generative AI that specialises in the
generation of human-like text.
Multimodal Foundation Model (MfM) is a type of generative AI that can
process and output multiple data types (e.g. text, images, audio)

AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating
intelligent machines that can think and act like humans. AI
systems are designed to learn from their environment and
make decisions based on the data they receive. AI can be used
to solve complex problems, such as medical diagnosis,
autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing.


There are several types of AI, including machine learning,
deep learning, and natural language processing. Machine
learning is a type of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data
and make predictions. Deep learning is a type of machine
learning that uses neural networks [4] to process data. Natural
language processing (NLP) is a type of AI that uses
algorithms to understand and generate human-like
conversations

ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) system developed by Open AI

```
AI is an umbrella term and broad field that refers to the creation of intelligent systems
capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem
solving, and decision making[8]. Artificial intelligence is the intelligence exhibited by artificial
entities to solve complex problems, and these systems are generally considered computers or
machines. Intelligence is the ability to think, imagine, remember, understand, recognize
patterns, make choices to adapt to change, and learn from experience. Artificial intelligence
that makes computers behave more like humans and in much less time than humans. That is
why it is called artificial intelligence[9]. AI algorithms are used in various fields because they
can process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions beyond the
capabilities of human thinking[10].
ChatGPT is a powerful conversational AI system using deep learning [11]. It is one of the AI-
based conversational programs that can generate human-like responses[10]. Until now,
conversational AI has often misunderstood what people say. Humans do not have perfect
command of grammar and spelling, and due to the nature of language, the difference in
interpretation is very wide, so there are many cases in which a person gives a written answer
or cannot answer at all, so its utilization is extremely limited except for short answers [12].

However, ChatGPT did a lot of learning in the language part, applied the best AI, memorized
the context of the speech and previous conversations, and reached the level of understanding
even if it was spoken roughly like a conversation. It has the ability to not only generate natural
language responses from questions posed in natural language, but also predict the direction of
the current conversation[13]. In particular, it has the ability to provide personalized dialogue
and language responses based on the different conversation styles of individual users [14].
ChatGPT can learn and analyze massive amounts of linguistic data from various sourc es and
generate output in a human-like way. Unlike conventional AI, which simply analyzes objects and
identifies patterns, ChatGPT can create new and unique objects and effects, making it a
powerful generative AI[15].
The working process of ChatGPT can be divided into two types, query and response, as shown
in <Figure 1>[16]. The device behind ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence supercomputer. The
computer is trained on a large data set with numerous parameters. This supercomputer is
trained unsupervised to identify patterns in input data by determining the statistical structure
within the data. In general, users can write queries to ChatGPT. This query is sent directly to the
supercomputer. Queries are now processed on supercomputers. The output generatio n circuitry
generates possible outputs and then fine-tunes the output data. Then instruct ChatGPT to
respond. Finally, ChatGPT, a conversational interface, interacts with humans by providing
human-like responses.
Helberger(2023) argues that ChatGPT, a generative AI system, differs from ‘traditional’ AI
systems in at least two important ways: dynamic context and scale of use[17]. Generative AI
systems are not built for specific situations or conditions of use, and their openness and ease
of control allow them to be used on an unprecedented scale. The output of generative AI
systems is virtually indistinguishable from human-generated content, as they are trained using
almost anything available on the web[18]. It can also be interpreted as media(text, audio, video)
by people with common communication skills, significantly lowering the threshold for who can
be a user. And they can be used for a certain amount of versatility because of the sheer volume
of data extraction that goes into training. ChatGPT alone contains 300 billion words, spanning
all kinds of content available on the Internet, from personal data to policy documents, news
reports, literary texts and art

```
2. What it does
   
```
Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 can chat with you, answer follow-up questions, challenge incorrect information and perform tasks such as writing text and generating code and other outputs.

ChatGPT can only provide answers based on the information it has been trained with and does not have the ability to search the internet for new information. However, GPT-4 (the latest language model from OpenAI) can be connected to the internet via plugins, giving it the power to search for information and datasets online

ChatGPT and GPT-4 are used for: content sharing, encrypted, gaming, in-app purchasing, location sharing, messaging/online chat, screen capture and voice chat.

It is designed to generate human-like conversations by understanding the context of a conversation and generating appropriate responses

It is able to understand the context of a conversation and generate appropriate responses. It can also generate responses in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German. Additionally, ChatGPT is able to generate responses in different styles, such as formal, informal, and humorous.

3. A short history of large language models
   
```
1. **Early Beginnings**:  
- "The research in this field can be traced back decades ago. We can mark the beginning of research in the field of generative AI in the 1960s, when Joseph Weizenbaum developed the chatbot ELIZA, one of the first examples of an NLP system."
  
2. **Challenges and ANNs**:   
- "However, we know that modern generative AI is a subfield of DL and, although the first Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were first introduced in the 1940s, researchers faced several challenges, including limited computing power and a lack of understanding of the biological basis of the brain."
  
3. **Backpropagation and Training**:
- "By the 1980s... the advent of the backpropagation algorithm facilitated the training phase of ANNs. Indeed, before the advent of backpropagation, training Neural Networks was difficult because it was not possible to efficiently calculate the gradient of the error with respect to the parameters or weights associated with each neuron, while backpropagation made it possible to automate the training process and enabled the application of ANNs."
  
4. **Generative Models - VAEs**:  
- "In 2013, Kingma and Welling introduced a new model architecture in their paper Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes, called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). VAEs are generative models that are based on the concept of variational inference... The key innovation of VAEs is the introduction of a probabilistic interpretation of the latent space."
  
5. **Introduction of GANs**:  
- "Only 1 year later, GANs were introduced by Ian Goodfellow... During training, the generator tries to create data that can fool the discriminator into thinking it’s real, while the discriminator tries to become better at distinguishing between real and fake data."
  
6. **Transformers and Large Language Models**:   
- "Another great milestone was achieved in 2017 when a new architecture, called Transformer, was introduced by Google researchers... Transformers were indeed the foundations for massive language models called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), introduced by Google in 2018, and they soon become the baseline in NLP experiments. Transformers are also the foundations of all the Generative Pre-Trained (GPT) models introduced by OpenAI, including GPT-3, the model behind ChatGPT."
  
7. **Generative AI Going Mainstream**:
- "Not by chance, 2022 has been dubbed the year of generative AI. This was the year when powerful AI models and tools became widespread among the general public... Once generative AI models have been widespread to the public, every individual user or organization had the possibility to experiment with and appreciate its potential, even without being a data scientist or ML engineer."

GPT-3: A set of models that can understand and generate natural language. GPT-3 has been trained on a large corpus of text and can perform a wide range of natural language tasks such as language translation, summarization, question-answering, and more. Here is an example:

GPT-3.5: This is a newer set of models that build upon GPT-3 and aim to improve its natural language understanding and generation abilities. GPT-3.5 models can perform complex natural language tasks such as composing coherent paragraphs or essays, generating poetry, and even creating computer programs in natural language. GPT-3.5 is the model behind ChatGPT and, on top of its API, it is also consumable within the Playground with a dedicated UI:

4. How ChatGPT was trained and where that data came from
   
```
Both models have been trained with huge amounts of data and use human feedback and reward models to rank the best responses.

ChatGPT is based on a deep learning model called GPT-3, which is trained on a large dataset of conversations.

https://www.esafety.gov.au/key-topics/esafety-guide/chatgpt-and-gpt-4
```

```
For example, a language model such as GPT-3, developed by OpenAI, can be trained on large amounts of text data and then used to generate new, coherent, and grammatically correct text in different languages (both in terms of input and output), as well as extracting relevant features from text such as keywords, topics, or full summaries.

Valentina Alto - Modern Generative AI with ChatGPT

```
We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.

To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this process.

ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. You can learn more about the 3.5 series [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers). ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 were trained on an Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.

https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt
```

![](docs/Images/ChatGPT_Diagram.svg)

```
Pre-training Approach:
"Our basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [RWC+19 ], with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training."

Learning Within the Context:
"Our use of in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for learning within the context."

Different Training Settings:
"Specifically, we can identify at least four points on this spectrum: Fine-Tuning (FT), Few-Shot (FS), One-Shot (1S), and Zero-Shot (0S)."

Model and Architecture:
"We use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 [ RWC+19 ], including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer [ CGRS19 ]."

Training Dataset:
"Datasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset2 [RSR+19 ] constituting nearly a trillion words."
"However, we have found that unfiltered or lightly filtered versions of Common Crawl tend to have lower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets: (1) we downloaded and filtered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference corpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy and preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overfitting, and (3) we also added known high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity."
"For the third, we added several curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [ RWC+19], collected by scraping links over a longer period of time, and first described in [KMH+20], two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia."

Concerns about Data Contamination:
"A major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large models with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by having their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training."

Brown, T., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J.D., Dhariwal, P., Neelakantan, A., Shyam, P., Sastry, G., Askell, A. and Agarwal, S., 2020. Language models are few-shot learners. _Advances in neural information processing systems_, _33_, pp.1877-1901.

## 300 billion words. How many are yours?

ChatGPT is underpinned by a large language model that requires massive amounts of data to function and improve. The more data the model is trained on, the better it gets at detecting patterns, anticipating what will come next and generating plausible text.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, fed the tool some [300 billion words](https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/gpt-3/) systematically scraped from the internet: books, articles, websites and posts – including personal information obtained without consent.

If you’ve ever written a blog post or product review, or commented on an article online, there’s a good chance this information was consumed by ChatGPT.

## So why is that an issue?

The data collection used to train ChatGPT is problematic for several reasons.

First, none of us were asked whether OpenAI could use our data. This is a clear violation of privacy, especially when data are sensitive and can be used to identify us, our family members, or our location.

Even when data are publicly available their use can breach what we call [contextual integrity](https://digitalcommons.law.uw.edu/wlr/vol79/iss1/10/). This is a fundamental principle in legal discussions of privacy. It requires that individuals’ information is not revealed outside of the context in which it was originally produced.

Also, OpenAI offers no procedures for individuals to check whether the company stores their personal information, or to request it be deleted. This is a guaranteed right in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)) – although it’s still under debate whether ChatGPT is compliant [with GDPR requirements](https://blog.avast.com/chatgpt-data-use-legal).

This “right to be forgotten” is particularly important in cases where the information is inaccurate or misleading, which seems to be a [regular occurrence](https://www.fastcompany.com/90833017/openai-chatgpt-accuracy-gpt-4) with ChatGPT.

Moreover, the scraped data ChatGPT was trained on can be proprietary or copyrighted. For instance, when I prompted it, the tool produced the first few passages from Joseph Heller’s book Catch-22 – a copyrighted text.

- _Analytics_: We may use a variety of online analytics products that use cookies to help us analyze how users use our Services and enhance your experience when you use the Services.

## 2. How we use personal information

We may use Personal Information for the following purposes:

- To provide, administer, maintain and/or analyze the Services;

https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
```

```
Finally, OpenAI did not pay for the data it scraped from the internet. The individuals, website owners and companies that produced it were not compensated. This is particularly noteworthy considering OpenAI was recently [valued at US$29 billion](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsofts-%2410-billion-investment-in-openai%3A-how-it-could-impact-the-ai-industry-and-stock), more than double its [value in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2023/01/05/chatgpt-creator-openai-discussing-offer-valuing-company-at-29-billion-report-says/?sh=f2ca73b11e04).

OpenAI has also just [announced ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/), a paid subscription plan that will offer customers ongoing access to the tool, faster response times and priority access to new features. This plan will contribute to expected [revenue of $1 billion by 2024](https://www.reuters.com/business/chatgpt-owner-openai-projects-1-billion-revenue-by-2024-sources-2022-12-15/).

None of this would have been possible without data – our data – collected and used without our permission.

## A flimsy privacy policy

Another privacy risk involves the data provided to ChatGPT in the form of user prompts. When we ask the tool to answer questions or perform tasks, we may inadvertently hand over [sensitive information](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/01/27/generative-ai-chatgpt-can-disturbingly-gobble-up-your-private-and-confidential-data-forewarns-ai-ethics-and-ai-law/?sh=5d7dd7ce7fdb) and put it in the public domain.

For instance, an attorney may prompt the tool to review a draft divorce agreement, or a programmer may ask it to check a piece of code. The agreement and code, in addition to the outputted essays, are now part of ChatGPT’s database. This means they can be used to further train the tool, and be included in responses to other people’s prompts.

Beyond this, OpenAI gathers a broad scope of other user information. According to the company’s [privacy policy](https://openai.com/privacy/), it collects users’ IP address, browser type and settings, and data on users’ interactions with the site – including the type of content users engage with, features they use and actions they take.

It also collects information about users’ browsing activities over time and across websites. Alarmingly, OpenAI states it may [share users’ personal information](https://openai.com/privacy/) with unspecified third parties, without informing them, to meet their business objectives.

6. What any ethical issues are
   
```
ChatGPT and GPT-4 have certain limitations, as OpenAI makes clear, including sometimes writing answers that sound believable but are factually inaccurate, giving biased responses and the risk that they may action inappropriate or harmful requests.

https://www.esafety.gov.au/key-topics/esafety-guide/chatgpt-and-gpt-4
```

```
Biases & Limitations:
"Another limitation is that ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human language, and as a result it may produce responses that contain biased or offensive language."
"One major limitation is that it is only able to generate text based on the input provided to it, and it does not have access to external information or the ability to browse the internet."

Deng, J. and Lin, Y., 2022. The benefits and challenges of ChatGPT: An overview. _Frontiers in Computing and Intelligent Systems_, _2_(2), pp.81-83.
```

```
1. "The rapid advancement of AI technologies brings forth a plethora of ethical considerations and challenges that must be carefully addressed to ensure their responsible and equitable deployment. Some of them are listed here:"
    
2. "Data privacy and security: As AI systems rely heavily on data for their learning and decision-making processes, ensuring data privacy and security becomes paramount. In Chapter 9, we already saw how Microsoft addressed the topic of data privacy with Azure OpenAI Service, in order to guarantee the Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) and security practices expected of the Azure cloud. However, this data privacy topic also affects the data that is used to train the model in the first instance: even though the knowledge base used by ChatGPT to generate responses is public, where is the threshold of the consent of involved users whose information is used to generate responses?"
    
3. "Bias and fairness: AI models often learn from historical data, which might inadvertently introduce biases. Addressing bias and fairness in AI systems involves the following:  Diverse datasets: Ensuring that training data is diverse and representative of various demographics can help reduce biases in AI models  Algorithmic fairness: Developing algorithms that prioritize fairness and do not discriminate against specific demographic groups is essential  Monitoring and auditing: Regular monitoring and auditing of AI systems can help identify and rectify biases, ensuring that the outcomes are equitable."
    
4. "Transparency and accountability: As AI systems become more complex, understanding their decision-making processes can be challenging. This involves the following two important aspects:  Explainable AI: Developing AI models that can provide clear explanations for their decisions can help users understand and trust the system.  Responsibility and liability: Establishing clear lines of responsibility and liability for AI systems is crucial to hold developers, organizations, and users accountable for the consequences of AI-driven decisions."
    
5. "The future of work: AI-driven automation has the potential to displace jobs in certain sectors, raising concerns about the future of work. Throughout this book, we have seen how ChatGPT and OpenAI models are able to boost productivity for individuals and enterprises. However, it is also likely that some repetitive tasks will be definitively replaced by AI, which will impact some workers. This is part of the change and development process, and it is better to embrace change rather than combat it. Some actions in this direction could be reskilling and upskilling programs – governments, organizations, and educational institutions should invest in reskilling and upskilling programs to help workers adapt to the changing job market and acquire new skills required for emerging roles."

```
1. "Therefore, the ethical issues of ChatGPT, a powerful conversational artificial intelligence, should be analyzed based on the moral competence of people involved in the development and use of ChatGPT."
2. "Despite these numerous benefits, ChatGPT may have a negative impact on human life[26]. Therefore, we have a task to carefully consider and solve the ethical problems of ChatGPT technology."
3. "Ethical issues of ChatGPT that are expected in the future can be largely classified into six categories as follows."
4. "A problem with using ChatGPT for higher education assessment is the potential for plagiarism."
5. "In addition, ChatGPT may generate responses that violate intellectual property rights such as copyright or patent law[29]."
6. "ChatGPT provides easy scripting and coding access to cybercriminals, effectively reducing the barriers to entry in this space."
7. "Third, if the data used to train the language model includes biased representations of a specific group of individuals, social stereotypes and unfair discrimination may occur."
8. "Fourth, there are risks of data security involved in interacting with ChatGPT."
9. "Fifth, another ethical problem with ChatGPT is that it has the potential to reduce users' critical thinking[36]."
10. "Sixth, when people start to rely on machines to communicate, genuine human relationships can be lost[40]. So relying on ChatGPT for conversations can be ethically questionable."
11. "Ethical evaluation of ChatGPT technology can be made based on four components of moral competence: moral identity, moral sensitivity, moral judgment, and moral practice."
12. "First, ChatGPT provides moral advice despite its lack of morality. In other words, ChatGPT's advice affects the user's moral judgment."
13. "Second, users do not understand the information that ChatGPT generates or judge its accuracy or relevance."
14. "Third, ChatGPT, a large-scale language model, is a statistical model, not an ethical reasoning[44]."

7. What any possible legal issues are
   
```
They may also infringe intellectual copyright by incorporating content without permission and not attributing content.

https://www.esafety.gov.au/key-topics/esafety-guide/chatgpt-and-gpt-4
```

```
Security Concerns:
"One major concern is the risk of adversarial attacks, in which an attacker attempts to manipulate the model by providing malicious inputs that cause it to produce incorrect or undesirable outputs."
"ChatGPT's ability to generate human-like text raises the risk of impersonation and identity theft."

Misinformation & Propaganda:
"Another concern is the potential for ChatGPT to be used to spread misinformation or propaganda, particularly if it is integrated into platforms that have a wide reach such as social media."

Deng, J. and Lin, Y., 2022. The benefits and challenges of ChatGPT: An overview. _Frontiers in Computing and Intelligent Systems_, _2_(2), pp.81-83.
```

```
1. **Data Privacy and User Information**: Concerns have been raised about the extent to which ChatGPT and similar models store or recall personal data. This has implications for data privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.
    
2. **Misinformation**: Given that ChatGPT can generate text based on its training data, there's potential for it to spread misinformation, either intentionally or unintentionally. This can have legal ramifications, especially if it leads to real-world harm.
    
3. **Intellectual Property**: As AI-generated content becomes more commonplace, there will be questions about who owns the rights to this content. Can an AI model infringe on copyright? Who owns the rights to AI-generated content: the user, the developers, or no one?
    
4. **Impersonation and Identity**: Advanced AI models can, in theory, impersonate a certain writing style or generate text that seems like it's coming from a specific individual. This brings up legal concerns about impersonation, fraud, and identity theft.

- Data anonymisation: Replace or alter personal information in the text using information that cannot be linked to the individual.
- Data masking: Replace personal information in the text, such as email addresses or phone numbers, with fictional data that retains the same format.
- Include only relevant data: Choose only information that is relevant.

verify and edit AI generated content to ensure accuracy and suitability of the output

Writing a clear and effective prompt can greatly improve the quality of output from generative AI tools, while also reducing errors or irrelevant responses. Provide clear roles and examples when creating a prompt, which involves defining a character and role for the AI tool, giving a clear task, providing examples and additional guidelines, specifying the type of output required, and including any extra phrases to improve the prompt. These steps help the AI model understand the task more accurately and produce results that meet the required specifications.

To prevent hallucinations, some good practices should be kept in mind: 

• Be specific and clear: Make sure your prompt is well-defined and clearly states what you are looking to achieve. This will help the model generate more focused and relevant responses. A prompt such as Tell me about the world would probably not generate great results. 

• Provide sufficient context: The more context you can provide, the better the model will be able to understand what you are looking for and generate a response that is relevant to your needs. 

• Avoid ambiguity: Avoid using vague or ambiguous terms or phrases in your prompt, as this can make it difficult for the model to understand what you are looking for. 

• Use concise language: Keep your prompts as concise as possible, while still providing enough information for the model to generate a response. This will help ensure that the model generates focused and concise responses. 

• Be mindful of the training data: ChatGPT has been trained on a large corpus of text, and it may generate responses that are biased or inaccurate based on the patterns in that data. Be mindful of this and consider adjusting your prompts if you suspect that the model is generating responses that are not appropriate or accurate.
