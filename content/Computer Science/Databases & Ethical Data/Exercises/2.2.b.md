## Prompt

```
You have two experiments. One throws 1000 dice one time and puts all the results into a string. The other throws 1 die one thousand times and puts all the results into a string.
```

## Questions

```
1. In the second experiment, the die only has the value 5 on it. What is the entropy?
```

0, we are always getting 5 and there is no unknown randomness

 2. In either case are the dice outcomes independent events or not? Explain
```

Yes, they are. One dice throw does not depend on any previous dice throw - i.e. the probability for each outcome is the same every single time

3. What is the information content of a 6 showing up on a die?
