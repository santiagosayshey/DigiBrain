## Prompt
```
I have a box of 100 balls. 40 have only a red stripe, 40 have only a blue stripe, 20 have both red and blue stripes. Let's assume I can't see into the box.
```

## Questions
```
1. I pull a ball from the box, What is the probability that is has only a red stripe?
```

There are 40 balls with only a red stripe out of a total of 100 balls. So the probability is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%

```
2. I put that first ball back into the box and pull another ball. What is the probability that it has at least a blue stripe?
```

Here, the balls with at least a blue stripe would include those with only a blue stripe (40 balls) and those with both blue and red stripes (20 balls). That's a total of 60 balls out of 100. So the probability is 60/100 = 0.6 or 60%.


```
3. I replace the ball and mix again. I pull the ball and a friend says it has least a red stripe. What is something I now know with 100% certainty?
```

If the ball has at least a red stripe, then it cannot be a blue stripe only ball.
