- CAP Theorem
	- We may have to settle for stale data to keep the system going
- EC says that we achieve high availability in distributed systems by allowing that at some point, every participant will agree upon the value of given data
- Referred to as BASE
	- Basically available
	- Soft State
	- Eventually consistent
- How?
	- Anti entropy - Exchanging versions between servers
	- Reconciliation - Choosing an appropriate final state
- This is a liveness issue, not a safety issue

##### Examples

```
Strong eventual consistency (SEC) adds the safety guarantee that two nodes which receive the same set of updates in any order will be the same state. How is this a safety guarantee?
```

- Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) provides a safety guarantee by ensuring that all nodes in a distributed system will converge to the same state after receiving the same set of updates, regardless of the order of those updates. This consistency leads to data integrity, predictability, and reliability across the entire system, even in the face of network issues and differing update sequences.

```
Reconciliation can be carried out in many different ways. Assume that a system has timestamps that can show the time of transaction against some central system clock. If you had multiple transactions writing to the same location, use timestamps to propose the two different ways to decide which transaction has won.
```

- The transaction with the earlier timestamp gets to write and the other results in an error
- The transaction with the later timestamp gets to write and the other results get reverted back
