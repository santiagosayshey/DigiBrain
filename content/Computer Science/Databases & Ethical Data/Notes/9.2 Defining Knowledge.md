## What is Knowledge?
- Justified true belief (JTB)
	- Truth is the state of agreeing with the facts or reality
	- Belief is something that a person holds to be true
	- Justification is the reason that someone holds a belief
- Is this enough?

##### Example - A Cow
- I observe a shape on the hill
- I believe it to be a cow because it is cow shaped and dark
- The shape is a cow - WRONG
	- The hill is covered in cow shaped, dark objects that are not cows but rocks
	- The shape `I happened to look at` is a cow
	- This is the Gettier Problem - while the belief is true and justified, it is only true by accident

> *Cogito ergo moo?*
> I think therefore I moo
> I moo therefore I am cow

## Responses to Gettier Cases
- No false premises

```
Suppose a person looks at a broken clock and believes it is a certain time because the clock shows that time. The belief may be true and justified (the clock could be right by coincidence), but because it is based on a false premise (that the clock is working), this approach would say the person does not have knowledge.
```

- Reliabilism

```
If a person has a true belief about the weather because they consistently and accurately interpret meteorological data, reliabilism would say this counts as knowledge because the method (interpreting meteorological data) is reliable.
```

- Indefeasibility Condition

```
Suppose someone believes there is a sheep in the field based on seeing a white, fluffy object in the distance, and it turns out there is indeed a sheep behind a tree in the field. The person’s belief is true and justified, but because they would have withdrawn their justification had they known the white, fluffy object was a dog, the indefeasibility condition would say they do not have knowledge.
```

## Philosophy of Science
- Science is a formalised form of the acquisition of empirical knowledge
- In this context, empirical knowledge is that gathered by experiment and observation, rather than the less formal "experience"

## Knowledge Sharing in Science
- We share discoveries in science as widely as possible to:
	- Provide a foundation for further science
	- To allow for confirmation
	- To allow for refutation
	- To build a chain of provenance that allows discoveries to be traced back to their foundations

## Attribution
- Scientific discoveries are attributed to the scientists or groups who are recorded as discovering them
- This is not always the person who discovered them
- This can have a bias towards the dominant group in society
- Some knowledge is kept secret because of its value
- What determines value?

##### Examples

1. 
```
You're working in a materials lab and discover a way to produce clean water with a cheap and simple graphene philtre. Will you publish this and what is your reasoning?
```

- Absolutely I will publish this. It could potentially improve the quality of life for many people. Some might refute this knowledge and claim that it worsens the quality of the water and save lives. Some might take this knowledge and improve upon it, making it even more cheap and simple. 


2. 
```
We come across some notes in an old library book that shows you how to produce clean water using a cheap graphene layer. Although the note was written before graphene became feasible to produce so the unknown author has written "nice idea but won't work on it". How do you think this information would be published? Explain what you're assuming about the person or people who discovered the note.
```

1. **Provenance and Attribution:** Since the author is unknown and had doubts about the feasibility, it might be challenging to attribute the discovery correctly.
2. **Verification and Validation:** Before publication, the mentioned method should be rigorously tested and validated to confirm its effectiveness and practicality.
3. **Assumptions about Discoverer:** It’s assumed that the discoverer of the note has a scientific background or at least an interest in scientific knowledge and innovations related to water purification.
4. **Historical Context:** The context in which the note was written should be considered, given that the author deemed graphene production unfeasible at the time.

### Publishing Approach:

The information might be published as a part of a larger study validating and refining the method mentioned in the note. It would likely include:

- A mention of the historical context and the anonymous author’s skepticism.
- The results of empirical testing and validation of the method.
- An exploration of the potential implications and applications of this method in addressing water purification needs.
- A discussion on the advancements in graphene production that have made the method feasible.
- An acknowledgment of the unknown author's initial conceptualization and contributions to the refined methodology.
