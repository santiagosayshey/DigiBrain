## Risk
- How much does someone want to attack you?
- It's a matter of balance
	- Addressing risk is costly, you need to balance risk with effectiveness

##### Examples

1. 
```
You're running some home accounting software to calculate your taxes for your lawn mowing business. What level of risk is there to your system and where does it come from?
```

- A moderate level of risk? This software might contain very sensitive information regarding bank accounts, and the information of clients. This risk comes from physical AND digital threats. Since there was no indication of redundancy, either a physical threat like a fire or a digital one like a network attack might lead to some of this data leaking. 

2. 
```
Think about the data associated with the students of the University. What forms does it take and what level of security investment is required?
```

- Large databases with high levels of redundancy and consistency that contain sensitive information about faculty / students. A very high level of security investment should go into protecting this data - encryption, authentication, authorisation, firewalls, antivirus, backups
