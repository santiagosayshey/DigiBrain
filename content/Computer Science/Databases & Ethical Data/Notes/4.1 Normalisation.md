## What is Normalisation?
- Database normalisation aims to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
	- Data redundancy is where we have additional data that duplicates all or some of existing data
	- Data integrity is concerned with maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data for it's lifespan
- We organise the attributes and relationships of the database to achieve this

### How do we achieve this?
- We use various *normal forms* to:
	- Remove undesirable side effects when we insert, update or delete records
	- To find a form for the collection of relations that will not have to be restructured in the future as the application changes
	- To make relational forms more useful
	- To stop the relational form from being dependant on particular query structures


### Undesirable Side Effects
- Normalising prevents unexpected and undesirable things from happening when we add new records, edit records or delete records

#### Update Anomaly

- We can see that we have two "Jane Smiths" with two different possible post codes

#### Insertion Anomaly

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230807143420.png]]

- Because Gene's records are incomplete, we can't add anything to the database (unless we allow NULL values)


#### Deletion Anomaly

- If we were to delete the CS 3001 course, we fall into an insertion anomaly because Jane's records will be incomplete

## Normal Forms

### Unormalised Form (UNF)
- The least normalised form
	- Has a primary key
	- No duplicate tuples
- To achieve this, we usually just add San *id* column to make the primary key unique

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- Each normal form builds on the last, so start from UNF and add this rule
	- The attributes are atomic
		- Each column must have a single value
		- Sets of values and nested records are not available

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Keys are used to identify unique tuples
	- If NULL isn't used, then all of the attributes of a relation will form a **superkey**.
	- If there are smaller collections of attributes that form unique tuples, then this smaller collection of attributes is also a **superkey**
	- If there are no smaller collections of attributes form the ones we're looking at, then this is a minimal superkey, or a **candidate** key
	- Candidate keys are also called keys, primary keys, secondary keys or alternate keys
	- The attributes in a key are **prime** attributes
		- Any note int he key are **non-prime**
- A relation is in second normal form if:
	- It is already in first normal form
	- None of it's non-prime attributes are dependant upon anything less than a whole candidate key

- If we say the primary key consists of Producer + Grape Variety, then we can see that this table violates 2NF since country of origin (a non prime attribute) can be deduced entirely from less than the entire primary key (only the producer)

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230807145033.png]]

- We can fix this by separating into two tables for grapes and origins, where producer in the Origin relation is a foreign key

#### Functional Dependency
- Is a constraint between two attributes
- It's a property of the meanings of attributes
- When an attribute Y is functionally dependant on another X, we say X -> Y
	- Then if we have two tuples t1 and t2,
	- If t1(X) = t2(X), then
		- t1(Y) = t2(y)

##### Examples
- Postcodes and State attributes are usually dependent
- Your student number and your name
	- What about the other way?
- We must find and remove certain functional dependencies to achieve 2NF


### Third Normal Form
- A relation is in third normal form if:
	- The relation is already in second normal form
	- Every **non-prime attribute** is non-transitively dependent on every key in the relation
- A transitive relationship can be explained as:
	- If an element A is related to an element B, and B is related to C, then A and C are related if the relationship is transitive
	- The less than "<" operator is transitive
		- If A < B and B < C, then A < C


#### Transitivity in Databases
- Relational database theory has an additional condition. If X, Y and Z are three different sets of attributes from a relation R, then we need to check these three conditions:

1. X -> Y (The values of Y are determined by the values of X)
2. It is NOT true that Y -> X (the reverse is NOT true)
3. Y -> Z (the values of Z are determined by the values of Y)

- If all three hold, then X -> Z is a functional dependency that is a transitive dependency  

- The problem is when a non prime attribute can depend upon other non prime attributes rather than the prime attributes or the primary key
- The simplest way to think of this is:
	- Any dependencies for non prime attributes are direct
	- Non key attributes are only dependent upon the keys
