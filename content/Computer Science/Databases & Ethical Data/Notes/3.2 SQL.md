- Structured Query Language

## What is SQL?
1. A standard for defining and managing relational databases
2. Goes well beyond specifying the database schema
3. Uses tables for relations, rows for tuples, columns for attributes
4. Exists as standard and heavily customised versions

## Using SQL

- We can create tables and specify their columns and constraints:

```SQL
-- Create Students Table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    EnrolmentDate DATE,
    Prefix VARCHAR(5),
    Degree VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (Degree) REFERENCES Degree(DEGREE)
);

-- Create Degree Table
CREATE TABLE Degree (
    DEGREE VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Duration VARCHAR(10),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

```

- We can collect data from these tables using `select` statements

```sql
SELECT <attribute> FROM <table> WHERE <conditions>
```

```SQL
-- Retrieve all records from the Students table
SELECT * FROM Students;

-- Retrieve specific columns for all students
SELECT ID, Name, EnrolmentDate FROM Students;

-- Retrieve students with a specific prefix ('Mr')
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Prefix = 'Mr';

-- Retrieve students born after a certain date ('2000-01-01')
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE DateOfBirth > '2000-01-01';

-- Retrieve students enrolled in a specific degree ('Computer Science')
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Degree = 'Computer Science';

-- Retrieve students enrolled after a specific date ('2023-01-01') and have a prefix of 'Ms'
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE EnrolmentDate > '2023-01-01' AND Prefix = 'Ms';

-- Retrieve all unique degrees from the Degree table
SELECT DISTINCT DEGREE FROM Degree;

-- Retrieve degrees with their respective departments
SELECT DEGREE, Department FROM Degree;

-- Retrieve degrees that have a duration of '4 years'
SELECT * FROM Degree WHERE Duration = '4 years';

-- Retrieve students with a specific prefix ('Mr') and enrolled in a specific degree ('Computer Science')
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Prefix = 'Mr' AND Degree = 'Computer Science';

-- Retrieve all students whose names start with "J"
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Name LIKE 'J%';
```

### Combining Tables
- What if we want to display all of our students with the names of their degrees?
	- We need to combine these tables using a `join`

- A join clause is used to combine the rows from two or more tables

```SQL
SELECT Students.Name, Degree.Degree
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Degree ON Students.Degree = Degree.DEGREE;
```

##### Examples - Types of Joins

**Students Table:**

|ID|Name|Date of Birth|Phone|Enrolment Date|Prefix|Degree|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|John Smith|1999-05-15|123-456-7890|2023-07-01|Mr|Computer Science|
|2|Jane Doe|2000-11-30|987-654-3210|2023-07-05|Ms|Economics|
|3|Alex Johnson|2002-03-20|555-555-5555|2023-06-15|Mr|Biology|
|4|Sarah Lee|2001-09-10|111-222-3333|2023-07-10|Miss|Mathematics|

**Degree Table:**

|Degree|Duration|Department|
|---|---|---|
|Computer Science|4 years|Computer Science|
|Economics|3 years|Social Sciences|
|Biology|3 years|Life Sciences|
|Mathematics|4 years|Mathematics|


#### Inner Join

```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT Students.Name, Degree.Degree
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Degree ON Students.Degree = Degree.DEGREE;
```

|Name|Degree|
|---|---|
|John Smith|Computer Science|
|Jane Doe|Economics|
|Alex Johnson|Biology|
|Sarah Lee|Mathematics|

Explanation: The INNER JOIN returns only the matching rows from both tables, excluding any rows that don't have a match.

#### Left Join

```sql
-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT Students.Name, Degree.Degree
FROM Students
LEFT JOIN Degree ON Students.Degree = Degree.DEGREE;
```

|Name|Degree|
|---|---|
|John Smith|Computer Science|
|Jane Doe|Economics|
|Alex Johnson|Biology|
|Sarah Lee|Mathematics|

Explanation: The LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (Students) and the matching rows from the right table (Degree). If there is no match, it returns NULL for the right table's columns.

#### Right Join

```sql
-- RIGHT JOIN
SELECT Students.Name, Degree.Degree
FROM Students
RIGHT JOIN Degree ON Students.Degree = Degree.DEGREE;
```

|Name|Degree|
|---|---|
|John Smith|Computer Science|
|Jane Doe|Economics|
|Alex Johnson|Biology|
|Sarah Lee|Mathematics|
|NULL|Social Sciences|

Explanation: The RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table (Degree) and the matching rows from the left table (Students). If there is no match, it returns NULL for the left table's columns.

#### Full Outer Join

```sql
-- FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT Students.Name, Degree.Degree
FROM Students
FULL OUTER JOIN Degree ON Students.Degree = Degree.DEGREE;
```


|Name|Degree|
|---|---|
|John Smith|Computer Science|
|Jane Doe|Economics|
|Alex Johnson|Biology|
|Sarah Lee|Mathematics|
|NULL|Social Sciences|

Explanation: The FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows when there is a match in either the left table (Students) or the right table (Degree). If there is no match, it returns NULL for the non-matching table's columns.
