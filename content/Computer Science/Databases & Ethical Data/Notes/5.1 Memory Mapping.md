## Memory
- A computer's storage media include:
	- Primary storage that can be directly acted upon by the CPU (Main memory and caches)
- Secondary storage that holds data which cannot be accessed by the CPU until it is transferred into primary storage
	- Discs, CDs and Tapes

### Primary Storage
- The different parts of primary storage have different performance characteristics
	- Main memory is the largest component of primary storage but is the relatively slowest to access
	- The caches provide increased access speed but at the cost of their size
		- There are often three, sometimes even four levels of cache
		- L1 caches can be very small and dedicated to specific tasks
		- L2 caches start go get larger and are more generic
		- L3 caches are larger

#### How Caching Works
- When the CPU wants to access data, it 
1. Checks the L1 cache first
	- If it finds what it's look for, that's a hit and execution proceeds, otherwise it's a miss
2. Then checks the L2 cache looking for a hit
3. Then L3
4. And if nothing hits, then it will access main memory over the databus

## Database Memory
- Databases are large!
	- The full database is often stored in secondary storage and only pieces of it are brought into main memory for operations
	- We have to design databases so that the storage, searching and indexing methods we use will be efficient based on how we know computers work
	- We need a way to manage volatility for integrity

### Storage and Retrieval
- Records should be stored in a way that makes them easy and efficient to locate, with the primary file organisations telling us how those records are placed on disk and how we can access them


### Primary File Organisations
- Heap file
- Sorted (or sequential) file
- Hashed file
- B+ trees

### Performance and Security
- Memory is mapped in real systems, many virtual overlays placed over physical memory
- This increases performance but means that you don't know exactly where things are being stored
- Higher performance often requires more redundancy and more re used of unencrypted data


##### Examples

```
To allow for the movement of data in and out of the caches, memory is divided up into pages, contiguous blocks of memory of a fixed size. A page table is used to map the virtual address to the physical address and lets us work out which pages we need from memory based on what the proggrammer has asked for, whether pages have been changed, and this allows us to improve efficiency by quickly resolving cache misses. 

What is the possible advantage if an individual database record can fit within one page?
```

- More efficient / fast since we only need to load a single page. The more pages we need to load, the slower the process will be

```
Secondary organisations allow efficient access to records based on alternate fields than those used for the primary file organisation. We'll look at these when we address indexed in an upcoming concept recording. An index allows you to quickly look up records without searching the whole DB. 

What is an advantage of optimising your index so that the top level of the index fits within one page?
```

- We can access the page using a single I/O operation
