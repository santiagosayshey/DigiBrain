##### Examples

```
Your web based business is located in America, but you do extensive business with firms in London. Are they liable to the provisions of the GDPR?
```

Yes. The GDPR has extraterritorial scope. This means that the GDPR doesn't just apply to companies based in the EU, but it also applies to any company worldwide if they **Offer goods or services (even for free) to EU residents**

```
I have given my email address to domain.com.au to contact me of a certain house goes on the market. A month later, domain.com.au contact me to see if I'm interested in another house. Is this an appropriate use of my data and if not, what would domain.com.au need to do in order to ensure that this is compliant
```

- **Inappropriate Use of Data**: If you've specifically given your email address to domain.com.au for the sole purpose of being informed about a particular house, then contacting you about another house (without your explicit consent for that kind of notification) can be considered inappropriate or beyond the scope of the original intent of data collection.
    
- **Compliance Measures**:
    
    - **Clear Consent**: domain.com.au would need to ensure they have clear, explicit consent from you for broader marketing or promotional activities. This means when you provide your email, they should clearly specify (or ask you) if you'd like to receive other property listings, promotions, or any other marketing content.
    - **Opt-out Mechanism**: Every promotional email should have a clear mechanism for you to opt out or unsubscribe from future communications.
    - **Data Minimization**: They should only collect data that is necessary for the specified purpose and not use it beyond that purpose unless they have explicit consent.
    - **Transparency**: It should be clearly communicated to you how your data will be used. This is often done through a privacy policy or a specific notification at the point of data collection.
