## Modelling Dependants
- Employees might have children
	- Why do we need to keep track of them?
	- How do we keep track of them?
	- What does this look like in ER?

## ER Diagram for Dependants
- Dependants are a weak entity, they don't have (or need) their own key attribute (Entities with a key attribute are strong entities)
- A weak entity is identified by being associated with entities from another entity type, using one of that entity type's attributes
- This other entity type is the identifying or owner entity type
- The relationships type that relates a weak entity to its owner is an identifying relationship
- Weak entities always have a total participation constraint with respect to the identifying relationship because it cannot be identified without a relationship to the owner

- ER Modelling is iterative
	- Concepts may start as attributes and become relationships
	- Attributes in several entity types may be elevated or promoted to a new entity
	- Inversely, entities with only one attribute may become attributes of another entity

##### Examples

```
You are working on an ER diagram to show the ternary (degree three) relationship SUPPLY that connects the entity types SUPPLIER, PART and PROJECTS. PROJECTS require certain PARTs which are supplied by SUPPLIERs. 

Draw the ER diagram that models this.
```

```
You are asked to add INVOICE entities to your model, where the PURCHASE_ORDER relationship is a ternary relationship between PROJECT, SUPPLIER and INVOICE. Every invoice must be associated with the supplier but a given project may have 0, 1,  or many invoices 

Draw the ER diagram that models this.
```
