## Duty based ethics
- Focused on always doing the right thing (following your duty) rather than worrying about the outcomes
## Consequence based ethics
- Focused on what the outcomes are of our actions, what we do is not as important as what happens

## How to be good
- What will lead to the best result, the *maximum good*
- Assume that being consistent is important 

## Beneficial Calculus
- If we're seeking to have the best result (outcome), for the greatest number, how do we calculate this?
- Impact of bias:
	- Your ability to apply your ethics is affected by your perception of the world, the lenses you use
	- Unconscious bias changes the way you perceive the world
	- Unconscious bias can upset the beneficial calculus

##### Examples

```
A runaway trolley is speeding towards a junction. Two people are tied to the track that the trolley is speeding towards. You can pull a lever and switch the trolley to another track, but you will kill a single person who is tied to the other track. 

How would you decide to pull the lever, given you cannot free the people or stop the trolley in other way.
```

- There is no 'good' in this scenario, someone will die. The maximum good that we can achieve is only killing 1 person, as opposed to two. 
- Perhaps there exists conscious biases that shape the way we think about these people based on the way they look, how they're dressed, how they scream for help
	- Maybe one person decides to save the 1 person as opposed to the two because they're a different skin colour than them
	- Or they save the 1 because the other two are wearing raggedy clothing
- Perhaps we alleviate that action by not touching the lever at all. Is it murder if someone was going to die regardless?

```
A well known study of parole board judges found the judges were less likely to grant parole when they were tired or hungry. What is this an example of? 

How could you ensure that this issued not unfairly affect one group of people disproportionately?
```

- Unconscious bias?
- We set a baseline for hunger and sleep and ensure that each judge abides by these to be considered apt to conduct trials
