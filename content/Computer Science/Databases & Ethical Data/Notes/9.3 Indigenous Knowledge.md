## Approaches to Knowledge
- Tangible knowledge may be interlinked
- Knowledge may be directly received rather than discovered
- Many approaches favour custodianship over ownership
- Access to knowledge may be limited by many factors
- The access controls are as much apart of cultural practice as the knowledge 

## Existing Parallel Knowledge Systems
- Secret, sacred and gendered
	- Freemasons
- Land stories
	- Southern navigation

## Intellectual Property
- Existing legal structures
- Sui Generis - a unique set of laws
- Incompatible Systems

## Database Design (Default)
- Access controls extend to users
- Admins have open access to all content
- Safeguards in case of lost account / crypto keys
- No principle of veto
- No indigenous cultural aspect

## Database Design (New)
- Access controls extend to all participants
- Admins cannot access all content
- Limited recovery mechanisms
- Consensus on storage and sharing
- Technical governed by the cultural 

### Specific Impact
- Keys need to avoid sharing information
- Databases need to be highly normalised to contain information
- Extensive use of cryptography
- Use of privacy preserving operations
- Some storage may never meet cultural requirements 

##### Examples

1. 
```
We know that we can form minimal superkeys from existing attributes in many tables. Why would we prefer to use a neutral automatically generated primary key that does not use any attributes for the storage of culturally sensitive information?
```

### 1. **Non-Disclosure of Sensitive Information:**

Automatically generated keys, like a sequence of numbers, do not reveal any information about the data they are associated with. In contrast, a key made from actual attributes may disclose sensitive information. For instance, if a primary key is constructed using parts of a person's name or date of birth, it could expose private details about individuals, potentially leading to privacy violations and discriminatory practices.

### 2. **Avoidance of Bias and Stigmatization:**

Using actual attributes to form keys could unintentionally introduce bias or perpetuate stereotypes and stigmatization, especially when handling culturally sensitive information. Neutral keys avoid these issues by not relying on any specific attribute and treating all records uniformly.

2.
```
While indigenous knowledge traditions can appear more restrictive in terms of knowledge use, we know that non-indigenous systems can be far less sharing with sensitive or valuable data. If some examples of the kind of data you could find today in a database that could be considered sensitive or valuable, should that information be available to anyone with admit privileges? Explain your answer.
```

- No it should not be. Information is valuable and can be used in nefarious ways that affect the people whose information is being shared without their consent. What gives the right to an admin to this information?
