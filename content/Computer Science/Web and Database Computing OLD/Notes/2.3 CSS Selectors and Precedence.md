# CSS Tag Selectors
- CSS selectors allow application of styles based on variety of different properties of elements
- The simplest of these is by element type / tag name

```css
h2 {
	/* Applies to all h2 tags*/
}
```

```css
a {
	/* Applies to all a tags*/
}
```

# CSS Class and ID Selectors
- The next of these is by element id or class name

```css
#someid {
	/* Applies to the element with id 'someid' */
}
```

```css
.someclass {
	/* Applies to ALL elements with class 'someclass'*/
}
```


# CSS Attribute Selectors
- We can also select by the attributes of tags

```css
[disabled] {
	/* Applies to all elements with a disabled attibute */
}
```

```css
[title="Click here for more"] {
	/* Applies to all elements with tool tool-tip that says "Click here for more" */
}
```

# CSS Combined Selectors
- CSS Selectors can be combined for better specification

- Descendant (Does not have to immediately follow the div tag)

```css
div a {
	/* Applies to a tags that are descendants of divs */
}
```

- Combing Class and Tag Name

```css
div.someclass {
	/* Applies to divs with class 'someclass' */
}
```

- Select multiple tags

```css
div, a {
	/* Applies to all divs AND a tags */
}
```

- Direct Descendants (Must immediately follow the div tag)
```css
div > a { 
	/* Applies to a tags that are immediate children of divs */ 
}
```

- Combining attribute and tag name

```css
input[type="text"] { 
	/* Applies to all text inputs */ 
}
```

- Select all

```css
* { 
	/* Applies to all elements */ 
}
```

- These are just the basic selectors, there are MANY more

# CSS Style Precedence

- The more generic a selector is, the lower it's precedence is over other, more specific selectors

```css
h1.main span { ... }
```
 is more specific than: 
```css
span { ... }
```

- Where selectors have the same specificity, the newest selector / last selector to load is chosen

```css
div { color: black;}
div { color: blue;}
```

The second rule (blue) will be chosen in this case

- CSS applied inline ( Using a style attribute on a specific element) has the highest specificity
	- I.e. Style written in the HTML code has the highest precedence


# Inspecting and Debugging CSS

- We can use our browsers to inspect a web page, select different elements and determine if the correct style is being applied
