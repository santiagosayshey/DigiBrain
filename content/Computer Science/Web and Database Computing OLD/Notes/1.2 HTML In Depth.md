# Tables

- Tables are used to display `Tabular data`
	- Defined using a `<table>` tag
	- Tables are made up of rows, defined using `<tr>` tags
	- Rows are made up of individual cells
	- Individual cells can be defined as: 
		- Headings `<th>`
		- Data `<td>`

```HTML
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>1st Column</th>
    <th>2nd Column</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data</td>
    <td>More data</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Merging Cells
- Cells can be defined to span more than one row or column
	- Use `colspan` attribute to have a cell take up more space horizontally
	- Use `rowspan` attribute to have a cell take up more space vertically

```HTML
<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2>Header</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan=2>Data</td>
    <td>More data</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even more data</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

- Tables are used ONLY for tabular data, not for layout

# Forms
- Allow for input and submission of user data
	- Defined using a `form` tag 
		- Inputs defined using `input`, `select`, `textarea` and `button` tags

```HTML
<form action="/page.php">
  Name:<br />
  <input type="text" name="firstname" value="Bob" />
  <br />
  Occupation:<br />
  <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Anthropologist" />
  <br /><br />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form> 
```

## Inputs
- For inputs have:
	- `name` and `value`, which are used to access the input's data when processing the form
	- `type`, which defines the way the input is displayed. This includes:
		- `text` displays a single line text box
		- `button` displays a regular button
		- `password` displays a single line text box whose characters are hidden
		- `submit` displays a button that submits the form upon clicking
		- `file` displays a file upload field
		- `checkbox` displays a checkbox

## Alternate Form Input Elements
- `select` tag
	- Drop down list
	- Contains `option` tags for each entry in the dropdown
	- Similar to lists
- `textarea` tag
	- Multi-line input
	- Body of the input is it's value
```HTML
<select name='dropdown'>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
</select>


<textarea name="message" rows="10" cols="30">
  Multi line input here
</textarea>
```

# Generic Elements
- Divs
	- Are used as generic containers for other elements
	- Use specific elements when you can, otherwise use a generic element
	- Use the `<div>` tag

```HTML
<div>
	<p> Some text here </p>
	<img src="image.jpg" />
</div>
```

- Spans
	- Used as generic containers for text
	- Is an inline element, meaning it can be within text

```HTML
<p> Some <span> text </span> here </p>
```

# Key Attributes
- `id`
	- A unique identifier that can be assigned to an individual element in a document
		- Must be unique within that document
		- An element can only have 1 id
		- Can be used to link to a subsection of a page
		- Can be used in CSS or when selecting elements in code

```HTML
<h1 id="first_heading"> It's the first heading </p
```

- We can use an anchor element and assign `#id` to the `href` attribute to link to the element that has that id

```HTML
<a href="#id"> Go to Hello </a>

<h2 id='id'> Hello </h2>
```

```
Clicking the anchor element "Go to Hello" will move the page to the header "Hello"
```

- `class`
	- A common identifier that can be assigned to group elements in a document
		- Can be used across different elements of different types
		- An element can have mulitple classes
		- Can be used in CSS or when selecting elements in code
	- Should always use class over id

```HTML
<p class='main bob'> It's Bob's main paragraph </p> // this has two classes, main and bob
<p class='bob'> A normal one of Bob's paragraphs </p> // this has class bob
```

- `style`
	- Is used to change the appearance of an individual element in a document
		- Same syntax as CSS
	- Should only use style in CSS, not HTML

```HTML
<div style="background-color: grey;">
	This div has a grey background!
</div>
```


# Special Characters
- Some characters are reserved such as "<"
- We can represent these characters using special notation like this:
	- `&lt; or &#60;`
	- Can use Entity number or Entity name


# Validation and the Standard
- The purpose of specification is to define how browsers should behave when rendering a web page
- If two browsers are compliant, they will, in theory, render the same page to appear the same
- But what happens if your website doesn't meet the standard?
	-  UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR
		- Leading to your website looking different on different platforms and browsers

- We can ensure our websites are compliant using the W3C validator
	- https://validator.w3.org/

- Reasons to validate:
	1. Can help you to debug your code
	2. Can help future-proof your work
	3. Eases maintenence
