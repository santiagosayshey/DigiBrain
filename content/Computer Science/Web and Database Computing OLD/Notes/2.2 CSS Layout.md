# Box Model

## Content
- The area where content actually appears
![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230227092743.png]]

- By default, width & height are measured to the content area only
- Specify size using width and height properties

```CSS
div {
	width: 10cm;
	height: 4cm;
}
```

## Padding
- The area between the border of an object and the content:

`Padding vs No Padding:`

- Takes up space in addition to the width of the element

### Specifying Padding

- Use the `padding` property

```css
div {
padding: 1em;
}
```

- Can also specify individual paddings for each side of the element

```css
div {
	padding-top: 1em;
	padding-right: 2em;
	padding-bottom: 3em;
	padding-left: 4em;
}
```

- Or shortened (clockwise - top, right, bottom, left)

```css
div {
	padding: 1em 2em 3em 4em
}
```

## Borders
- A line around the outside of an object:
![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230227093737.png]]

- Also takes up space in addition to the width of the element
- Have several properties
	- Width (standard measurement units)
	- Style (solid, dashed, double)
	- Color (name, rgb(a), hex, hsl(a))

### Specifying Borders
- Specify size using border property and each of the sub properties

```css
div {
	border: 1px solid red;
}
```

- Specify individual borders for each side of the element

```css
div { 
	border-top: 1px solid red; 
	border-right: 2px dashed #00ffff; 
	border-bottom: 3px double rgba(255,128,128,50%); 
	border-left: none; 
}
```

- Rounded corners with border-radius property

```css
div { 
	border-radius: 5px; 
}
```

## Margins
- Space between the element and neighbouring elements
![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230227094408.png]]
- Not included in the width of the element

### Specifying Margins

- Same as for padding:

```css
div { 
	margin: 1em; 
}
```

- Can specify for each side of the element

```css
div { 
	margin-top: 1em; 
	margin-right: 2em; 
	margin-bottom: 3em; 
	margin-left: 4em; 
}
```

- Or shortened (clockwise, top, right, bottom, left)

```css
div { 
	margin: 1em 2em 3em 4em; 
}
```

## Outlines
- A line drawn outside of the border to make an element stand out
![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230227094759.png]]

- Specify same as border
- Does not affect the size of an element

# Box Sizing
- By default, width and height only specift content area, but often we want size to include padding and borders
- We can get around this using the `box-sizing` property
	- The `content-box` value is the default
		- Width and height are the content area only
	- The `border-box` value changes width and height to include padding and borders

# Positioning
- Elements can be moved on the page using the top, left, bottom and right properties
- The `position` property specifies the method by which an element is positioned
	- `static` (default) the elment is positioned normally within the page's structure
	- `relative` the element's position is modified relative to it's normal position
	- `absolute` the element's position is modified relative to it's parent element or within the entire page
	- `fixed` the element's position is set relative to the viewport (window)

# Float
- Elements can be seperated from the main flow of content in a container using the `float` property
	- The `float` property can push elements to the `left` or `right` of their container, causing inline content to wrap around the floating content
	- The `clear` property can force non-floating content to appear beneath the floating content instead of wrapping
		- Can be set to `left`, `right` or `both`

# Display
- The `display` property allows us to specify how an object will appear and behave on the page
	- The default value depends on the element
	- `none` The element is hidden and takes up no space on the page
	- `inline` The element takes up only as much space as needed and does not start on a new line
		- Width and Height cannot be set
	- `block` The element starts on a new line and fills the width of the avaiable space
	- `inline-block` The element does not start on a newline, but can have a set width and height 

`Examples:`

```HTML
<div style='display: block;' block </div>
<div style='display: inline;' inline </div>
<div style='display: inline-block;' inline-block </div>
```

# Flexbox & Grid
- Newder developments in display / positioning have been the introduction of CSS Grid & Flexbox
	- This allows us to layout our webpages in a more responsive way, where parts can be alligned to a grid and stretch in different ways when the page is resized
	- It consists of a parent element / flex container that holds the items that need positioning, and child elements / flex items that are positioned within

- Flex Container
	- Use `display: flex`
	- You can define whether it's organised by row / column, item alignment, wrapping, stretching and more
- Flex Items
	- You can define ordering, relative size, ability to stretch and more
