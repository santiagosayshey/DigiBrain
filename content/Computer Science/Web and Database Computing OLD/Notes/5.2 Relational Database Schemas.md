## Database Schema
- The schema defines the relational model for a database, how data is divided into tables in Database design has an impact on storage requirements and efficiency of accessing data
- Good schema design delivers:
	- Minimal redundancy of information
		- The same information should not appear in multiple places
	- Easy to understand the relationship of the data
		- Information is properly organised or split into logical pieces, making it easy to access
	- Database performs fast and efficiently
		- Data is organised to find information, with fewer steps, and without retrieving more than needed
- Important because most web applications are transaction intensiveL
	- Users are often creating, reading, updating and deleting data

## Designing a Schema

1. Specify / Understand requirements
2. Model the data ( optional - we will skip this )
3. Develop a relation schema
4. Implement relation schema

### Step 1: Specifying / Understanding Requirements

- Defining data requirements needs an understanding of how customers or users will use the data
- Things to consider:
	- What data is available
	- How the data is related

#### Store Example
- The store wants to keep a record of all their customers and the items they've purchased during each shopping trip
- What data do we need?
	- Customer Details
		- Customer Name
		- Customer Phone Number
		- Customer Address
		- Customer Loyalty Card Number
	- Items Purchased
		- Name
		- Description
		- Barcode / Inventory Number
		- Price
	- Total Cost of Items
	- Shopping Trip Date / Time
	- Store Shopped at
		- Store address
- How is the data related?
	- Customers make shopping trips
	- Items are purchased on shopping trips

- Now that we know what information we need to store, we can build it into a database

### Step 2: Model Data using High Level (ER) Model
- In large / complex systems, before we create our schema, we develop a high levle model of the data in the system and how it is related
- An Entity-Relationship (ER) Model illustrates the relationship of the data and can be easily derived into a database schema, reducing the likelihood of errors
- **Not using this in this course!**

### Step 3: Develop a Relation Schema
- A database schema is a blueprint for the structure of our database
- Consists of tables organised into columns, representing groups of attributes that each entity/ row in the table shares
	- Each row must be **unique**
		- The columns that make a row unique are called the **primary key**
		- Every table must have a primary key
	- Tables can be related to each other
		- This relationship is established by a reference to the other table's primary key
		- This is called a **foreign key**
- This can be illustrated through a **Schema Diagram**

#### Group Related Data, Remove Unecessary Data

- We can remove items such as total cost and store shopped at as they are unnessecary for this database

#### Add Primary Keys

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319121343.png]]

- Where `*` is a primary key
- A combination of a column can also be used as a primary key
- If in doubt using an existing column as a primary key, create a new one

#### Build Relationships
- How is the data related?
	- Customs make shopping trips
	- Items are purchased on shopping trips
- We need to create relationships between:
	- Customers and shopping trips
	- Items and shopping trips
- **Establish a reference to the other table's Primary Key**

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319121619.png]]

#### Relationship Cardinality
-  We want to establish a reference to the other table's Primary Key
- But how do we know which table to add the reference to?
- Relationship cardinality describes for each row of a table, how many rows of the related table it can be associated with.
	- Can a customer make multiple shopping trips?
	- Can a shopping trip have many customers?
- Cardinality Types
	- `1-1` (one to one)
		- Each customer can make a single shopping trip
		- Each shopping trip can only be made by a single customer
		- Reference can be either the customer or shopping trip table
	- `1-N` (one to many)
		- Each customer can make many shopping trips
		- Each shopping trip can only be made by a single customer
		- Make the many table (shopping trip) the referance
	- `N-N` (many to many)
		- Each customer can make many shopping trips
		- Each shopping trip can have many customers
		- **This does not work!** Needs to be changed to `1-N`

#### Improving Our Schema
- Having a robust schema is important
	- A robust schema makes finding and updating data easy
	- A robust schema makes database transactions fast, even for very complex transactions
	- A robust schema prevents data from becoming inconsistent or corrupt
- **How do we ensure a robust schema?**

#### Normalisation and Normal Forms
- Database normalisation is the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance witha  series of normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity
- This helps to:
	- Reduce redundancy
		- Ensure the same data doesn't appear in multiple places in the database
	- Enforces dependencies and integrity
		- Ensure that updating data in the database doesn't break anything
- Can be done in steps, known as normal forms
	- There are 6 normal forms, we want to make sure our schema is **at least 3rd normal form**

##### 1st Normal Form
- The domain of an attribute / column must include only atomic (simple, indivisible) values and the value of any attribute in a row / tuple must be a single value from the domain of that attribute
- In other words:
	- Each column must only contain 1 value
	- That value should not be able to be sub divided into smaller components

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319123652.png]]

##### 2nd Normal Form
- The schema is in the 1st normal form and does not have any attribute / column that is only dependany on part of the key
- In other words:
	- When a composite key is used ( a primary key consisting of multiple attributes ), the other attributes should relate to all parts of the key

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319123929.png]]

- Assuming each combination of `trip` and `item` was unique, we could represent this as a composite key
- Consider what would happen if we then added a purchase date field

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319124417.png]]

- This would violate 2nd normal form because the purchase date is associated with the shopping trip but not both the trip and item
- In this case, we would either need to create a new table just for trip and purchase date, or remove the redundant information if it already exist (it does in the shopping trip table)


##### 3rd Normal Form
- The schema is in 2nd normal form and does not have any attribute / column that dependant on another non-key attribute
- In other words:
	- Columns should not reference other columns that aren't keys

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319131320.png]]

- This would violate 3rd normal form because the purchase date is associated with the shopping trip, and the shopping trip is not part of the key


##### 4th Normal Form
- The schema is in 3rd normal form and does not combine many to many relationships in a single table
- In other words:
	- Do not combine many to many relationships into a single table

![[docs/Images/Pasted image 20230319131601.png]]

- Consider if the same shopping trip could be made by multiple users; we would require an extra table for users on each trip
- But we already have a table for trip and items (purchases)
- What if we tried to combine the new table with purchases?
	- This would violate 4th normal form because we are essentially using the table to store 2 different record types
