## Express Server Files

- Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls
	- A request is passed to express
	- Express passes the request from one function to the next, until the request reaches an endpoint
		- Requests can be filtered by path and method    

### Server
- `bin` contains program files used to run our server
	- `www` Node.js script that sets up and starts the basic server
- `node_modules` contains modules installed via npm
- `routes` contains Node.js code files for serving dynamic content
	- `index.js` & `users.js` Node.js scripts allows modularising of code
- `app.js` is the main Node.js application file
- `package-lock.json` locks the versions of the modules used
- `package.json` contains a metadata about our app

### Client
- `public` contains files we can server statically inluding any client-side code

## bin/www
- Node.js script that sets up and starts the basic server
	- Utilises the Node.js HTTP library to start a basic server
	- Binds the server to a port on the host system and starts listening for requests
	- Provides the `req` and `res` objects for processing
	- Passes those objects to Express

## app.js
- Our app.js file is the main file for our web application
	- Contains libraries and middleware that will be used across the whole application

## routes/index.js & users.js
- Files in the routes folder allow us to split our routes into smaller modules to make them easier to manage

## Routes and Middleware
- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res) and the next middleware function in the applications request-response cycle
- The next middleware function is commonly denotes by a varaible named next
- Middleware functions can perform the following tasks
	- Execute any code
	- Make changes to the request and the response objects
	- End the request-response cycle
	- Call the next middleware function in the stack
- If the current middleware function does not end the cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging

### Why Middleware?
- Allows efficient rule-based code reuse
- Seperate our code into distinct functions
- Easily include external libraries

### Basic Middleware

```js
// In app.js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
 // Do stuff
 next();
});

// In routes/*.js
router.use(function(req, res, next) {
 // Do stuff
 next();
});
```

- the `.use` method applies this middleware to all requests
- `.next` is a callback used to call the next piece of middleware in the chain
	- Calling next allows the request to continue being processed
	- Not calling `next` will cause tje request to stop being processed, and the request may hang / timeout if `res.end / res.send` not used (no response send)


### Basic Middleware... with a Path

- We can apply paths to middleware the same way we do to GET / POST requests

```js
// In app.js
app.use('/some/path', function(req, res, next) {
 // Do stuff
 next();
});

// In routes/*.js
router.use('/some/path', function(req, res, next) {
 // Do stuff
 next();
});
```

### Routes are Middleware?!
- In fact, you specift the method to middleware the same way do to GET / POST requests. Our routes are just middleware without the next();

```js
// In app.js
app.get('/some/path', function(req, res, next) {
 // Do stuff
 next();
});

// In routes/*.js
router.post('/some/path', function(req, res, next) {
 // Do stuff
 next();
});
```
