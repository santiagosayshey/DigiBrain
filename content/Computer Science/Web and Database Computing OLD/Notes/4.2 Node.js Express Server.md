# Building A Node.js Express Server

## Node.js
- Node is becoming popular for web applications
	- Javascript
		- One language for client AND server
		- Event driven
		- Familar programming style
	- Asynchronous
		- Peformance (does not have to wait for slow operations to complete)
		- Using `call back` functions (called when the operation completes, this allows the server to deal with other tasks until the call back is triggered)

## Express
- Express is a web applications framework for Node.js
	- Its purpose is to make it easy to write web applications in Node.js
- Setting up a basic Express server is easy!
	- The express generator will setup your Node.js directory structure for you
		- Run the command `express`
	- We can then modify the files that the generator created for us

## Setting up an Express server

- `express` creates:
	- `bin` contains program files used to run our server
	- `public` contains files we can serve statically
	- `routes` contains Node.js files for serving dynamic content
	- `app.js` is the main Node.js application file
	- `package.json` contains the metadata about our app
- We can then run `npm install` to install dependencies for our web server. This creates:
	- `node_modules` contains library files to run our server
	- `package-lock.json` locks the versions of libraries used

- We can then run `npm start` to start our webserver

### Serving Static Files
- Files placed in the public folder would be avaiable at the corresponding path
	- A file created at `public/test.html` would be avaiable at `localhost:8080/test.html`
	- A file created at `public/css/cssTest.html` would be avaiable at `localhost:8080/css/cssTest.html`
