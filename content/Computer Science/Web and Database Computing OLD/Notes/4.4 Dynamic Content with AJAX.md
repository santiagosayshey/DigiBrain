- Sending an **entire** webapge has a huge drawback, in that is wastes server resources
- Often, there are select things we we want to change inside a webpage and not the entire webpage itself
- We can achieve this with ***Ajax***

# AJAX
- Asynchronous Javascript And XML allows us to make HTTP Requests and process the responses in the background
	- Saves Time
		- Load Page content as we need it
	- Reduce Network Load
		- Send only the information we need
		- Allows caching of other page resources
	- Reduce Server Load
		- Generate HTML on client
		- Less time sepdn processing and sending response
	- Better User Experience
		- Whole page doesn't need to reload for user to view new content
		- Content can be loaded in the background - seamless

## What's Happening?
1. An event occurs in a webapge ( the page is loaded, a button is clicked, etc )
2. An AJAX request is created by JavaScript
3. The request is sent to the webserver
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the webpage
6. The response is read by Javascript
7. JavaScript updates the page

## Asynchronous vs Synchronous

- Asynchronous code allows us to prevent the main event loop from blocking while we wait for a response. 
- This allows the user to continue to interact with the webpage, which they would not be able to do if synchronous
- So what if we want the behavior of synchronous code ( a certain action to happen after another ), but the advantages of asynchronous code ( non-blocking )?

- We can use a callback function!

### Callback Functions
- A function passed as an argument to another function to be called after it completes

```js
function a() { 
	console.log("a"); 
} 

function bAsync(callback) { 
	console.log("b"); 
	callback(); 
} 

bAsync(a); // Prints b then a
```

- Determine if you need to use a callback
	- Make sure that the code after asynchronous calls does not rely on the aynchronous call completing
	- If the code does rely on the asynchronous call completing, make it a callback


### Making an AJAX Call

```js
/* 1. Create new AJAX request */
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

/* 4. Handle response (callback function) */
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
 if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
	 console.log(this.responseText);
 }

};

/* 2. Open connection */
xhttp.open("GET", "/request/uri", true);

/* 3. Send request */
xhttp.send();
```

#### The XMLHttpRequest Object

```js
/* 1. Create new AJAX request */
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

/* 2. Open connection */
xhttp.open("GET", "/request/uri", true);
```

- The XMLHttpRequest object is a standard javscript browser object that can be used to send requests to servers
	- Initalise the request with the open method:
		- `open(method, URL, Asynchronous?)`
	- Note that the call can be synchronous, by setting last argument to falsem but then the browser will not do any further action on the page until the server responds, and this method is depracated

```js
/* 3. Send request */
xhttp.send();
```

- Send the request to the server with the send method
	- `send(data)`
- Data is optional
- If you have data to send to the server, you send it here
	- Used for a `POST` request where there is form data or `JSON` to send to the server

```js
/* 4. Handle response (callback function) */
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
 if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
	 console.log(this.responseText);
 }
```

- Sets up a listener (`onReadyStateChange`) to listen for XMLHttpRequest events
- What triggers the onreadystatechange event of an XMLHttpRequest?
	- When the request is opened, `request.readyState == 1`
	- When the response headers are received, `request.readyState == 2`
	- When the body starts to load, `request.readyState == 4`
	- When the response is finished loading, `request.readyState == 4`

<hr>

- The `onReadyStateChange` function will be called everytime the state changes

```js
/* 4. Handle response (callback function) */ 
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { 
	if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { 
		// the response is done downloading 
		// and the status code was 200 OK 
		// this.response will give us the response } 
	else { 
		// Do I want to do something when the headers arrive 
		// or one of the other states, 
		// or the status code is 404 or another error 
	} 
};
```

#### Handling the AJAX Response

- Accessed using

```js
xhttp.responseText
```

- An AJAX response can be anything
	- Plain Text: encoded as UTF-8
	- HTML: ready to insert into our webpage
	- XML: Method of storing data using DOM
	- JSON: Text representation of JavaScript objects
	- Images
	- Anything!

# JSON
- JavaScript Object Noration is a way of represending JavaScript objects as text

```JSON
{ 
	"myarray": [ 
		{ "name":"Max", "age":24 }, 
		{ "name":"Ji", "age":23 } ], 
	"count": 2 }
}
```

- Using JSON Allows us to send objects directly between client and server
