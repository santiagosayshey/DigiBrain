> [!idea] Functions
> A function is a r**elation between a set of inputs (domain) and a set of outputs (codomain)** where each input is related to exactly one output. Functions can be represented using equations, tables, or graphs. For example, the equation $f(x) = 2x + 1$ represents a linear function that maps each input $x$ to the output $2x + 1$.

> [!idea] Polynomials
> A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of variables and coefficients, combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The variables in a polynomial can have non-negative integer exponents. The general form of a polynomial in one variable $x$ is:
> 
> $$a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$
> 
> where $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are constants called coefficients, and $n$ is a non-negative integer. For example, $3x^2 + 2x - 5$ is a polynomial.

> [!idea] Degree of a Polynomial
> The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For a polynomial in one variable, the degree determines the number of possible roots (solutions) of the polynomial equation. A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ distinct roots. For example, the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x - 5$ has a degree of 2, so it can have at most 2 distinct roots.

> [!idea] Coefficient
> In a polynomial, a coefficient is a constant multiplicative factor of a term. In the general form of a polynomial $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, the constants $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are the coefficients. The coefficient of the highest degree term, $a_n$, is called the leading coefficient. For example, in the polynomial $3x^2 + 2x - 5$, the coefficients are 3, 2, and -5, with 3 being the leading coefficient.
