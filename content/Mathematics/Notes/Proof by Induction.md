> **Proof By Induction**: A technique to show a statement is true for all cases by proving it for a base case and then for every successive case based on the previous one. In order to prove a mathematical statement $T(n)$, we use the following template:
> 1. **Base Case:** We need to show that $T(n)$ is true for the smallest possible value of n; you can use 0 or 1 or 2, depending on the question and how you would like to drive your solution.
> 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement $T(n)$ is true for any positive integer say for $n=k$.
> 3. **Inductive Step:** Show that the statement $T(n)$ is true for $n=k+1$ .
