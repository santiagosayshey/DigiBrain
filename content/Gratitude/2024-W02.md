| Day of the Week | Question 1 | Question 2 | Question 3 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Monday | I am grateful for | Something I did for someone else today | Something funny that happened today |
|  | Online mental health communities - r/bpd. Whenever I feel really alone and angry at myself for the way I feel, it really helps to know that there are other people with the same struggle | Helped a couple of friends online setup some cross seeding tools. Info -  Cross seeding just allows you to share the media that you already own with new media sharing communities that you might have joined. | Watched the new Yeah Mad dad jokes video - if you want a laugh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93HEp2yS2oc |
| Tuesday | Something good that I saw someone do | Something interesting that happened today | Today I had fun when |
|  | BTN (an online community dedicated to preserving TV - BroadcastTheNet) forums had been quiet for a really long time. A couple of old dedicated users started up a thread to get the ball rolling again and encourage all the new users to share their TV related stories. I got to share mine about how my last counsellor at headspace was an actor in Mr. Inbetween. | Learned about Bernoulli's Principle to get all the hot air out of the room. It was boiling hot and couldn't stand the heat anymore. Was cool to do it in an interesting way. | Watching the Thunder v Wizards game. I'm starting to watch more NBA games again, haven't been this into it since 2019. My team is good again, so it makes it easier. |
| Wednesday | Today I smiled when | My favourite part of today | Something new I did today |
|  | Daniela showed me the Cheese & Onion chips they had bought me for me. It made my day. I took TWO on the way out! | Talking to Claudia & Rosie. Copout answer :/. I wasn't overly ecstatic about anything today. Very tired and lacking energy. | Tried cutting my hair shorter than usual. I wish I had gotten the "Something I liked about myself" question today. It would have been a good opportunity to write "how I looked", which is something I'm insecure of and would count as a major win. Maybe it can just be a 4th one for today. |
| Thursday | Something that I accomplished today | Someone I was thankful for today | Today I learned |
|  | Successfully brought myself down from almost having another crisis by dropping anchor / chipping away at the concrete in my head and challenged a core belief that was causing me major distress - that I'm unlovable and will be alone for the rest of my life. I still felt quite awful, ashamed, anxious and shaky afterwards but still much better. One small step for Sam. | Claudia - for teaching me the skills I needed to unhook myself from a distressing situation. I was trying to wait for a good time to write this one and not waste it (stupid rules) | I read that people with Borderline Personality Disorder often have a more reactive amygdala and a less active prefrontal cortex, which makes their emotional responses more intense and harder to control respectively. This fact makes me feel less guilty and ashamed of the way I feel.  |
| Friday | Something that made me think | Something thoughtful I did today | Something I let myself off for today |
|  | I read online that the only constant in life is change. This really helped to overcome that one negative belief about being alone for the rest of my life. Trying to understand and rely on the fact that literally everything is subject to change helps to challenge that belief. My present does not dictate the future.   | Helped mum and sister bring all the groceries in while it was raining.  | Let myself use the air conditioner instead of trying to save money and cool down other ways. |
| Saturday | Something that I liked about myself today | Today I was proud of myself because | One good thing that happened to me today |
|  | Really struggled to come up with an answer for this one today.  | Managed to fall asleep within 30 minutes of getting into bed. Mindfulness has really been helping here. Whenever my brain wonders off into ruminating about something traumatic, it helps to come back and focus on something mundane like breathing. | Starting to enjoy some of my hobbies again. Was able to sit down and work on my website for a few hours, have a decent gaming session and watch the new Hunger Games movie.  |
| Sunday | Something I was happy about today | Something about today I'll always remember | Something I did well today |
|  | Seeing people online talk about my website and how they've been using it to automate their self hosting workflow. Makes me really happy to have made something that people actually like. | Playing Into the Breach for the first time. It's a SciFi strategy chess like videogame. I try heaps of new games all the time, but most don't stick out in any meaningful way. I liked this one because it's still video gamey but it feels like I'm solving a grand puzzle.   | Published a new update for my website - Dictionarry. Covers some basics for music automation via Lidarr. The update milestone didn't cover everything that I wanted to finish, but it includes all the necessities and things people have been asking for. |
