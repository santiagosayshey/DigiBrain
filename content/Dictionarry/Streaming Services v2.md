With version 2 of the streaming service ranking, I wanted to focus on a few key points:

1. Increase immutability by reducing tiers
2. Adding more services (mostly for foreign media)
3. Adjust for new differences in quality.

This list has been compiled using a number of custom formats from the [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/). Some custom formats have been adjusted to fix edge cases. Other custom formats have been added. 

Major Rankings are based on [capeshit.lol](https://capeshit.lol/). For a full understanding of these rankings, please review their comparisons. Other services have been added based on similar bitrates.
