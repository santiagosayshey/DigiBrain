| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `is`       | open, closed, merged, draft, issue, pr | Filters by item state or type. E.g., `is:open` for open issues/PRs, `is:issue` for only issues. | `is:open is:pr` to find all open pull requests |
| `label`    | "label name"                           | Filters by the presence of a specific label. Use quotes for multi-word labels.                  | `label:"high priority"` to find all high priority items |
| `reason`   | completed, reopened, "not planned"     | Filters by the reason an issue was closed or reopened.                                          | `reason:"not planned"` to find issues marked as not planned |
| `assignee` | GitHub username                        | Filters by the assigned user.                                                                   | `assignee:johndoe` to find all items assigned to user johndoe |
| `no`       | label, assignee, reason                | Filters for items lacking a label, assignee, or close/reopen reason.                            | `no:assignee` to find all unassigned items |

Note: You can combine these filters. For example: `is:open label:bug no:assignee` would find all open, unassigned bug reports.
