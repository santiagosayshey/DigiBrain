- Profile Names changed to the 'priority'. This removes ambiguity with things like Optimal and Transparent, where in reality, transparent encodes are usually better than the remux.
- Minimal and compatible don't directly reference a resolution, as they are targeting specific A/V metrics
- 1080p HEVC doesn't prioritise a source, since it can grab an encode or WEB interchangeably.

| Description | The level of detail, clarity, and overall fidelity of the audio or video. Higher levels indicate better quality. | The effectiveness in terms of resource usage, such as file size, bandwidth, and processing power. Higher levels indicate better efficiency.<br><br>Measured using level of transparency and how that transparency is achieved. | The ability to work across different devices, platforms, and formats. Higher levels indicate better compatibility.<br><br>Measured by determining if releases have: HDR, Lossless audio, HEVC or 4k resolution, high bitrate. |

Includes all 5 of the compatibility metrics. No single device can direct play every possible combination of these A/V metrics. You will run into issues eventually. A hefty internet connection is required to stream these files. At least 100Mbps.                                                            |

An Nvidia Shield Pro *should* be able to handle everything here. 1080p Remuxes are included here as they often have TrueHD + Atmos / DTS-X. Encodes with lossless audio can be ignored if the user wants that. A hefty internet connection is required to stream these files. At least 50Mbps. |
