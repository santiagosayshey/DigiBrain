- Profile Names changed to the 'priority'. This removes ambiguity with things like Optimal and Transparent, where in reality, transparent encodes are usually better than the remux.
- Minimal and compatible don't directly reference a resolution, as they are targeting specific A/V metrics
- 1080p HEVC doesn't prioritise a source, since it can grab an encode or WEB interchangeably.

| Description | The level of detail, clarity, and overall fidelity of the audio or video. Higher levels indicate better quality. | The effectiveness in terms of resource usage, such as file size, bandwidth, and processing power. Higher levels indicate better efficiency.<br><br>Measured using level of transparency and how that transparency is achieved. | The ability to work across different devices, platforms, and formats. Higher levels indicate better compatibility.<br><br>Measured by determining if releases have: HDR, Lossless audio, HEVC or 4k resolution, high bitrate. |

You're absolutely right, let me revisit the table carefully based on the information you provided:

|     | Quality | Efficiency | Compatibility |
|-----|---------|------------|----------------|
| 1   | 2160p Remux - Highest quality with no encoding/compression losses. | Extremely inefficient with massive file sizes since it's an untouched remux of the source.| Requires cutting-edge hardware and very high bandwidth (100Mbps+). Includes 4K resolution, HDR, lossless audio like Atmos/TrueHD. Compatibility issues across devices.|
| 2   | 2160p Encode - Very high quality 4K encode, not quite remux level but very capable. | Uses efficient HEVC codec but still requires significant resources due to 4K resolution.| Includes 4K, HDR, and often lossless audio. Should play on modern 4K HDR devices like Nvidia Shield, limited by lacking certain codec/audio support on some devices.|
| 3   | 1080p HDR Encode / 2160p WEB - High bitrate 1080p HDR or 2160p encodes from streaming sources.| Reasonable efficiency using HEVC codec at 1080p or compressed 2160p from streaming service.| 1080p HDR has HDR and high bitrates. 2160p WEB lacks lossless audio but has 4K resolution. Some compatibility issues remain.|
| 4   | 1080p Encode / 1080p Remux - Standard 1080p encodes or remuxes with no HDR.| 1080p remuxes inefficient, 1080p encodes relatively efficient using AVC/x264 codec. | 1080p remux includes lossless audio. 1080p encodes are widely compatible but may lack HDR or lossless audio.|
| 5   | 720p Encode / SD Encode / Minimal - Lower resolution or ultra-efficient encodes prioritizing size over quality.| Highly efficient using heavy compression and lower resolutions/bitrates.| SD and minimal releases should play on any device. 720p may have some very minor compatibility quirks.|
