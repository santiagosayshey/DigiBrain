- Profile Names changed to the 'priority'. This removes ambiguity with things like Optimal and Transparent, where in reality, transparent encodes are usually better than the remux.
- Minimal and compatible don't directly reference a resolution, as they are targeting specific A/V metrics
- 1080p HEVC doesn't prioritise a source, since it can grab an encode or WEB interchangeably.

| Description | The level of detail, clarity, and overall fidelity of the audio or video. Higher levels indicate better quality. | The effectiveness in terms of resource usage, such as file size, bandwidth, and processing power. Higher levels indicate better efficiency.<br><br>Measured using level of transparency and how that transparency is achieved. | The ability to work across different devices, platforms, and formats. Higher levels indicate better compatibility.<br><br>Measured by determining if releases have: HDR, Lossless audio, HEVC or 4k resolution, high bitrate. |

| 5   | The highest quality releases, retaining all the original detail and fidelity of the source material. These are untouched remuxes with no compression, providing the full bitrate of the source. Includes 4K resolution + HDR and lossless audio formats like Dolby TrueHD or DTS-X. | Properly uses HEVC to achieve a higher level of quality only possible at higher bitrates / resolutions at h264. | Should be able to comfortably play these files everywhere, and stream them with a minimal internet connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4   | Transparent high bitrate encodes retaining all visual details details from a 4k source. These *can* be better than a remux on occasion by fixing defects in the source, but this often not the case in practice. Can include lossless audio if the user wants.                      | Highly efficient HEVC releases that might be a bit bigger / smaller that nessecary.                             | High bitrates. Most devices should be able to play these files, but you should have at least a 30Mbps internet connection to stream them.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | High quality, transparent encodes that often fix defects in the source, or untouched remuxes. Limited to 1080p with no HDR. Can include lossless audio if remuxes are grabbed.                                                                                                      | h264 releases with balanced bitrates. Often a 1080p WEB, or a 720p / SD encode.                                 | Either HEVC (Some issues playing on browsers), or HDR + high bitrates. Make sure you have fast enough internet to stream, and a HDR capable setup (or the ability to tonemap).                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2   | Balanced releases. 1080p WEBs or HEVC encodes and transparent 720p encodes. Lossy audio and moderate bitrates.                                                                                                                                                                      | Transparent x264 encodes. Saves significant space compared to remux, but still quite large.                     | Includes 4 of the 5 compatibility metrics at most. An Nvidia Shield Pro *should* be able to handle everything here. 1080p Remuxes are included here as they often have TrueHD + Atmos / DTS-X. Encodes with lossless audio can be ignored if the user wants that. A hefty internet connection is required to stream these files. At least 50Mbps. |
| 1   | Highly efficient encodes focused on small file sizes over quality. Noticeable compression artifacts and loss of detail compared to higher tiers. <br><br>                                                                                                                           | Untouched remuxes. Highest possible bitrates with no attempt to make efficient.                                 | Requires a top-of-the-line setup. Includes all 5 of the compatibility metrics. No single device can direct play every possible combination of these A/V metrics. You will run into issues eventually. A hefty internet connection is required to stream these files. At least 100Mbps.                                                            |
