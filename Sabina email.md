Hi Sabina,

I'm Sam from the Synapsis team - I was the one who presented the technical side during yesterday's semi-final.

I just wanted to reach out and thank you for your support throughout this process. Michelle mentioned that you shared some feedback about how our presentation went, and it was incredibly reassuring to hear that you felt we did well. 

She also mentioned that you offered to help with our positioning for the final presentation. After some consideration, we'd prefer to present last if that's possible. I think it would help me feel more comfortable to settle into the environment first. 

Thank you again for all your support!

Best regards, Sam
